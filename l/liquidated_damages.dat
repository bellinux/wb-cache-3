Pearce {{and the head of}} the Baltic Shipyard Mikhail Casi, representing Alexander II, signed the contract on September 5, 1879. Pearce agreed to complete the job by July 1, 1880. The deal excluded interior finishes, to be completed in Russia. Unusually for the period, Pearce agreed to guarantee the speed of an experimental craft. According to the contract, the full price was payable only if the ship attained 15 knots. Under-performance was punishable by hefty <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages,</b> and the Russians reserved the right for a full money back guarantee if the ship failed to make 14 knots. They agreed to pay generous premiums if speed and engine power exceeded design targets of 15 knots and 12,000 indicated horsepowers. Pearce was instructed to build his own state-of-the-art steam engines, with no cap on maximum power output. The Russians subscribed to supply the complete electrical system, including arc lighting by Yablochkov candles. The British press discussed the unusual project and concluded it was a test bed for future military ships and their powerplants in particular.|$|E

40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{economics}} of three different contracting problerrls. TIle first cltapter considers the contracting problem facing multiple principals, each of whom de-sires to contract with the same agent. If the agent has private infonnation regarding his gains froDl the contracting activity and the con~racting activities in tIle principal-agent relationships are substitutable (coDlplementary), the principals will typically extract less (more) infonnation rents in total and induce less (more) productive i~lefficiency in the contracting equilibrium than {{if there were a}} sillgle principal contracting over the SaIne activities. This analysis is subsequently applied to various environments, illcluding joint ventures, exclusive-dealing relationships, and regulation between conflictillg governInen-tal agencies. The second chapter considers the potential use of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> clauses under asymmetric infonnation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sharing of}} risk under three different remedies for breach of contract. The risk considered arises from the possibility that, after a seller and buyer have entered into an agreement for the exchange of some (not generally available) good, a third party who values the good more than the original buyer may come along before delivery has occurred; the seller will want to breach. It is shown that this risk is optimally allocated by the expectation damage remedy if the seller is risk neutral and the buyer is risk averse, by the specific performance remedy if the opposite is true, and by a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> remedy if both parties are risk averse. The level of <b>damages</b> under the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> remedy is also shown to be bounded by the expectation measure of damages and a "damage equivalent" to the specific performance remedy. By means of a numerical example, it is shown that use of the prevailing remedy for breach of contract [...] the expectation damage remedy [...] may plausibly cause a welfare loss {{of as much as}} 20 % due to inappropriate risk sharing. ...|$|R

2500|$|Remedies {{are often}} agreed in a {{contract}}, {{so that if}} one side fails to perform the contract will dictate what happens. A simple, common and automatic remedy is to have taken a deposit, and to retain it {{in the event of}} non-performance. However, the courts will often treat any deposit that exceeds 10 per cent of the contract price as excessive. A special justification will be required before any greater sum may be retained as a deposit. The courts will view a large deposit, even if expressed in crystal clear language, as a part payment of the contract which if unperformed must be restored in order to prevent unjust enrichment. Nevertheless, where commercial parties of equal bargaining power wish to insist on circumstances in which a deposit will be forfeit and insist precisely on the letter of their deal, the courts will not interfere. In Union Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd a purchaser of a building in Hong Kong for HK$4.2million had a contract stipulating completion must take place by 5pm on 30 September 1991 and that if not a 10 per cent deposit would be forfeited and the contract rescinded. The purchaser was 10 minutes late only, but the Privy Council advised that given the necessity of certain rules and to remove business' fear of courts exercising unpredictable discretion, the agreement would be strictly enforced. Agreements may also state that, as opposed to a sum fixed by the courts, a particular sum of [...] "liquidated damages" [...] will be paid upon non-performance. The courts place an outer-limit on <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> clauses if they became so high, or [...] "extravagant and unconscionable" [...] as to look like a penalty. Penalty clauses in contracts are generally not enforceable. [...] However this jurisdiction is exercised rarely, so in Murray v Leisureplay plc the Court of Appeal held that a severance payment of a whole year's salary to a company's Chief Executive in the event of dismissal before a year was not a penalty clause. Additionally, the ability of courts to strike down clauses as penalties only applies to clauses for payment of money upon the breach of the contract rather than events during its performance, though the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 confers jurisdiction to interfere with unfair terms used against consumers.|$|E
40|$|Contract law’s <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> rules prevent {{enforcement}} of contractual damage measures {{that require the}} promisor, if it breaches, to transfer to the promisee a sum that exceeds the net gain the promisee expected to make from performance; but these rules permit the promisor to transfer less than the promisee’s expectation. We define a contractual damage multiplier as any number between zero and infinity by which the promisee’s expected gain [...] its expectation interest [...] is multiplied. Multipliers of one or less thus comply with the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> rules while multipliers that exceed one do not; the high multipliers are unenforceable penalties. This paper shows that multipliers of any size can be efficient or inefficient, depending on the parties’ purposes in creating them. For example, a multiplier that exceeds one will decrease welfare if used by a seller with market power to deter entry; but will increase welfare if used by parties to induce efficient relation specific investment. As a consequence, a court should inquire, not into {{the size of the}} multiplier, but into the purpose the multiplier serves for the parties. The practical implication of this view is that it no longer should be a sufficient defense to an action to enforce a contractual damage measure that the parties’ multiplier exceeded one...|$|R
40|$|Part I of this Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions and penalties {{in the context of}} a general theory of efficient breach of contract. The proof problems inherent in fully recovering idiosyncratic values within the context of operationally practical damage sanctions may prevent the non-breaching party from recovering his subjective expectations if recovery is limited to legally determined remedies. The expected cost of establishing true losses under conventional damage measures will thus induce parties who face uncertain or nonprovable anticipated losses to negotiate stipulated damage agreements. The current penalty rule subjects these agreements to costly review, based not on the fairness of the process, but on whether the initial estimate sufficiently mirrors the anticipated provable loss. Part II {{examines the}} hypothesis that, absent evidence of process unfairness in bargaining, efficiency will be enhanced by the enforcement of an agreed allocation of risks embodied in a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> clause. We argue that agreed damage measures and in terrorem provisions represent, under many circumstances, the most efficient means by which parties can insure against the otherwise non-compensable consequences of breach. Our hypothesis is then also tested against a series of conditions in order to identify alternative legal principles that may provide less costly means of avoiding the harmful effects whose perception apparently prompted the current penalty rule...|$|R

2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damages</b> unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|E

The fulfillment of this task is essential for a correct understanding of the current debate on the making of a European private law and can greatly help in elucidating the background of central issues in European contract law (i. e. consumer protection).
