50|$|A {{full anneal}} {{typically}} {{results in the}} second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a full anneal on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is let cool down inside) {{but in some cases}} it's air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very hardenable (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite</b> in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties.|$|E

Degenerate pearlite which contains fine cementite particles even at the growth front was observed with other structures such as proeutectoid ferrite, <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite</b> and bainite in a temperature range between 773 K and 923 K.

40|$|The {{eutectoid}} transformation of austenite can occur cooperatively (pearlite transformation) or {{by means of}} a non-cooperative mode (Divorced Eutectoid Transformation).

In this study, the parameters promoting the occurrence of DET in a hypereutectoid steel (austenitization temperature, cooling rate, presence of proeutectoid cementite in the initial microstructure) were investigated.

The proeutectoid ferrite grains are elongated along the magnetic field direction, which can be explained as follows: the proeutectoid ferrite becomes the magnetic dipolar under high magnetic field, and then the polarized austenite atoms are much easier to diffuse into ferrite grains along the magnetic field direction. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>lamellar</b> growth of <b>pearlite</b> {{at the expense}} of austenite during the eutectoid transformation in steel. To begin with, we extend the Jackson-Hunt-type calculation (previously used to analyze eutectic transformation) to eutectoid transformation by accounting for diffusion in all the phases. Our principal finding is that the growth rates in presence of diffusion in all the phases is different as compared to the case when diffusion in growing phases is absent. The difference in the dynamics is described by a factor 'ρ' which comprises of the ratio of the diffusivities of the bulk and the growing phases, along with the ratios of the slopes of the phase co-existence lines. Thereafter, we perform phase-field simulations, the results of which are in agreement with analytical predictions. The phase-field simulations also reveal that diffusion in austenite as well as ferrite leads to the formation of tapered cementite along with an overall increase in the transformation kinetics as compared to diffusion in austenite (only).

In the present work the kinetics of austenite formation in Fe-C alloys during rapid, non-isothermal heating conditions, characterized by high heating rates and short austenitization periods, were studied by means of computational simulation. Austenitization of lamellar pearlite/proeutectoid ferrite microstructures was simulated by assuming two kinetically distinct stages: i) dissolution of <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite</b> followed by ii) dissolution of proeutectoid ferrite.

Results indicate that the ratio of pearlite/ferrite is about 9 : 1 and the graphite size is less than 40 μm in diameter in the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy.

The specimens were studied in two states : 1) before modification (original state) and 2) after nitriding in the surface layer of the specimen. The study was conducted on thin foils. It was found that nitriding lead to {{significant changes in the}} structure of steel, namely in its phase composition and in the number of existing phases. In the original state the structure of steel was given as <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite,</b> ferritic carbide mix and fragmented ferrite. After 550 V nitriding it was lath martensite, plates of α-phase, with colonies of thin parallel plates of γ-phase and coarse grains of α-phase, containing γ-phase grains which were different in size and shape and were various-directional. Increase in nitriding voltage up to 600 V lead to change in the structure given as a lamellar non-fragmented pearlite and fragmented ferrite. The original state was marked by presence of particles of M 3 C cementite, after nitriding irrespective of the voltage it had the particles of M 3 C alloyed cementite, Fe 3 Mo 3 N nitride and Cr 2 C 0. 61 N 0. 39 carbonitride. The sizes, volume fractions and locations of particles were dependent on nitriding voltage...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of heavily drawn pearlitic wires can reach values exceeding 4 GPa. However, to obtain this effect a careful {{control of the}} drawing process and of the pearlite microstructure is necessary. In the latter case, microstructural investigations should provide information allowing for an optimal design of a failure-free production process. Yet, the number of methods for the characterization of pearlite, despite a large variety of its possible microstructure forms, is limited. This, in turn, causes problems for further improvements of the pearlite properties. It {{is the goal of}} this work to create a tool for extended characterization of the eutectoid. Before this tool is presented, an overview of the possible pearlite microstructures is given. It begins with a review of nucleation and growth models, followed by information about a broadly understood relation between applied heat treatment and its effect on the microstructure of the eutectoid. The subject of pearlite microstructures is then supplemented with information about other variants of the eutectoid, namely hypoeutectoid and globularized pearlite. Subsequently, the currently used methods for microstructure characterization are presented. The chapter closes with a survey of the reports on the link between pearlite microstructure and its performance. After having presented the microstructure-property relationships, the new tool for the description of the eutectoid microstructures is introduced. This begins with an account of the application of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique for the determination of the link between the ferrite microtexture and the corresponding microstructure as depicted by scanning electron microscope micrographs. This was meant to serve as the base for the application of EBSD for determination of the mean pearlite colony size. The obtained results showed, however, that the pearlite boundary network is far more complex than the concept of pearlite colony. It also became clear that the crystallographic orientation of the ferrite matrix inside a pearlite colony is not constant. In most of the examined colonies orientation gradients were found, often including changes of the orientation of the misorientation axis. Those gradients were found in as-transformed, as well as in severely globularized pearlite. The picture of the eutectoid given by EBSD is further supplemented by examination of hypoeutectoid steels. Inspection of the continuity of the proeutectoid and the eutectoid ferrite showed that two variants can be found: continuous passage and separation by a high angle boundary. Subsequently, a new image analysis method for characterization of pearlite microstructures is presented. This begins with a new routine for the description of the soundness of fully <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite.</b> The performed experiments showed that this tool is capable of capturing the effect of carbon content and the austenite decomposition temperature upon the parameter in question. Further, morphologies other than lamellar are considered. For mixed, i. e. globular-lamellar pearlite, a new, automated procedure is proposed for separation of the two morphological components. Additionally a routine is presented for a comprehensive description of the globularized pearlite. Next, results of the experimental validation of the program are presented. This comprised of a microstructural investigation of globularized pearlite, tensile tests and hardness measurements. The performed analysis confirmed the close microstructure-property relationship and supported the application of the Hall-Petch relationship for mixed morphologies. The analysis also pointed out a direct link between the ultimate tensile strength and the hardness of the material.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{measure in}} steel processing industry is achieving the required mechanical properties and micro {{structure of the}} material. A new phenomenon has been discovered recently which allows to refine ferrite grain significantly and to spheroidise carbides over {{a very short time}} compared to conventional heat treatment techniques. The newly developed technology based on the ASR (Accelerated Spheroidisation and Refinement) effect consists in heating a steel workpiece through thickness to a temperature no higher than Ac 1 and in subsequent plastic deformation. The energy introduced through plastic deformation causes the workpiece temperature to increase. This temperature increase, however, is not uniform throughout the workpiece cross-section, leading to substantial inhomogeneity. Fully austenitized regions, partially austenitized regions, and areas where no phase transformation occurred, coexist. In locations previously subjected to intensive plastic deformation, cementite lamellae disintegrate and globular carbides form. In regions subjected to milder plastic deformation, spheroidisation does not occur directly {{in the course of the}} thermomechanical treatment. Despite, the cementite lamellae show a stronger tendency to spheroidise during subsequent annealing. The combination of a suitable pre-heating temperature, an appropriate amount of strain and a possible reheating leads to transformation of initial ferrite-pearlite micro structure with <b>lamellar</b> <b>pearlite</b> into desired ferrite matrix with spheroidised carbides. Key microstructure parameters governing the properties of ferrite-pearlite steels include exactly the ferrite grain size, the distribution of defects within the ferrite grain and the distribution and morphology of carbides. The present article describes a new thermomechanical treatment technique which allows controlling these microstructure parameters and related mechanical properties in order to achieve their favourable combination in structural carbon steel C 45. The processing time is very short when compared to several-hour conventional heat treatments. This offers potential for achieving desired mechanical properties with time and energy savings...|$|E
40|$|Eutectoid {{decomposition}} in steels {{can result}} in either a <b>lamellar</b> (<b>pearlite)</b> or non-lamellar (bainite) microconstituent. Similarly, in Ti-X alloys, both a lamellar and non-lamellar microconstituent have been observed following eutectoid decomposition. It {{has been suggested that}} the lamellar and non-lamellar microconstituents observed in Ti-X alloys are synonymous with pearlite and bainite in steels. This thesis presents a thorough review of all relevant literature on eutectoid decomposition in Ti-X alloys as well as pearlite and bainite in steels. A programme of experimental work has been conducted covering nine Ti-X alloys; a hypoeutectoid, eutectoid and hypereutectoid alloy of each Ti-Co, Ti-Cr and Ti-Mn. Various heat treatments were completed including isothermal, slow cooling and thermomechanical treatments. Only eutectoid and hypereutectoid Ti-Co contained the lamellar microconstituent. All remaining alloys contained a non-lamellar microconstituent. The lamellar microconstituent formed from both plates of alpha(Ti) and allotriomorphs of Ti 2 Co. Heat treatment at progressively higher undercooling resulted in the lamellar microconstituent being increasingly replaced by a spheroidal microconstituent. The non-lamellar microconstituent consisted of plates of alpha(Ti) separated by beta(Ti) with the intermetallic phase at alpha(Ti); beta(Ti) boundaries. Once the reaction had reached completion no beta(Ti) remained. Definitions for pearlite and bainite have been presented based upon well documented experimental evidence. The Ti-X lamellar and non-lamellar microconstituents {{have been shown to be}} synonymous with pearlite and bainite in steels based upon these definitions. Pearlite and bainite have also been shown to form by distinct mechanisms and it is therefore incorrect for them to be considered as products which are in any sense opposites to each other. A new hypothesis has been proposed suggesting that it is not pearlite and bainite that are competing processes in Ti-X alloys, but pearlite and the formation of alpha(Ti) plates. This can be extended to decomposition in any eutectoid system that might be viewed as the competition between pearlite and plate formation...|$|E
