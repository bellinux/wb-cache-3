25|$|North of Le Roy, the Oatka {{becomes a}} <b>losing</b> <b>stream,</b> with water {{disappearing into the}} ground. In the warmer months this results in the creekbed drying up above Buttermilk Falls, and slowly re-emerging further down from springs and seeps. After it does, and turns to the east, it flows over the Akron Dolomite, Bertie Group of dolomitic shales, and the Salina Group. The latter is diverse, {{including}} evaporites such as halite and gypsum {{in addition to its}} limestones and shales.|$|E

The spring is located near the Slovene-Italian border at [...] above sea level, in a drainage divide between the Adriatic and Danube basins. The Sava Dolinka spring is fed by groundwater possibly exhibiting bifurcation of source karst aquifer to the Sava and Soča basins. Nadiža creek, a short <b>losing</b> <b>stream</b> flowing nearby, {{is the source of}} Zelenci Pools water. The Sava Dolinka is considered the Sava's initial, [...] segment.|$|E
500|$|The {{hydrological}} regime {{of the basin}} and Popovo Polje {{is determined by the}} flow of the Trebišnjica—a <b>losing</b> <b>stream</b> disappearing underground in the polje. The groundwater is distributed to a number of springs. Some of them are headwaters of watercourses discharging into the Neretva River to the northwest of the polje, or appearing as vruljas (submarine springs) or as headwaters of the Ombla river. Flow rate of the Ombla River, measured at the Komolac water intake plant, ranges from [...] per second, averaging [...] per second. The average has dropped by about [...] per second since completion of Trebišnjica Hydroelectric Power Plant and the concreting of the Trebišnjica's river bed. On the other hand, the minimum discharge was not affected by the river engineering works.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{time the}} Oatka was called Allan's Creek after the area's first settler, Ebenezer [...] "Indian" [...] Allan. Its {{waterpower}} facilitated early 19th-century European settlement of the abundant fertile lands in the Holland Purchase. Today it remains an important regional resource, used for water supply and recreational purposes, and actively protected to assure water quality. It is a popular trout stream, stocked from the oldest fish hatchery in the Western Hemisphere near its mouth. A dam in Le Roy makes the section below it a <b>losing</b> <b>stream,</b> dry during the warm {{months of the year}} as the stream flows through subterranean channels.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} a railway tunnel on {{groundwater}} and surface waters in the Northern Apennines (Italy) was demonstrated and characterised by multi-tracer tests and hydrological observations. The 15 -km-long Firenzuola tunnel crosses turbidite marls and sandstones previously not considered as aquifers. During the drilling, water inrushes occurred at fracture zones, and the tunnel still continues to drain the aquifer. The water table dropped {{below the level of}} the valleys, and gaining <b>streams</b> transformed into <b>losing</b> <b>streams</b> or ran completely dry, as did many springs, causing severe damage to the aquatic fauna and other elements of the ecosystem. Two multi-tracer tests, each using uranine and sulforhodamine G, were carried out in two impacted catchments in order to confirm and quantify the stream–aquifer–tunnel interrelations. The results proved connection between <b>losing</b> <b>streams</b> and numerous water inlets in the tunnel, with maximum linear distances of 1. 4 km and velocities up to 135 m/d. Several of the demonstrated flowpaths pass under previous groundwater divides (mountain ridges), proving that the tunnel has completely modified the regional flow system. Water balance estimations demonstrate that the observed water losses cannot be explained by climate change but can largely be attributed to the tunnel drainage...|$|R

40|$|<b>Losing</b> <b>streams</b> {{that are}} {{influenced}} by wastewater treatment plant effluents and combined sewer overflows (CSO's) can {{be a source of}} groundwater contamination. Released micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupters and other ecotoxicologically relevant substances as well as inorganic wastewater constituents can reach the groundwater, where they may deteriorate groundwater quality. This paper presents a method to quantify exfiltration mass flow rates Mex of wastewater constituents from <b>losing</b> <b>streams</b> by the operation of integral pumping tests (IPT's) up- and downstream of a target section. Due to the large sampled water volume during IPT's the results are more reliable than those from conventional point sampling. We applied the method at a test site in Leipzig (Germany). Wastewater constituents K+ and NO 3 &minus; showed Mex values of 1241 to 4315 and 749 to 924 mg m&minus; 1 stream d&minus; 1 , respectively, while Cl&minus; (16. 8 to 47. 3 g m&minus; 1 stream d&minus; 1 ) and SO 4 2 &minus; (20. 3 to 32. 2 g m&minus; 1 stream d&minus; 1 ) revealed the highest observed Mex values at the test site. The micropollutants caffeine and technical-nonylphenol were dominated by elimination processes in the groundwater between upstream and downstream wells. Additional concentration measurements in the stream and a connected sewer at the test site were performed to identify relevant processes that influence the concentrations at the IPT wells...|$|R

50|$|Spring discharge, or resurgence, is {{determined}} by the spring's recharge basin. Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, {{and the size of the}} spring outlet. Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and <b>losing</b> <b>streams.</b> In some cases entire creeks seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system. The water emerges 9 mi away, forming some of the discharge of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.|$|R

40|$|High-speed railway tunnels in the Northern Apennines caused {{large-scale}} groundwater drainage of turbiditic sandstone units, {{resulting in}} the drying up of springs and stream baseflow. In order to better characterise the connections between the <b>losing</b> <b>streams</b> and the tunnels, multi-tracer tests were done at four catchments, {{one of which is}} presented here. Uranine was used for all experiments and proved to be the best tracer; lithium, sulforhodamine G and tinopal CBS-X were additionally used for some experiments. The results proved connections between the streams and water inlets in the tunnels, with maximum linear distances of 1. 3 km, mainly along faults. The flowpath partly run across previous water divides, suggesting that the tunnels have entirely altered the natural drainage system. Although restoration of the natural situation is impossible as long as the tunnels continue to drain the aquifer, different technical measures for the maintenance of a minimum stream baseflow were evaluated...|$|R

The area between Rijeka and Vinodol contains numerous freshwater springs that are largely tapped for water supply systems.

30|$|High {{groundwater}} velocities have {{physical and}} chemical impacts on karst aquifer. These velocities allow great volumes of water {{to move through the}} aquifer and may dissolve the aquifer material and enlarge pore spaces. Large volumes of water can be drained directly from the surface into a carbonate aquifer that has solution-enhanced permeability. As a result, when a carbonate aquifer is at the land surface, the landscape has very few surface water features. Water from the surface drains directly into an aquifer through features like sinks and <b>losing</b> <b>streams</b> and may discharge at the surface only at seeps and springs. Drainage occurs within the aquifer, this internal drainage is typical of a karst system and we considered it as pipe lines in the form of fractures and in general taking high curvature lines in the form of vertical and horizontal channels. The most developed parts of the flow system are labeled conduits, which are horizontal and vertical channels that have been altered by the solution of the bed rock.|$|R

The setting up of the two presented models is based on hydrogeological monitoring data and results of flow measurements and tracer tests. Maximum flow rates subtracted to streams baseflow by the tunnel along the connection structures are calculated for the two streams with major impact...|$|R
