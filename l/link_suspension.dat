5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E engine model was {{introduced}} especially for Asian markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading <b>link</b> <b>suspension,</b> and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four <b>link</b> <b>suspension</b> with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2006 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 40 - 41) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 41 leavesIn this study, {{the natural}} frequencies, body displacements, velocities, and accelerations of a quarter-car with double wishbone suspension are examined {{by considering the}} proportionally damped system. Two models of quarter-car suspension system are idealized employing two different assumptions due to the <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> to describe the dynamic behaviour of vehicles running on base excitation. In the first model, the <b>links</b> of the <b>suspension</b> {{are assumed to be}} rigid and the stiffness and mass matrices of the model are obtained by using the analytical method. In the second model, the <b>links</b> of the <b>suspension</b> are assumed to be flexible and the elastic stiffness, mass, and geometric stiffness matrices are obtained by using Finite Element Method. In order to express the linear equation of motion, <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> forces required for the geometric stiffness matrices are assumed as constant. Also, the oscillations of the <b>suspension</b> <b>links</b> are neglected since the base displacement is chosen in small amplitude. Two Matlab programs regarding the aforementioned models have been developed. Firstly, the natural frequencies of the models are found. Then, the displacements, velocities, and acceleration of the car body are presented in graphical forms for the specified car speed. The excellent agreement between results of the analytical model and finite element model is observed for both natural frequencies and the time reponses. The effect of loads on <b>suspension</b> <b>link</b> on the dynamic behaviour of suspension system is also studied...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A most {{important}} issue in vehicle industry is the existence of differences in the physical properties and manufacturing methodologies. Deterministic approaches are incapable {{to take into account}} these variabilities without leading to oversized structures. The necessity of assessing the robustness of a particular design requires a methodology based on strength and design optimization through probabilistic models of design variables (DOE). In general it is identified the steering knuckle {{which is one of the}} critical components of vehicle which <b>links</b> <b>suspension,</b> steering system, wheel hub and brake to the chassis.
