These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the <b>limited</b> <b>flow</b> rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|E

40|$|Strong {{resilience}} {{properties of}} dynamical flow networks are analyzed for distributed routing policies. The latter {{are characterized by}} the property that the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle densities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network {{is defined as the}} infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which the network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node to be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing policies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the maximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for an acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The maximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node residual capacity of the network. The latter depends on the <b>limit</b> <b>flow</b> of the unperturbed network and is defined as the minimum, among all the non-destination nodes, of the sum, over all the links outgoing from the node, {{of the differences between the}} maximum flow capacity and the <b>limit</b> <b>flow</b> of the unperturbed network. We propose a simple convex optimization problem to solve for equilibrium <b>limit</b> <b>flows</b> of the unperturbed network that minimize average delay subject to strong resilience guarantees, and discuss the use of tolls to induce such an equilibrium <b>limit</b> <b>flow</b> in transportation networks. Finally, we present illustrative simulations to discuss the connection between cascaded failures and the resilience properties of the network. Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures, journal submissio...|$|R

Radiation levels are also notably lower around the lower parts of the [...] "Drywell", suggesting that fuel had not reached the bottom of the containment vessel, or damaged the concrete floor slab. There is a further issue in that radiation levels within the water inside the containment are markedly higher than those in the reactor basements, suggesting that either there is <b>limited</b> <b>flow</b> from the PCV to the basement, or that substantial dilution is taking place - raising the issue of what is the flow path for the water.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for finding a maximum flow {{in a network}} need not terminate if we allow the arc capacities to take irrational values. Every non-terminating example converges to a <b>limit</b> <b>flow,</b> but this <b>limit</b> <b>flow</b> {{need not be a}} maximum flow. Hence, one may pass to the limit and begin the algorithm again. In this way, we may view the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm as a transfinite algorithm. We analyze the transfinite running-time of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm using ordinal numbers, and prove that the worst case running-time is ω^Θ(|E|). For the lower bound, we show that we can model the Euclidean algorithm via Ford-Fulkerson on an auxiliary network. By running this example on a pair of incommensurable numbers, we obtain a new robust non-terminating example. We then describe how to glue k copies of our Euclidean example in parallel to obtain running-time ω^k. An upper bound of ω^|E| is established via induction on |E|. We conclude by illustrating a close connection to transfinite chip-firing as previously investigated by the first author. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
