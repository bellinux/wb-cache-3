This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that she <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E

Homer <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the cable hook-up. Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of violations of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E

Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Survivalism and {{disaster}} preparation are prevalent {{themes in the}} novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which {{had been turned into}} fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster. Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.|$|E

5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|Northwest Italy is the viticultural {{home for}} Barbera, but Italian {{immigrants}} spread it {{through much of}} the New World, where its acidity is valued in blended wines for the 'freshness' it imparts. Barbera is found in the northwestern part of Italy, particularly in Monferrato, {{and to a lesser extent}} further south. Nearly half of all grape vine plantings in Piedmont are Barbera. It <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> same conditions as Nebbiolo, but the latter is more profitable, fetching nearly twice, so is grown on the best sites. The earlier-ripening Barbera is grown on the cooler lower slopes below the Nebbiolo, and other secondary locations. This explains why relatively little Barbera is grown around Alba, where the wines are entitled to the appellation Barbera d'Alba. Thus the best known Barbera is the DOCG of Barbera d'Asti. The Barbera del Monferrato DOC - which tends to be somewhat sparkling (frizzante) - is seldom exported.|$|E
