One of the main challenges facing the Republic of South Africa (RSA) today is the HIV/AIDS epidemic (NSP, 2007 : 17). By mid-year 2011 {{an estimated}} 5. 38 million people (10. 6 % of the total population) were living with HIV/AIDS in the RSA (Statistics South Africa, 2011 : 2). Currently South Africa has {{the largest number of}} people enrolled in the Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment programme (HAART) in the world (WHO, 2008 : 59). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine retrospectively the medicine treatment patterns of HAART at a district hospital in the North West Province of South Africa. The study was conducted at Thusong hospital in the Ditsobotla sub-district of the North West Province of South Africa. A non-experimental, retrospective, cross-sectional, drug utilisation research methodology was used to obtain the data. The target population included patients of all ages who visited Thusong hospital pharmacy during the data collection period, which commenced on 01 February 2012 and ended on 31 March 2012. The data of three hundred and ninety nine (N= 399) adult and one hundred and sixty one (N= 161) paediatric patients on HAART were used. The adult female patients accounted for almost 70 % (n= 276, 69. 17 %) and the adult male patients for only 30 % (n= 123, 30. 83 %). The male paediatric patients represented just over 60 % (n= 97, 60. 25 %), whereas the female paediatric patients comprised less than 40 % (n= 64, 39. 75 %). The majority of adult patients were unmarried (n= 323, 80. 95 %) and this group of patients were also the youngest group (μ= 36. 38 ± 8. 98 years) on ARV treatment. Almost 86 % (85. 96 %, n= 343) of adult patients were registered as unemployed. Ninety two (n= 92, 23. 06 %) adult patients and fifty eight (n= 58, 36. 03 %) paediatric patients defaulted treatment during the defined period. The investigation into the adult medicine treatment patterns revealed that more than half (52. 38 %, n= 209) of all the adult patients were receiving regimen 1 atn (EFV, TDF and 3 TC), followed by 20. 80 % (n= 83) on regimen 1 a (EFV, D 4 T and 3 TC). Most paediatric patients (n= 73, 45. 34 %) were on regimen P 1 c (EFV, D 4 T and 3 TC) and the second most (n= 45, 27. 95 %) were on regimen P 1 a (D 4 T, 3 TC and LPV/r). The average weight of adult female patients was 57. 18 kg (± 15. 78 kg) and the average adult male patient weighed 55. 87 kg (± 10. 17 kg) on initiation of HAART. The average adult male patient was initiated on HAART with a CD 4 count of 130 cells/mm 3 (± 99. 45 cells/mm 3), while for adult female patients it was 160 cells/mm 3 (± 96. 52 cells/mm 3). The average male child was initiated with a CD 4 count of 509. 1 cells/mm 3 and the average female paediatric patient with 477. 3 cells/mm 3. The average viral load for adult female patients on initiation of HAART was 103046 copies/mm 3 (± 189146 copies/mm 3) and for adult male patients it was 416600 copies/mm 3 (± 439746 copies/mm 3). The difference between the viral load of adult female and male patients were described as statistically (p= 0. 0006) and practically (d= 0. 713) significant. The average viral load for female paediatric patients on initiation of HAART was 242207 copies/mm 3 (± 709133 copies/mm 3) and for male paediatric patients it was 329734 copies/mm 3 (± 674532 copies/mm 3). Adult patients that received HAART at more than 12 consultations revealed an average weight gain of 3. 43 kg (± 8. 11 kg) from initiation of treatment. This group also showed an average increase of 214. 71 cells/mm 3 (± 248. 24 cells/mm 3) in CD 4 count and an average reduction in viral load of 170944 copies/mm 3 (± 191854. 69 copies/mm 3) from the day they started HAART up to the last date of receiving treatment. The paediatric patients on treatment for more than 12 consultations showed an average weight gain of 6. 56 kg (± 3. 75 kg) from initiation of ARV treatmentup to the last date of receiving treatment. They also showed an average increase in CD 4 count of 396. 63 cells/mm 3 (± 594. 53 cells/mm 3) and a very encouraging average decrease of 538369. 37 copies/mm 3 (± 948634. 46 copies/mm 3) in the viral <b>load.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aircraft}} loading {{problem is a}} real-world combinatorial optimisation problem highly constrained. Indeed, loading the aircraft so the gross weight {{is less than the}} maximum allowable is not enough. This weight must be distributed to keep the centre of gravity (CG) within specified limits. Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as floor loading, combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. Finally, some shipments are particularly restrictive to transport, like dangerous goods, live animals and perishable goods. This paper is concerned with the incorporation of these latter constraints in a mixed integer linear program for the problem of loading a set of Unit Loading Devices (ULDs) and bulk into an aircraft.

50|$|Wilhelm Peter Hubert Fick was {{the third}} child of cabinet maker Richard Fick of Massow, Pomerania, and Anna Kraft of Cologne, Germany. He was born in Cologne February 7, 1893.

Fascinated by art, music and architecture, Willy subscribed to the black-and-white periodical Licht und Schatten, collected sheet music and went to the impressive 1912 exhibition titled Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Kunstler. Willy Fick’s father was a staunch trade unionist, his young sister Angelika a budding socialist, and Willy dabbled with the anarchistic works of Mikhail Bakunin. The Fick music evenings where Willy played piano or violin with his siblings, often turned into heated political discussions.|$|R
