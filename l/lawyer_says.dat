2500|$|Mr. Renzi {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} {{and said that}} he intended to cooperate with the investigation. The search of the family business, he said in a statement, was [...] "the first step toward getting the truth out." [...] His <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> the cash payment he received was to settle an unrelated debt.|$|E
2500|$|Aramony {{consistently}} {{denied any}} wrongdoing. He appealed his convictions and sentences; {{nearly all of}} his appeals were denied. [...] "Aramony's <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> his client's judgment was impaired because of brain atrophy" [...] and noted [...] "that Aramony had a cancer that led to surgical castration" [...] while he was seeing Lori Villasor. Lori Villasor ended her affair with Aramony in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|... 14: Sokokurai and Hoshikaze {{are both}} {{fired by the}} Sumo Association, and {{make it clear that}} they will take legal action – an option which none of the other 23 wrestlers punished in the match-fixing scandal have chosen. [...] Sokokurai comments, [...] "I have never taken part in a fixed match in the eight years that I've been in sumo. I will prove this in court", while Hoshikaze says, [...] "I want to clearly prove in court that I didn't do it." [...] Hoshikaze's <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> his client was never given an {{opportunity}} to argue his case once he was found guilty.|$|E

2500|$|Ababio claims, [...] "The servile {{status of}} the trokosi {{is seen in the}} duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them {{connected}} or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them." [...] She then goes on to quote Article 7 of The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, which defines a slave as [...] "a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised". [...] Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian <b>lawyer,</b> <b>says</b> ritual servitude is [...] "slavery, pure and simple. [...] It violates every human right." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Abstinence" [...] — Kramer's face ages prematurely when {{he turns}} his {{apartment}} into a smoking lounge. Kramer consults with Jackie about filing suit against the tobacco companies for his disfigurement. Jackie describes Kramer's face as [...] "sallow, unattractive, disgusting." [...] When Kramer asks {{if he has a}} case, Jackie's reply is [...] "Your face is my case." [...] Jackie and Kramer then meet with a tobacco company lawyer, who alleges that Kramer's face gives him a sense of [...] "rugged masculinity." [...] Jackie replies, [...] "Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head." [...] After the <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> she will have an offer to settle out of court the next morning, Jackie tells Kramer, [...] "Jackie's cashing in on your wretched disfigurement." [...] Kramer settles the case without Jackie's knowledge for a Marlboro Man style billboard in Times Square featuring his own face. Jackie dubs this [...] "the most public yet of my many humiliations." ...|$|E
2500|$|All groups talk a {{particular}} language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It {{is the natural}} way {{of things that you}} say something one way which the <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> another way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, to what he calls the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of “the best society,” of “the fashionable”, of “the chic”, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity — T-manners and T-customs etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning [...] "U", he ends the article with [...] "T" [...] stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. However, T and non-T do not seem to have become popular though.|$|E

60|$|Strong language! and {{suggestive of}} {{something}} below the surface, {{in the shape}} of a romance. But I had my own object in view, and I declined (as we <b>lawyers</b> <b>say)</b> to pursue the question into its side issues.|$|R
60|$|Juanna {{took the}} letter and perused it twice, by which time she knew {{it as well as}} she did the Lord's Prayer, nor did she ever forget a single word of it. Then she handed it back to the <b>lawyer,</b> <b>saying</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Twelve hundred {{a year is}} {{all that}} he offers, and his <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> that he will make no {{stipulation}} whatever as to an allowance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{believe all}} Baslehurst pretty well {{is talking about}} it. If a man will go on with a lawsuit when his own <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> he oughtn't, what else can come to him but ruin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never didn't propose nothin'. I've axed two pound, and my <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> as how I'll get it. What I sold {{come off}} that other bit of ground down there. Wonderful crop! And this 'd've been the same. His Lordship ain't nothin' to me, Mr. Gotobed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--he will {{accompany}} me,--coming home {{of course}} for Parliament. It {{is a sad}} break-up, is it not? But the <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> that if I remain here I {{may be subject to}} very disagreeable attempts from Mr. Kennedy to force me to go back again. It is odd, is it not, that he should not understand how impossible it is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, I can't. That's {{the only}} thing that my wife 'as failed to fathom. There's somethink mysterious about it, I think, for Missis Hosten she won't speak to Marryhann on the subjec', an' all she knows about it is that the <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> there's an estate somewheres in furrin parts as needs lookin' arter. The lawyer didn't say that to Maryhann, sir, of course, but she's got a 'abit of hairin' 'er ears at key'oles an' over'ears things now an' then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is all a}} mistake, but I {{should not}} like it to get abroad. It would hurt my {{reputation}} a great deal. I shall settle the matter in the near future.

6000|$|... "Look {{you there}} now!" [...] said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. [...] "I thank the Lord {{he took my}} {{children}} to Himself, if that's all the law {{can do for the}} motherless.

It's well known there's always two sides, if no more; else who'd go to law, I should like to know? It's a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if it's no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he likes, but I say, don't Fletcher me!" ...|$|E

I prepare myself beforehand to regard it all as mere words, supplied at so much the thousand. I know he'll say whatever he thinks most likely to forward his own views. But upon my word he put it very strongly. He brought it all within so very short a space of time! Bonteen and Finn left the club within a minute of each other. Bonteen must have been {{at the top of the}} passage five minutes afterwards, and Phineas at that moment could not have been above two hundred yards from him. There can be no doubt of that." ...|$|E
60|$|January 19.--Wrote on by Mr. Laidlaw's assistance. Things go bobbishly enough; {{we have a}} {{good deal}} {{finished}} before dinner. Henry Scott comes to dine with me vis-à-vis, and we have a grand dish of politics. The friends of old Scotland want but a signal. A certain great <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> that if Sir W.S. wrote another Malachi it would set more men on fire than a dozen associations. This almost tempts me. But the canny lad says moreover that to appeal to national partiality, i.e. that you should call on Scotsmen to act like Scotsmen, is unfair, and he would be sorry it was known he, late and future placeman, should encourage such paw-paw doings. Yet if Sir W.S. could be got to stand forlorn hope, the legal gentleman would suggest, etc. etc. Suggest and be d--d. Sir W.S. knows when to [doff] his bonnet, and when to cock it {{in the face of all}} and sundry. Moreover, he will not be made a cat's-paw of, look you now.|$|E

25|$|Plaintiffs' <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Texas law {{prevents}} patients from getting compensation or damages {{even in cases}} where the patient clearly deserves it. In particular, the “willful and wanton” negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the harm is clearly negligent but not willful.|$|R
500|$|After Biden {{withdrew from}} the race, it was {{revealed}} that the Dukakis campaign had secretly made a video highlighting the Biden–Kinnock comparison and distributed it to news outlets. Later in 1987, the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility cleared Biden of the law school plagiarism charges regarding his standing as a <b>lawyer,</b> <b>saying</b> Biden had [...] "not violated any rules".|$|R
6000|$|After all my {{suffering}} {{upon this}} deeply interesting subject, here I am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely, {{out of the}} [...] "scrape"; and now I {{want to know if}} you can guess how I got out of it----out, clear, in every sense of the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don't believe you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the <b>lawyer</b> <b>says,</b> it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered my resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge, I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it again and again but with the same success, or rather with the same want of success.|$|E
6000|$|Nora had {{answered}} that proposition of her lover's {{to walk out}} of the house in Manchester Street, and get married at the next church, in a most discreet manner. She had declared that she would be true and firm, but that she did not wish to draw upon herself the displeasure of her father and mother. She did not, she said, look upon a clandestine marriage as a happy resource. But,--this she added {{at the end of a}} long and very sensible letter,--she intended to abide by her engagement, and she did not intend to go back to the Mandarins. She did not say what alternative she would choose in the event of her being unable to obtain her father's consent before his return. She did not suggest what was to become of her when Sir Marmaduke's leave of absence should be expired. But her statement that she would not go back to the islands was certainly made with more substantial vigour, though, perhaps, with less of reasoning, than any other of the propositions made in her letter. Then, in her postscript, she told him that they were all going to Italy. [...] "Papa and mamma think that we ought to follow poor Mr. Trevelyan. The <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> that nothing can be done while he is away with the boy. We are therefore all going to start to Florence. The journey is delightful. I will not say whose presence will be wanting to make it perfect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Alan," [...] wrote Barbara from The Court {{two days}} later, [...] "I have been {{thinking}} everything over, and since you are so set upon it, I suppose that you had better go. To me the whole adventure seems perfectly mad, {{but at the same}} time I believe in our luck, or rather in the Providence which watches over us, and I don't believe that you, or I either, will come to any harm. If you stop here, you will only eat your heart out and communication between us must become increasingly difficult. My uncle is furious with you, and since he discovered that we were talking over the telephone, to his own great inconvenience he has had the wires cut outside the house. That horrid letter of his to you saying that you had 'compromised' me in pursuance of a 'mercenary scheme' is all part and parcel of the same thing. How are you to stop here and submit to such insults? I went to see my friend the lawyer, and he tells me that of course we can marry if we like, but in that case my father's will, which he has consulted at Somerset House, is absolutely definite, and if I do so in opposition to my uncle's wishes, I must lose everything except £200 a year. Now I am no money-grubber, but I will not give my uncle the satisfaction of robbing me of my fortune, which may be useful to both of us by and by. The <b>lawyer</b> <b>says</b> also that he does not think that the Court of Chancery would interfere, having no power to do so as far as the will is concerned, and not being able to make a ward of a person like myself who is over age and has the protection of the common law of the country. So it seems to me that the only thing to do is to be patient, and wait until time unties the knot.|$|E
