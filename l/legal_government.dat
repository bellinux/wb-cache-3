25|$|Initial {{hopes for}} a unified, {{independent}} Korea quickly evaporated as {{the politics of the}} Cold War and opposition to the trusteeship plan from anti-communists resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate nations with diametrically opposed political, economic, and social systems.

25|$|The first motive of the war, {{presented}} by the Soviets, was to assist the Finnish working-class people against {{the tyranny of the}} White Finns.

The motive did not work as the Finnish working-class stood by its <b>legal</b> <b>government</b> in Helsinki. The Soviets abandoned this motive {{at the end of the}} December 1939.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{had ceased}} to {{recognize}} the Polish state {{at the start of}} the invasion. As a result, the two governments never officially declared war on each other. The Soviets therefore did not classify Polish military prisoners as prisoners of war but as rebels against the new <b>legal</b> <b>government</b> of Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia. The Soviets killed tens of thousands of Polish prisoners of war. Some, like General Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński, who was captured, interrogated and shot on 22 September, were executed during the campaign itself. On 24 September, the Soviets killed 42 staff and patients of a Polish military hospital in the village of Grabowiec, near Zamość. The Soviets also executed all the Polish officers they captured after the Battle of Szack, on 28 September. Over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the Katyn massacre.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, only in the brief period before the 1930s in the Soviet Union were Bahá'ís able to provide services based on their teachings. After that Soviet member states adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, so the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to <b>legal</b> <b>government,</b> abandoned its administration and properties. For example, in 1924 Bahá'ís in Turkistan had schools and a special committee for the advancement of women. All such developments were dissolved in the face of advances of policies on religion in the Soviet era.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Bahá'í Faith (Вера Бахаи) in Russia began soon after the {{founding}} in 1844 of the Bábí religion, viewed by Bahá'ís as the direct predecessor of the Bahá'í Faith, with Russian diplomats to Qajar Persia observing, reacting to, and sending updates about the Bábís. The woman later known as Táhirih, who {{played a central role}} in the religion of the Báb, was from an influential clerical family from Azerbaijan, which was then ruled by Russia. Russian diplomats later protected Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, before and after his exile from Persia. Around 1884, the religion began to spread into the Russian Empire, where the Bahá'í community in Ashgabat built the first Bahá'í House of Worship, elected one of the first Bahá'í local administrative institutions and became a center of scholarship. The Bahá'í Faith also attracted the attention of several Russian scholars and artists. During the Soviet period, Russia adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, leading the Russian Bahá'í community to abandon its administration and properties in accordance with its principle of obedience to <b>legal</b> <b>government,</b> though Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were nevertheless sent to prisons and camps or abroad. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union Bahá'ís in several cities were able to gather and organize as Perestroyka spread from Moscow through many Soviet republics. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the Russian Federations was ultimately formed in 1995. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated the number of Bahá'ís in Russia at about 18,990 in 2005.|$|E

Smith sat back and waited for them to finish, then responded {{that there was nothing}} stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks [...] "preferential franchise facilities", and they themselves had chosen to use [...] "unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the <b>legal</b> <b>government</b> of our country." [...] The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's [...] "terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for... murders and other atrocities". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a [...] "very small thing" [...] as immunity to the nationalist leaders.
