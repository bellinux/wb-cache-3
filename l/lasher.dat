The men had been mustering in an area where a man known as Paddy the <b>Lasher</b> had been murdered two years earlier, and once they had made camp and were sitting down to a meal several spears were thrown at them, hitting none of the men.

25|$|On November 2, 1923 (21 {{months after}} Taylor's murder) Gibson {{was arrested at}} her home at 2324 North Beachwood Drive, Los Angeles, California on federal felony charges {{involving}} an alleged nationwide blackmail and extortion ring. She was subsequently charged with extortion and violation of Section 145 of the Federal Criminal Code. George W. <b>Lasher</b> told authorities he had paid Gibson $1155 to avoid prosecution for a reputed violation of the Mann Act. Gibson was also said {{to be connected to}} two convicted blackmailers who had pleaded guilty the preceding week to extorting $10,000 from Ohio banker John L. Bushnell. Amid all the publicity following her arrest she was mentioned as both Margaret Gibson and Patricia Palmer. The charges were later dropped by the district attorney's office. Over the next six years she worked sporadically in bit parts and minor supporting roles but the industry's transition to sound film saw the end of Gibson's already thwarted career.|$|E

500|$|The first Venom title, , was {{published}} in January 1993 and written by Venom co-creator David Michelinie. The story began the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero and introduced the symbiote offspring (Scream, Phage, Riot, <b>Lasher</b> and Agony), who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 Carnage, U.S.A. limited series. Seventeen other series were printed between August 1993 and January 1998, including 1994's [...] (which continued the story of Venom's offspring and spawned the 1995 [...] "Planet of the Symbiotes" [...] cross-series story arc), 1996's Along Came a Spider (which introduced symbiote anti-hero Hybrid) and 1997's Venom: On Trial (which saw Eddie Brock tried for his crimes as Venom). Larry Hama wrote the most individual series (eight in total), including the 1997 final installment (Venom: The Finale, which saw the symbiote apparently killed). According to editor Tom Brevoort, the series was cancelled because [...] "The return on the book had declined {{to the point where}} any immediate financial reward was overshadowed by [...] discomfort with the character starring in his own title." [...] The limited-series run consisted of 60 issues.|$|E

2500|$|Basically bashing the book, <b>Lasher</b> {{argues that}} it is a gaudy bundle of fancy {{language}} with no true meaning. She says that it is simply a [...] "hodgepodge of language" [...] trying to cram too many concepts together with the only intention of impressing his audience with the extravagance of his diction and style. Though admitting that [...] "Kenney's linguistic acrobatics can be dazzling," [...] <b>Lasher</b> concludes to say that his overly self-consciousness causes his [...] "artificial style" [...] to be too distracting.|$|E

2500|$|Essentially Pettingell's review just {{summarizes}} the book, detailing {{the content of}} its four different sections, and lacking the negative criticism found in Lasher's review. However, this review argues that the book has a different goal than described by <b>Lasher.</b> Pettingell argues that the true goal of The Invention of the Zero is to question the validity of inventing and to explore the disparity that invention has caused between science and the humanities. What are the [...] "consequences of human ingenuity" [...] "Does every invention result in destruction?" [...] Has faith diminished because technology has flourished?
