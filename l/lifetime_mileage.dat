5000|$|All AERC rides are {{required}} to offer completion awards to all horse and rider teams who meet completion criteria (including the horse being judged [...] "fit to continue), as well placings and Best Condition awards. Individual rides may offer additional recognitions, including middle-of-the-pack awards and the turtle award (last place). Awards are typically low-cost and provide more sentimental than monetary value. T-shirts are popular awards. Moreover, AERC recognizes year-end accomplishments (such as top season mileage) and lifetime horse and rider mileage accomplishments. Various regional clubs and organizations offer further recognitions and awards. Widely acclaimed riders are typically those with high <b>lifetime</b> <b>mileage</b> accumulation and minimal [...] "pulls" [...] (non-completions).|$|E
5000|$|In 1971 {{and again}} in 1972, Smith rode a touring {{motorcycle}} from Iowa to Colombia through Central America with his wife, Josefina Martinez Smith, on the back. During these expeditions Smith {{was placed in a}} Nicaraguan Jail in Managua and narrowly escaped the near total demise of Managua by earthquake that December. During that same trip, Smith and Josefina barely escaped an exploration of the Irazu Volcano and were held at gunpoint in El Salvador until Josefina convinced the gunmen she and Smith were of no threat. These were some of many motorcycle travels taken throughout the world earning Smith an award for one of the Highest <b>Lifetime</b> <b>Mileage</b> on a motorcycle. Every trip an adventure and every adventure was off the beaten path.|$|E
5000|$|Hill did {{not miss}} {{a day of}} running between 20 December 1964 and 30 January 2017 - a total of 52 years and 39 days. Hill defined a [...] "run" [...] as {{completing}} a distance {{of at least one}} mile at any pace. His streak included workouts after a car crash in 1993 when Hill broke his sternum, and after bunion surgery, after which he used a crutch to cover one mile (1.6 km) in 27 minutes the next day. In December 2013, his streak entered its 50th year; his total logged <b>lifetime</b> <b>mileage</b> was at 158,628. At the end of April 2014 it stood at 159,106.5.On 20 December 2014, Hill completed Manchester's 5 km Heaton Park parkrun, achieving his goal of running at least a mile a day for 50 years.|$|E
30|$|The {{interpretation}} of this factor is rather difficult. It appears that the biggest problems with orientation are experienced by older drivers (low effect), women, those who have considerable lifetime driving experience, {{and those who are}} from a large city. The older driver predictor can be interpreted as a generally poorer sense of orientation and a longer reaction time on the part of older drivers. The <b>lifetime</b> <b>mileage</b> predictor can be interpreted rather easily – drivers who {{spend a lot of time}} on the road are more likely to get lost (greater exposure). Moreover, some items refer to driving on a motorway, which in itself is a predictor of a larger number of kilometres travelled. A similar interpretation can be made in relation to the big city drivers predictor, where the assumption of driving around a large city allows for a greater chance of getting lost or losing one’s orientation (exposure). The {{interpretation of}} the gender predictor (women) may be associated with Factor 2 (Dangerous Errors) and may be related to different driving styles in men and women. The education and occupation (student) predictors involve more complicated interpretations which require further research.|$|E
