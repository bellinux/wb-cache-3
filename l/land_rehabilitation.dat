25|$|In 1994, {{the mayor}} of Conteville in Normandy, André Dubreuil, noted that during <b>land</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> of the old quarry of Pierre de Caen, dinosaur bones had surfaced. He secured a partial skull and some ribs and {{notified}} the Paris Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. However, professional excavations only started in 1998 when the rock of the collapsed quarry face had already been spread by a bulldozer over a considerable surface. It proved necessary to dig up and sieve many cubic metres of rubble over several years, ultimately salvaging about two thousand bone fragments, varying in size between one and ten centimetres. From these scraps a more complete skeleton had to be reassembled.|$|E

2500|$|Suncor {{invested}} $1.2 {{billion in}} their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method [...] that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, {{commonly used in}} water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a [...] "beach" [...] with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would {{reduce the number of}} tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with <b>land</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the reporting periods from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology.|$|E
