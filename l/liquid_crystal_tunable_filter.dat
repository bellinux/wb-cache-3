40|$|A {{new type}} of Raman {{spectroscopy}} hyperspectral imager based on Bragg <b>tunable</b> <b>filter</b> has been developed by University of Montreal and Photon etc. Because the signal from Raman diffusion is much weaker than other optical characterization techniques, maximum efficiency is required from the imager. The standard methods, point-to-point measurements or imagers using <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>filters,</b> increase substantially the acquisition time because of the downtime of mechanical displacements of the sample or the low filter transmission and polarization sensitivity. The decision to use spectral rather than spatial scanning allows for saving in acquisition time while keeping high spatial and spectral resolutions. The technology of Bragg <b>tunable</b> <b>filter</b> has an efficiency of 90 %, allowing for non-destructive molecular analysis with high sensitivity. The transmission is continuously tunable over 400 nm with a spectral resolution of 0. 2 nm (down to 2 cm- 1).

In astronomy, continuing improvements in the sensitivity of telescopes and detectors have increased the number of objects available for study far beyond the capabilities of conventional spectroscopic systems to measure them. Instead of collecting spectra a single object at a time, research into multi-object spectroscopy solutions, the ability to examine many objects simultaneously, is the current focus in the field. This work tests the concept that an LCTF system could be of significant practical value to multi-object spectroscopy in astronomy.

The TFC {{is a new}} multispectral instrument with electronically tuned spectral filtering and low-light-level sensitivity.

The results of proof-of-concept testing, and characterization of two prototype cameras are included, along with a summary of the design analyses {{for the development of a}} multiple-channel system. A significant result of this effort was the creation of a system-level model, which was used to facilitate development and predict performance. It includes models for the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>filter</b> and intensified CCD. Such modeling was necessary in the design of the system and is useful for evaluation of the system in remote-sensing applications. Also presented are characterization data from component testing, which included quantitative results for linearity, signal to noise ratio (SNR), linearity, and radiometric response. These data were used to help refine and validate the model. For a pre-defined source, the spatial and spectral response, and the noise of the camera, system can now be predicted. The innovation that sets this development apart is the fact that this instrument has been designed for integrated, multi-channel operation for the express purpose of real-time detection/identification in low-light-level conditions. Many of the requirements for the TFC were derived from this mission. In order to provide background for the design requirements for the TFC development, the mission and principles of operation behind the multi-channel system will be reviewed. Given the combination of the flexibility, simplicity, and sensitivity, the TFC and its multiple-channel extension can play a significant role in the next generation of remote-sensing instruments...|$|E

40|$|Multi-spectral video {{endoscopy}} provides considerable {{potential for}} early stage cancer detection. Previous multi-spectral image acquisition systems were of limited use for endoscopy due to (i) the necessary spatial scanning of push-broom approaches or (ii) the impractical long switching times of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>filters.</b> Recent technological {{advances in the}} field of tuneable filters, in particular fast acousto-optical <b>tunable</b> <b>filters</b> (AOTF), make switching times below 1 ms feasible. Thus, AOTFs represent a suitable technology for the acquisition of hyper-spectral image and multi-spectral video data with excellent spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we propose a hyper-spectral imaging endoscope using a fast AOTF synchronized with a highly sensitive EMCCD camera for the detection of cancerous tissue. The setup demonstrates that the acquisition of hyper-spectral image and multi-spectral video data is feasible and enables the augmentation of endoscopic videos with overlays indicating cancerous tissue regions. Using hyper-spectral measurements from biopsies acquired with the setup in a clinical environment it is shown that the spectral characteristic of cancerous regions is tissue dependent. Even a sophisticated classifier such as a Support Vector Machines (SVM) or a Mixture of Gaussian Classifier (MOGC) cannot generalize the discriminative information if the training set contains measurements from different tissue types (e. g. larynx vs. parotid). In contrast, a training data selection scheme that chooses similar training sets for a given test set achieves a better prediction accuracy using an approach based on a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC) with the important advantage of improved robustness and less liability to overtraining. Combined with an image registration removing motion-based acquisition artefacts, the spectral information allows the augmentation of the video stream with overlays indicating cancerous tissue regions.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years there has been a {{significant}} volume of research work carried out in the field of multispectral image acquisition. The focus of most of these has been to facilitate a type of multispectral image acquisition systems that usually requires multiple subsequent shots (e. g. systems based on <b>filter</b> wheels, <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>filters,</b> or active lighting). Recently, an alternative approach for one-shot multispectral image acquisition has been proposed; based on an extension of the color filter array (CFA) standard to produce more than three channels. We can thus introduce the concept of multispectral color filter array (MCFA). But this field has not been much explored, particularly little focus has been given in developing systems which focuses on the reconstruction of scene spectral reflectance. In this paper, we have explored how the spatial arrangement of multispectral color filter array affects the acquisition accuracy with the construction of MCFAs of different sizes. We have simulated acquisitions of several spectral scenes using different number of filters/channels, and compared the results with those obtained by the conventional regular MCFA arrangement, evaluating the precision of the reconstructed scene spectral reflectance in terms of spectral RMS error, and colorimetric âµE*ab color differences. It has been found that the precision and the the quality of the reconstructed images are significantly influenced by the spatial arrangement of the MCFA and the effect will be more and more prominent with {{the increase in the number}} of channels.

40|$|Non-invasively {{characterizing the}} {{polarization}} properties of tissues has potential for in vivo clinical {{applications such as}} monitoring the healing state of wounds and burns. Conventional methods, which measure the polarization difference of a tissue and usually involve a co-polarized detection, are either restricted by a sample's surface reflections or can only be performed in off-axial systems {{with the use of}} matching fluid and a glass plate applied to the sample's surface. In this thesis a new technique called rotating orthogonal polarization imaging (ROPI) is presented. The technique involves illumination in a single polarization state and detection in the orthogonal polarization state in a coaxial system. Synchronously rotating both the illumination and orthogonal detection states can provide a polarization difference image that is free from surface reflections and sensitive to the polarization property of a target embedded within a scattering medium. The basic theoretical principle of the technique is demonstrated using Mueller calculus. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to simulate the ideal performance when detecting a polarizing target embedded in a scattering medium at different depths. Tissue phantom experiments also investigate the imaging of a polarizing target embedded within a scattering medium at different depths using manual rotation of polarisers and <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> <b>filters.</b> ROPI is far more effective than conventional polarization difference imaging due to the significant reduction in surface reflections. The technique is sensitive to polarizing targets embedded at depths of up to 17 mean free paths within the medium. Accurate quantification of dichroism is difficult due to scattering that occurs between the target and the exit surface of the medium. In addition, preliminary measurements of the linear dichroism of different real tissues (bovine tendon, lamb tendon, chicken breast and human skin) and a tissue engineered tendon orientated at two orthogonal directions are demonstrated. It {{should be noted that the}} majority of simulation and tissue phantom results that are presented in this thesis are for performing ROPI for polarizing targets embedded in a scattering solution. Much further work is required before the technique can be taken into clinical practice. Issues such as image alignment and the inversion of the data to produce clinically useful images still need to be addressed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Although cytologic {{evaluation}} of urine specimens {{is a standard}} procedure in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder carcinoma, its sensitivity and specificity are low. Cytopathologic diagnoses are driven primarily by spatial relations or morphology. Although color enhances the pathologistâs perception of the specimen, spectral information plays a minimal role in diagnostic processes. Recently, methods {{have been developed to}} capture and analyze spectral information from clinical specimens. In the current study, the authors determined the classification value of spectral information by testing its ability to discriminate between malignant and benign urothelial cells in cytology specimens. METHODS. Multiple images of benign urothelial cells (n = 39) and urothelial carcinoma cells (n = 35) were collected at serial wavelengths using a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>tunable</b> optical <b>filter</b> and composited into a mosaic using ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) software. Through minimum noise fractionation and principal component analysis, the spectral information in the mosaic was compressed into a 29 -dimensional scatter plot.

One area of spectral clustering in the scatter plot segmented with carcinoma cells exclusively (100 % specific), but was not present in every cell (approximately 50 %), which may indicate that these spectral profiles are present in a subpopulation of malignant cells or at specific points of their cell cycle. Using ENVI algorithms, the authors found that a particular classification spectrum (end member 9) and its closest relatives identified malignant cell clusters, with a sensitivity and specificity that reached 82 % and 81 %, respectively.
