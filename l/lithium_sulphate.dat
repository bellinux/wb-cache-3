Introduction. The investigation of NLO materials have gained predominant attention in current research owing to their applications in the technology of information transmission and processing. It is evident that the NLO crystals have exceptional technological requirements such as wide transparency range, fast response and high damage threshold. Due to such distinct optical properties, synthesis and growth of unique materials are in progress. The most widely used materials in photonic technologies are mainly inorganic crystals based on Borates and Phosphates. <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> Monohydrate Li 2 So 4 H 2 o (LSMH) is also one such inorganic highly NLO active materials [1 - 4]. The crystal structure and space group of <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> Monohydrate were originally determined as monoclinic point group P 21 by G. E. Ziegler (1934) [5]. A detailed study on the redetermination, further refinement and inclusion of hydrogen's position of Li 2 So 4 H 2 o structure were reported [6 - 8]. It is explored from the literature that the <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> Monohydrate has remarkable piezoelectric and electro-optic properties. <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> Monohydrate has highest pyroelectric effects among the non-ferroelectric polar crystals [9]. Earlier researches show that Lithium found to be effective NLO material on its combination with Selenate, Glycine and Bromide [10 - 12]. Since there is large demand for crystal in electronic industries, it is required to synthesize NLO material and to improve the properties of existing materials. Considering the facts, ethylene diamine tetra acetate and Cu II doped <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> Monohydrate single crystals have been synthesized and shown as promising candidate for optical second harmonic generation [13 - 14]. In the present work {{attempts have been made to}} enhance the physical properties of single crystals by incorporating bivalent metal dopant.

Therefore, we present the Synthesis of grown <b>Lithium</b> <b>Sulphate</b> monohydrate single crystals containing 0. 1 mole percentage of Zinc Sulphate by slow evaporation method.
