For each of these categories, we perform dynamic loan growth equations at the state-level augmented by the inclusion of CAMEL ratings for all banks in the state, after controlling for banking and economic conditions. We perform these regressions for two distinct sub-periods: (1) 1985 - 1993 (which covers the credit crunch period) and (2) 1994 - 2004 (which covers the sustained recovery period). For the first period, 1985 - 1993, we find {{that out of the}} three <b>loan</b> <b>categories</b> considered, business lending is the most sensitive to changes in CAMEL ratings (both the composite and the components), although the other <b>loan</b> <b>categories</b> also show some sensitivity.

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{are faced with}} the challenge to forecast future credit portfolio losses. It is common practice to focus on portfolio models consisting of a limited set of parameters, such as the probability of default, asset correlation, loss given default or exposure at default. A simple portfolio model is also used in the Basel II framework for calculating regulatory cap ital. With regard to the stability of the financial system, these models have to be approved by regulators who have an interest in a conservative assessment of the credit portfolio risk and require the stress-testing of risk estimates. The present paper is the first in its kind to develop a framework to stress the smallest build ing block, the sensitivities of risk drivers and therefore any derivative such as a risk parameter or the credit portfolio loss. As a result, estimation uncertainties as well as the correlations are taken into account.

We find that banks with formal actions shrink at a significantly faster rate than those without, even after controlling for differences in capital-to-asset ratios.

40|$|Abstract: A {{dramatic}} rise in subprime foreclosures {{over the}} past several years has led to calls for restrictions of, or prohibitions against, a range of lending practices loosely termed “predatory. ” Several cities and states have enacted legislation or regulations aimed at eliminating predatory practices, and some advocacy groups have endorsed action nationally. This working paper uses data from the Chicago metropolitan area to examine the impact of two frequently cited predatory lending practices, long prepayment penalty periods and balloon payments, on the probability of foreclosure on subprime refinance and home purchase mortgages. This paper also examines the impact of low- and no-documentation, and how combinations of low- and no-documentation, long prepayment penalty periods, and balloon payments affect foreclosure rates. Findings indicate that the impact of each of those loan features on the probability of foreclosure varies by <b>loan</b> <b>category,</b> meaning whether the loan is a refinance or a home purchase loan, and whether the loan is a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).

Allocations of the various loans (agriculture, cottage industry, trade and transport and others ¾ social credit) in the rural banks’ credit portfolio were significantly different among the four <b>loans</b> <b>categories</b> (ANOVA p = 9. 6 E- 29).

40|$|Using {{a number}} of {{theoretical}} considerations, we define distinct periods of anxiety for key economic agents {{that are involved in}} lending decisions; namely, consumers, CEOs, and banks. The main characteristic of anxious periods is that the perceptions and expectations about economic conditions worsen for these agents even though the economy is not in a recession. Subsequently, we study the lending behavior of US banks during the three distinct pools of anxious quarters from 1985 - 2010, using bank-level data. We find that banks’ lending falls when consumers and banks are anxious, and this effect is more pronounced when banks hold a high level of credit risk. Yet, in those anxious periods that were followed by recessions, the negative impact of anxiety on loan growth is significantly weaker for banks with high-credit risk that points to the existence of a moral-hazard mechanism. We also find significant differentiation in banks’ lending within anxious periods across different <b>loan</b> <b>categories.</b> We contend that these findings point to the identification of an ‘expectations channel’ in banks’ lending that exists throughout the business cycle. ...|$|E

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of gross credit flows, the paper studies the cyclical behavior of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net credit, gross flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, gross credit flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger than GDP volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit expansion. Furthermore, the behavior of gross flows over the 1991 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The results lends some support to aggregate models that emphasize the asymmetric behavior of credit expansion and credit contractions. Address...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if commercial banks systematically and prejudicially discriminated on the basis of sex in granting consumer loans prior to enactment of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). It uses data on 37, 000 paid-off and charged-off consumer loans at 30 banks in five regions of the country for the years 1965 - 71. The study tests the hypothesis that sex discrimination exists against the alternative (competitive market or profit-maximization) hypothesis that lenders will not systematically discriminate on the basis of sex because, to do so, they would have to turn away profitable business. It does so by analyzing the relative incidence with which loans made to males and females occur among "good " paid-off and charged-off loans over the sample period. Given that loan rates, loss rates, and servicing costs are assumed to be invariant with sex, if prejudicial sex discrimination exists, members of the sex discriminated against will have to be better than average credit risks in order to obtain credit. Thus, on average, such borrowers should not be represented as frequently among charged-off loans as they are among good paid off loans. If no prejudicial sex discrimination exists, members of each sex should be equiproportionately represented in the paid-off and charged-off <b>loan</b> <b>categories...</b>|$|E
40|$|The wave of bank {{failures}} {{during the late}} 1980 s was comparable in magnitude to the one witnessed during the Great Depression. The absence of any corresponding economic downturn during the recent crisis, however, initially created a certain mystery as to its causes. By 1990, a near-consensus had emerged {{to the effect that}} certain alleged flaws in the system of bank regulation were to blame, in particular the existence of flat-rate deposit insurance. The focus in the dissertation, by contrast, is on errors in strategic management collectively made by bankers during the years immediately prior to the banking crisis. Specifically, the thesis is that bankers mismanaged aggregate credit-risk by effecting expansionary lending policy precisely when such a policy was ill-advised. This, in turn, resulted in mass loan-default and bank failure during the late 1980 s. Analysis of bank-lending data and default patterns indicated that the mismanagement of aggregate credit-risk in this manner contributed overwhelmingly to the, recent banking crisis. The research which underlies the dissertation made intensive use of bankruptcy data generated in raw form by the U. S. Department of Justice. The dissertation presents a strategy for managing aggregate credit-risk more prudently, the focus of which is a methodology for forecasting bankruptcy rates across the economy and by <b>loan</b> <b>category.</b> Sound management of aggregate credit-risk by the banking sector both enhances bank profits and reduces the potential for the sort of harm to the general economy which is likely to follow from perverse credit policy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether in}} recent years banks have increased their holdings of securities {{at the expense of}} their holdings of business loans in response to shortfalls of their capital relative to risk-weighted capital standards and relative to a capital standard that made no explicit allowance for credit risk. We estimated that bank credit fell by about $ 4. 50 for each $ 1 that a bank's capital fell short of the unweighted capital standard. Banks that had less capital than required by the risk-weighted standard appear to have shifted away from assets with low risk weights (securities and single-family mortgages) and to have shifted toward assets with higher risk weights (commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans). When we included both shortfall variables in a regression, shortfalls relative to the unweighted capital standard significantly affected bank credit, while shortfalls of capital relative to the risk-weighted standard did not. We found no significant effects of capital shortfalls at other, local-competitor banks on bank portfolios. Delinquencies in a given category of a bank's loans generally had significantly negative effects on that bank's holdings of <b>loans</b> in that <b>category.</b> In contrast, banks tended to increase holdings of <b>loans</b> in <b>categories</b> in which local-competitor banks were experiencing higher delinquency rates.

40|$|U. S. {{commercial}} banks {{continued to be}} highly profitable in 2004. Return on assets and return on equity declined moderately, but the economy's continued expansion and supportive financial conditions helped keep bank profits in the elevated range that has prevailed since the mid- 1990 s. Profits were trimmed a bit by a narrowing of banks' net interest margins as the yield curve flattened and competition put pressure on loan spreads. In addition, gains in non-interest income were less pronounced than in 2003, and non-interest expenses increased. However, the continued improvement in the overall credit quality of business and household loans allowed banks to reduce their provisioning for loan and lease losses, and delinquency and charge-off rates for all <b>loan</b> <b>categories</b> trended down. Bank balance sheets also expanded. A robust housing sector and generally low interest rates supported residential mortgage lending, and increases in demand along with an easing of lending standards and terms throughout the year boosted commercial and industrial loans. Banks also reported easing their standards and terms on commercial real estate loans, and such loans increased despite soft conditions in some markets. Still-low interest rates supported the continued growth of core deposits, but the greater rise in bank assets required banks to rely more heavily on managed liabilities, which rose strongly last year.

NPL rate and loan yield are modeled {{as a function of}} individual loan portfolio composition. We choose four types of loan, that is commercial loans, consumer loans (including real estate loans), credit card loans and cash card loans comprising the bank's loan portfolio. In addition we use two types of bank's NPL, NPLs and OLs, which can represent the immidated NPL generated and the past NPL accumulated. We observe which bank in each of loan type with aggressive lending would have worse NPL rate. We also compare the NPL rate at banks belonging to financial holding company banks, pan-public banks and the other banks. Panel date analysis is employed in this study. The results show that in the bank's loan portfolio, the commercial loan influnces the most apparently the NPLs and OLs, and the NPL would worsen when its weight rise up. When consumer loan lending is made aggressively, it would make bank's NPL rate increasing. For the financial holding company banks and pan-public banks, they also maintain better NPL rates than other banks. 台灣銀行產業在持續走向開放化、國際化的過程中，面臨不少亂流。在經歷亞洲金融風暴後，台灣銀行產業先後在企業放款、消費性放款與近期的雙卡放款上蒙受損失，放款品質低落，連帶也使台灣銀行產業獲利因為大量打消呆帳而轉盈為虧。因此本研究藉由觀察銀行放款組合與總體放款品質的關係變化以了解台灣銀行產業放款品質受到哪些放款類型之影響，以對銀行後續在策略規劃與風險控管上有更進一步的幫助。 本研究的放款組合由 4 類放款構成，即企業放款、消費性放款、信用卡放款與現金卡放款，由於 4 種放款類型背後代表的授信對象放與款條件上不同，因此較能了解銀行在不同授信類型的承作對總體放款品質的影響。另外本研究也試圖觀察銀行是否會因為在 4 類放款市場的積極貸放行為而犧牲總體放款品質；另外金控銀行與泛公營銀行是否就能保持較佳的總體放款品質也是本研究另外兩個議題。 本研究以廣義逾放比與應觀察款項為觀察的兩類放款品質，以Panel data進行驗證；結果發現企業放款為影響銀行總體放款品質不佳之授信類型；而消費性放款則反應在積極承作銀行會有較差的放款品質。信用卡放款與現金卡放款在所有模型中均未明顯結果。另外金控銀行在觀察的期間內均保持較佳的放款品質；而泛公營銀行則在可能因承接過多政策性包袱而在總體放款品質呈現顯著邊緣的結果。第一章 序論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二節 研究問題與研究目的	 3 第三節 研究流程	 4 第二章 文獻探討	 5 第一節 銀行體系的不良債權	 5 第二節 授信類型、放款組合與放款品質之相關研究	 8 第三節 其他與放款品質相關之因素	 16 第三章 研究方法	 20 第一節 研究架構	 20 第二節 研究假說	 21 第三節 變數定義與實證模型	 24 第四節 研究分析方法	 29 第四章 研究結果	 35 第一節 敘述性統計結果	 35 第二節 研究結果	 38 第三節 實證結果討論	 46 第五章 研究結論	 53 第一節 結論與建議	 53 第二節 理論與實務意涵	 56 第三節 研究限制與未來研究建議	 57 參考文獻	 60 附錄	 6...|$|E

Analysts have been concerned about the behavior of bank credit during the nation’s recovery from the 1990 - 91 recession. At first, analysts worried the recovery would be hampered because banks were making too few loans and purchasing too many securities. More recently, loan growth has picked up and securities growth has slowed, a development some analysts view as a sign the economy is growing too fast to keep inflationary pressures in check. Bank credit growth may also {{shed light on the}} current and future state of the district economy. Trends in Tenth District bank credit may vary substantially, however, from trends in the nation as a whole. For example, district banks could be in better financial condition than banks nationwide, making district banks more willing to lend.
