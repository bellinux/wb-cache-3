60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the fire}} he saw that it was not many hours old and was {{surrounded}} by fresh boot and horse tracks in the dust. Piles of slender pine <b>logs,</b> <b>trimmed</b> flat on one side, were proof of somebody's intention to erect a cabin. In a rage he flung himself from the saddle. It was not many moments' work for him to push part of the fire under the fence, and part of it against the pile of logs. The pitch-pines went off like rockets, driving the thirsty cattle back.|$|R
40|$|ArticleA {{study of}} both fibre volume loss and related {{opportunity}} cost was performed across the South African softwood sawtimber industry to gain {{information on the}} actual utilisation of useful fibre and potential loss or gain of opportunity in terms of potential revenue from both field practices and policy. The study quantified volume losses from high stumps, felling and crosscut saw kerf, log allowances, excessive removal of merchantable wood, incorrect <b>log</b> <b>trimming</b> allocation, and utilisable wood left in-field. Eight treatments were examined: four terminated with merchandising at roadside landing and four at merchandising yards. Within the treatments, felling was either motor-manual or mechanised and compartments were classed by average compartment tree size (less than or greater than 1 m 3). Total wood utilisation {{was found to be}} 92. 07 %. Stumps were found to be 7 cm higher than necessary and volume losses because of high stumps were 0. 79 % and 0. 07 % for mechanical and motor-manual felling, respectively. For felling saw kerf losses, mechanical felling showed 0. 92 % loss, whereas motor-manual felling resulted in only 0. 15 % loss. Incorrect <b>log</b> <b>trimming</b> allowance provided for 0. 60 % loss. Excessive <b>trimming</b> of <b>logs</b> resulted in 2. 02 % loss. Volume lost because of crosscutting saw kerf was low at 0. 20 %, but tops not being extracted resulted in 2. 57 % loss. Using SIMSAW 6 simulations, these volume losses translated into an additional annual harvested volume of 421 722 m 3 or additional 1 278 ha harvested area, R 166 million log value and R 393 million net lumber value loss. Total loss was lowest (6. 49 %) in the average tree size class less than 1 m 3, which was mechanically felled regardless of merchandising location. For the majority of volume loss categories, motor-manual felling caused greater loss when compared to mechanical felling methods. <b>Log</b> <b>trimming</b> allowance consumed 80 604 m 3 annually. The results indicate that the human element may have a greater impact on fibre and value losses than the system choice. Further research is recommended to quantify the effect of the human element. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fault tolerance algorithm for a home-based lazy release consistency distributed shared memory (DSM) {{system based on}} volatile logging and independent checkpointing. The proposed approach targets large-scale distributed shared-memory computing on local-area clusters of computers as well as collaborative shared-memory applications on wide-area meta-clusters over the Internet. The challenge in building such systems lies in controlling {{the size of the}} logs and to garbage collect the unnecessary checkpoints in the absence of global coordination. In this paper we dene a set of rules for lazy <b>log</b> <b>trimming</b> (LLT) and checkpoint garbage collection (CGC) and prove that they do not aect the recoverability of the system. We have implemented our logging algorithm in a home-based DSM system and showed on three representative applications that our scheme eectively bounds the size of the logs and the number of checkpointed page versions kept in stable storage. 1 Int [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The patrol {{cabin is}} a one story log cabin {{on a log}} sill {{foundation}} using 14 in logs. The cabin is square in plan with asphalt roll roofing on the gabled roof. The door retains its original wrought iron hardware. The interior is floored with 8 in boards, cut to a length of 3 ft to fit a pack saddle. The interior <b>logs</b> are <b>trimmed</b> with split-pole chinking. The ceiling is open, with exposed log framing.|$|R
50|$|Bucking may {{be done in}} {{a variety}} of ways {{depending}} on the logging operation. Trees that have been previously felled and moved to a landing with a log skidder are spread out for processing. While many of the limbs have broken off during transport, the remaining limbs and stubs have to be trimmed. The bucker will anchor the end of an auto rewinding tape measure which is attached to his belt and walk down the <b>log</b> <b>trimming</b> as he goes. The tape is anchored gently with a bent horseshoe nail in the bark so it can be jerked loose when the measurement is completed. When a suitable place to buck the tree is located the cut is made. Local market conditions will determine the particular lengths cut. It is common for log buyers to issue purchase orders for the length, diameter, grade, and species that they prefer and will accept. On the West Coast common cuts on a large Pine or Fir tree is three 32's and a 10. There are often different prices for different items. The bucker is the one who turns a tree into logs, and to do his job properly must cut the tree for optimum value. Significant value may be lost by sub-optimal bucking.|$|R
40|$|AbstractÐIn this paper, {{we address}} the problem of garbage {{collection}} in a single-failure fault-tolerant home-based lazy release consistency (HLRC) distributed shared-memory (DSM) system based on independent checkpointing and logging. Our solution uses laziness in garbage collection and exploits consistency constraints of the HLRC memory model for low overhead and scalability. We prove safe bounds on the state that must be retained in the system to guarantee correct recovery after a failure. We devise two algorithms for garbage collection of checkpoints and logs, checkpoint garbage collection (CGC), and lazy <b>log</b> <b>trimming</b> (LLT). The proposed approach targets large-scale distributed shared-memory computing on local-area clusters of computers. In such systems, using global synchronization or extra communication for garbage collection is inefficient or simply impractical due to system scale and temporary disconnections in communication. The challenge lies in controlling the size of the logs and the number of checkpoints without global synchronization while tolerating transient disruptions in communication. Our garbage collection scheme is completely distributed, does not force processes to synchronize, does not add extra messages to the base DSM protocol, and uses only the available DSM protocol information. Evaluation results for real applications show that it effectively bounds the number of past checkpoints to be retained {{and the size of the}} logs in stable storage. Index TermsÐFault tolerance, distributed shared memory, checkpointing, log-based rollback recovery, garbage collection. ...|$|R

50|$|Structural beams: Use {{of large}} {{structural}} timbers for primary {{support of the}} roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large <b>trimmed</b> <b>logs,</b> are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.|$|R
60|$|TOWARD {{the close}} of the next day Jack Hare arrived at Seeping Springs. A pile of gray ashes marked the spot where the <b>trimmed</b> <b>logs</b> had lain. Round the pool ran a black circle hard packed into the ground by many hoofs. Even the board flume had been burned to a level with the glancing sheet of water. Hare was {{slipping}} Silvermane's bit to let him drink when he heard a halloo. Dave Naab galloped out of the cedars, and presently August Naab and his other sons appeared with a pack-train.|$|R
30|$|Each <b>log</b> {{included}} mill <b>trim</b> plus {{an additional}} length {{to allow for}} the cutting of discs. The discs, approximately 5  cm thick, were removed from the butt end of the bole, and from the top of each log, and processed for green weight and green volume, to derive a measure of wood density using the Archimedean immersion method. Mean wood density of each bole (and each tree) was calculated as the diameter-weighted mean of all discs from each tree, and mean wood density of each log was calculated as the diameter-weighted mean of the two log-end discs.|$|R
60|$|As {{the stream}} of logs came up into the mill the first log was shunted off the chain upon a carriage. Two men {{operated}} this carriage by levers, one to take the log up to the saw, {{and the other to}} run it back for another cut. The run back was very swift. Then a huge black iron head butted up from below and turned the log over as easily {{as if it had been}} a straw. This was what made the jar and crash. On the first cut the long strip of bark went to the left and up against five little circular saws. Then the five pieces slipped out of sight down chutes. When the <b>log</b> was <b>trimmed</b> a man stationed near the huge band-saw made signs to those on the carriage, and I saw that they got from him directions whether to cut the log into timbers, planks, or boards. The heavy timbers, after leaving the saw, went straight down the middle of the mill, the planks went to the right, the boards in another direction. Men and boys were everywhere, each with a lever in hand. There was not the slightest cessation of the work. And a log forty feet long and six feet thick, which had taken hundreds of years to grow, was cut up in just four minutes.|$|R

60|$|Harry {{found not}} only {{handsome}} and spacious apartments provided for him, but a groom in attendance {{waiting to be}} engaged by his honour, and a second valet, if he was inclined to hire one to wait upon Mr. Gumbo. Ere he had been many minutes in his rooms, emissaries from a London tailor and bootmaker waited him with the cards and compliments of their employers, Messrs. Regnier and Tull; the best articles in his modest wardrobe were laid out by Gumbo, and the finest linen with which his thrifty Virginian mother had provided him. Visions of the snow-surrounded home in his own country, of the crackling <b>logs</b> and the <b>trim</b> quiet ladies working by the fire, rose up before him. For {{the first time a}} little thought that the homely clothes were not quite smart enough, the home-worked linen not so fine as it might be, crossed the young man's mind. That he should be ashamed of anything belonging to him or to Castlewood! That was strange. The simple folks there were only too well satisfied with all things that were done, or said, or produced at Castlewood; and Madam Esmond, when she sent her son forth on his travels, thought no young nobleman need be better provided. The clothes might have fitted better and been of a later fashion, to be sure--but still the young fellow presented a comely figure enough when he issued from his apartments, his toilet over; and Gumbo calling a chair, marched beside it, until they reached the ordinary where the young gentleman was to dine.|$|R
5000|$|An {{article from}} 1879 quotes {{a letter from}} William Healey Dall, {{referring}} in passing to [...] "the white mens trading station at Plover Bay". It {{is not clear whether}} Dall meant an established trading post, or simply a rendezvous. As late as 1880, the only settlement mentioned by an anonymous visitor on the USC&GS schooner Yukon was a native village. [...] The Northeastern Siberian Company had a trading station, called Vladimir, on Plover Bay from at latest 1903 until about 1910. In 1908 the steamer Corwin unloaded cargo at Vladimir Station; this was the former revenue cutter that carried Muir in 1881. By 1913 Emma Harbor was the home of baron Kleist, the Russian administrator for Kamchatka uezd, of a district judge, and of an Estonian trader, Bally Thompson, who maintained a store there. Baron Kleists house, built of squared <b>logs</b> with curlicue <b>trim</b> cut from planks, stood on the eastern shore of the bay between two outbuildings. It was put up about 1909 {{at a cost of about}} $15,000, with materials brought up from Vladivostok. [...] In 1926, Yupik people from Provideniya Bay were recruited to settle Wrangel Island. In 1930, Provideniya Bay served as a temporary base for Soviet aircraft to evacuate passengers from the Soviet steamer Stavropol, frozen in off Mys Schmitda on the northern coast of Chukotka. These aircraft were delivered by the icebreaker Litke; the passengers, transported by aircraft and sledge, wintered at Provideniya Bay and were picked up by the Stavropol the next July. [...] Emma Harbor and Providence Bay were favored sites for scientific observers. These included investigators from the US Naval Observatory attempting to observe the 1869 solar eclipse, several ornithological collectors, geologists, and the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (geomagnetic observations) in 1921. The Harriman Alaska Expedition visited there in July 1899 and produced many good photographs illustrating topography and native life. John Muir noted that by 1899 there were around fifty Chukchis living in a dozen huts covered with walrus hide, already [...] "spoiled by the contact with civilization of the whaler seamen". John Burroughs noted that [...] "they were not shy of our cameras and freely admitted us to the greasy and smoky interiors of their dwellings" [...] and [...] "some of the natives showed a strain of European blood." ...|$|R
