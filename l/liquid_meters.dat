A VCV {{is implemented}} by sealing the venting channel/hole with wax plugs (for normally-closed valve), {{or to be}} sealed by wax (for normally-open valve), and is activated by localized heating on the CD surface. We demonstrate that the VCV provides the advantages of avoiding unnecessary heating of the sample/reagents in the diagnostic process, allowing for vacuum sealing of the CD, and clear separation of the paraffin wax from the sample/reagents in the microfluidic process.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an easy-to-implement passive liquid valve (PLV) for the {{microfluidic}} compact-disc (CD). This valve {{can be implemented}} by introducing venting chambers to control the air flow of the source and destination chambers. The PLV mechanism is based on equalizing the main forces acting on the microfluidic CD (i. e., the centrifugal and capillary forces) to control the burst frequency of the source chamber liquid. For {{a better understanding of}} the physics behind the proposed PLV, an analytical model is described. Moreover, three parameters that control the effectiveness of the proposed valve, i. e., the liquid height, liquid density, and venting chamber position with respect to the CD center, are tested experimentally. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed PLV valve, microfluidic liquid switching and <b>liquid</b> <b>metering</b> are performed. In addition, a Bradford assay is performed to measure the protein concentration and evaluated in comparison to the benchtop procedure. The result shows that the proposed valve can be implemented in any microfluidic process that requires simplicity and accuracy.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three different}} liquid valving methods for the centrifugal microfluidic platform, namely vacuum/compression wax valve, passive liquid valve (PLV), and check valve. The {{mechanism of the}} proposed valves is simply based on sequencing the liquid flow by controlling air-flow inside the microfluidic network. Specifically, the wax valve and passive liquid valve utilize a volume of trapped air in the source chamber or the destination chamber to control the burst frequency of the liquid. In contrast, the check valve controls {{the direction of the}} air to control the flow direction of the pumped liquid. Compared with the previously proposed valves, this mechanism prevents any direct contact between the valving materials and the sample/reagents. This will reduce the chance of sample/reagents contamination, and allow the use of wider range of valving materials. As a proof of concept, <b>liquid</b> <b>metering,</b> <b>liquid</b> switching, and liquid swapping are conducted using the proposed valving methods. Furthermore, Bradford assay for protein concentration detection, and enzyme linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for dengue are demonstrated to show the capability of the developed valves to perform biomedical applications. The results illustrate that the valves reduce the required spinning frequency to perform the microfluidic processes on the centrifugal platforms. In addition, the presence of physical barriers improves the ability of the developed valves to reduce vapour and contamination effect. Furthermore, the proposed valves show additional advantages such as the simplicity of fabrication and implementation, reversibility and multi-actuation, and compatibility with biomedical applications. Finally, the demonstration of the ELISA and the Bradford assays illustrate the ability of the presented valves to be integrated in any multistep biomedical and chemical application on the centrifugal microfluidic platform...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{separation}} {{is one of}} the most significant obstacles encountered during the development of analytical methods for water quality monitoring in spacecraft environments. Removing air bubbles from water samples prior to analysis is a routine task on earth; however, in the absence of gravity, this routine task becomes extremely difficult. This paper details the development and initial ground testing of <b>liquid</b> <b>metering</b> centrifuge sticks (LMCS), devices designed to collect and meter a known volume of bubble-free water in microgravity. The LMCS uses centrifugal force to eliminate entrapped air and reproducibly <b>meter</b> <b>liquid</b> sample volumes for analysis with Colorimetric Solid Phase Extraction (C-SPE). C-SPE is a sorption-spectrophotometric platform that is being developed as a potential spacecraft water quality monitoring system. C-SPE utilizes solid phase extraction membranes impregnated with analyte-specific colorimetric reagents to concentrate and complex target analytes in spacecraft water samples. The mass of analyte extracted from the water sample is determined using diffuse reflectance (DR) data collected from the membrane surface and an analyte-specific calibration curve. The analyte concentration can then be calculated from the mass of extracted analyte and the volume of the sample analyzed. Previous flight experiments conducted in microgravity conditions aboard the NASA KC- 135 aircraft demonstrated that the inability to collect and meter a known volume of water using a syringe was a limiting factor in the accuracy of C-SPE measurements. Herein, results obtained from ground based C-SPE experiments using ionic silver as a test analyte and either the LMCS or syringes for sample metering are compared to evaluate the performance of the LMCS. These results indicate very good agreement between the two sample metering methods and clearly illustrate the potential of utilizing centrifugal forces to achieve phase separation and metering of water samples in microgravity...|$|R

The method was developed on diaphragm gas meters, but {{can be applied to}} most mechanically-based flow meters. The proposed fingerprint method analyses the behaviour of the meter during a work cycle. The result from the analysis is a ''fingerprint'' of the meter, in which mechanical errors in the meter can be detected. This is explained by the mechanical connection between the sensing mechanism and the mechanical output from the meter. An error analysis of a diaphragm meter was carried out to deduce the type of errors that are likely to occur in such meters.

5000|$|Liquids {{are only}} very {{slightly}} compressible. This property of <b>liquids</b> lets <b>metering</b> pumps discharge <b>liquids</b> at high pressure.

Sometimes, a metering or similar pump has to be primed before operation, i. e. the pump head filled with the liquid to be pumped. When gas bubbles enter a pump head, the compression motion compresses the gas but has a hard time forcing it out of the pump head. The pump may stop pumping liquid with gas bubbles in the pump head even though mechanically the pump is going through the motions, repeatedly compressing and decompressing the bubbles.
