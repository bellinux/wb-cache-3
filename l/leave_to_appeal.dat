5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> in November 1986, {{arguing that}} the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, {{arguing that the}} trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC {{was granted}} special <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the High Court against the {{judgment}} of the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The Australian Government Solicitor acted for the ACCC, with Lindsay Foster as Senior Counsel; Blake Dawson and David Yates SC represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal. The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 2008 the Supreme Court granted Ngai Tahu Property Limited <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> hear an <b>appeal</b> of the Court of Appeal decision.|$|R
50|$|A {{request for}} <b>leave</b> for <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court was denied in January 2016.|$|R
2500|$|The House of Lords refused <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> {{hear the}} <b>appeal,</b> citing {{the reason that}} the case [...] "does not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance".|$|R
5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. That {{judgment}} ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} review began on 20 April 2007 and concluded on 14 December 2007. In the High Court decision Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy found {{in favour of}} South Dublin Co. Council and Shamrock Rovers. South Dublin County Council were correct in their 13 February 2006 vote {{to proceed with the}} stadium as originally planned. An application by Thomas Davis for <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> this decision to the Supreme court was refused by Judge Murphy on 25 January 2008. Building commenced on the stadium on 6 May 2008. Shamrock Rovers played their first 'home' game in over 20 years in the stadium in March 2009.|$|E
5|$|This {{process was}} {{temporarily}} halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims. Following a judicial {{decision by the}} Ontario Divisional Court on November 7, 2005, the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees. On November 22, 2005, the MTO {{announced that it would}} appeal the decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided. On February 24, 2006, the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> the 2005 decision. As a result, plate denial remains in place.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011 Mitchell was refused <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> {{take his}} <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, {{on the basis}} that his {{previous}} appeal had been dealt with before the Cadder ruling and could therefore not be re-opened.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{deals with}} civil and {{criminal}} appeals from matters heard in the High Court, and serious criminal charges from the District Court. Matters <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> the High Court from the District Court and certain tribunals {{can be taken to}} the Court of Appeal with leave, if a second appeal is warranted. The Court may also grant <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> hear <b>appeals</b> against pre-trial rulings in criminal cases, and appeals on questions of law from the Employment Court.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Privy Council had {{directed}} a trial at Dublin {{of the latest}} charges against Bingham, who complained about the partiality of Fenton and Norreys. The arrival of a new Lord Deputy, Lord Burgh, in May 1596 seemed to promise a fair hearing, but such were the shifts and feints in the preparatory proceedings that Bingham petitioned the Privy Council for trial before the full Dublin council or in England. In September, fearing assassination, he fled without <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> England <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> for justice and was put in the Fleet. He sent a petition to Burghley for his release, which was granted in November {{on account of his}} illness, although he did suffer a suspension from office.|$|R
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal.</b> She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of the}} Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
50|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a newly {{graduated}} Leningrad teacher, Yelena Kuzmina (played by Yelena Alexandrovna Kuzmina). She goes furniture shopping with her fiance, Petya, and in a fantasy sequence she imagines teaching a class of neat, obedient city schoolchildren. Instead, she is assigned to work in the Altai mountains of Siberia. Reluctant <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> she <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> remain in the city. Although her request is granted (by a faceless Nadezhda Krupskaya, seen only from behind), she is eventually spurred by the government's condemnation of 'cowards' such as her to accept the post.|$|R
25|$|Later {{cases that}} rely on Mt. Healthy have largely {{concerned}} the eponymous test derived from the case. The Supreme Court expanded its application to other ares of the law, for now <b>leaving</b> it <b>to</b> the <b>appeals</b> courts <b>to</b> wrestle with the specifics.|$|R
50|$|In June 2003, {{evidence}} {{was found that}} Ngo {{was a member of}} the W2K (Willing To Kill) gang, a group of prisoners willing to use any means to escape and he was transferred to the Goulburn Correctional Centre, a Supermax Prison. The High Court of Australia refused special <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> hear an <b>appeal</b> in May 2004.|$|R
5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act. Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa {{announced}} that lawyers acting {{on behalf of}} several opposition parties concerned about the credibility of the general election would approach the Electoral Court following the IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula's refusal to agree to their call for her resignation. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> the Electoral Court ruling.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

50|$|The Defendant {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in London papers that certain items, including brewing equipment and office furniture, {{would be placed}} up for auction over three days in Bury St. Edmunds. The Plaintiff obtained a commission to buy the office furniture and expended time and expense to travel to Bury St. Edmunds to bid for the office furniture. On the third day, the lots for the office furniture were withdrawn. The Plaintiff sued for loss of time and expense. The judge at first instance found in favour of the Plaintiff. <b>Leave</b> was given <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the High Court.|$|R
5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the bill could not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge in Equity McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that the mention did not exclude the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
25|$|Mr Shaik {{applied for}} <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, against his {{conviction}} and sentence, and consequential steps.

However, it granted <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> against the order for confiscation of his assets.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the failure}} to obtain {{certificates}} under s 74 of the Constitution, the NSW and Victorian commissioners of taxation sought <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Privy Council.

40|$|A {{family owned}} Mexican company, Zapata Hermanos Sucesores, S. A. ("Zapata"), sold {{approximately}} US 950, 000 worth of cookie tins {{over a period}} of four years to the Maurice Lenell Cooky Company ("Lenell"), an American company that produced baked goods. Lenell failed to pay Zapata for the cookie tins so Zapata sought legal advice and instituted legal proceedings against Lenell for breach of contract in the Federal District Court of Illinios. The cookie tin sale contracts were governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG"). Zapata succeeded in its Federal District Court claim and, as part of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s order, was awarded US 550, 000 as foreseeable loss under Article 74 of the CISG, being the amount of legal fees incurred by Zapata in bringing proceedings against Lenell. On <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Appellate Court, however, the award of legal fees was overturned. The parties now find themselves contesting a <b>leave</b> application <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court of the United States of America in a much anticipated debate over who should pay the lawyers...|$|R
25|$|The main {{planning}} process began in September 2008, but faced stiff legal opposition. Since Tesco pledged £21 {{million to the}} redevelopment, the stadium's planning application included {{a request for a}} new supermarket nearby. Trafford Council gave this joint proposal permission in March 2010 – a decision which was initially called in by the Communities Secretary for Judicial Review, before the go-ahead was given in September 2010. Derwent Holdings, a property development company denied permission to build a supermarket at the nearby White City retail park, then called for a Judicial Review. Although this was turned down by the High Court in March 2011, the case went to the Court of Appeal. Lancashire took the risky decision to begin work ahead of the matter being resolved, in order to qualify for grants from the North West Development Agency before it was wound up. However, the Court of Appeal ruled in Lancashire's favour in July 2011, and denied <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> further <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fourie and Bonthuys {{requested}} <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Constitutional Court, {{but this}} was denied and the High Court instead granted <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).

5000|$|Baisao's {{method of}} {{preparing}} tea {{was referred to}} as sencha, or [...] "simmered tea". In this method, whole tea leaves would be tossed into a pot of boiling water and simmered {{for a short period of}} time. This style of tea differed from matcha, the most common tea in Japan at the time, which consists of tea leaves ground into a fine powder. The method of brewing tea by grinding it into a powder and whisking it with hot water was popular in China in the Song dynasty, during which Zen Buddhist monks first brought the practice to Japan. By contrast, the Obaku school of Zen specialized in brewing loose leaf green tea, a style that had gradually become popular in China during the Ming dynasty. Sencha partisans of the time opposed the rigid, elaborate formalism of the traditional chanoyu tea ceremony, which uses matcha. The comparative simplicity of adding tea <b>leaves</b> <b>to</b> water <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> many Japanese monks and intellectuals (among them Baisao and much of his social circle) who admired the carefree attitude advocated by the ancient Chinese sages. Baisao himself saw tea as a path to spiritual enlightenment, a point he made repeatedly in his poetry.|$|R
50|$|After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Governor Bell signed Rogers's {{execution}} warrant and {{the execution}} {{was scheduled for}} December 8, 1905. Rogers inquired on December 7 whether the gallows were being erected, despite efforts having been made to muffle the construction noise. During the ten days between {{the signing of the}} warrant and her execution, Rogers ate and slept well, but she declined breakfast on the morning of her execution. Governor Bell granted <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> hear an <b>appeal</b> from Rogers's counsel at 8 a.m. on her scheduled execution day; however, he found no reason to commute her sentence. With no new evidence, he declined to stay the execution and Rogers was hanged at the Vermont State Prison later that day. She was pronounced dead at 1:17pm.|$|R
5000|$|Bishops {{arrived in}} Ephesus {{over a period}} of several weeks. While waiting for the other bishops to arrive, they engaged in {{informal}} discussions characterized as tending to [...] "exasperate rather than heal their differences". The metropolitan of Ephesus, Memnon, was already present with his 52 bishops. Nestorius and his 16 bishops were the first to arrive shortly after Easter. As archbishop of the imperial city of Constantinople, he traveled with a detachment of troops who were under the command of Count Candidian. McGuckin notes that the troops were not there to serve as Nestorius' bodyguard but to support Candidian in his role as the emperor's representative. However, McGuckin theorizes that Candidian's progressive abandonment of neutrality in favor of Nestorius may have created the perception that Candidian's troops were, in fact, there to support Nestorius. Candidian ordered all monks and lay strangers <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the city; he further instructed the bishops not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> on any pretext until the council was concluded. Several sources comment that the purpose of this injunction was to prevent bishops from <b>leaving</b> the council <b>to</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> the emperor directly.|$|R
