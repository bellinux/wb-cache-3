40|$|We {{analyze the}} way women's {{education}} influences {{the effect of}} children on their level of labor market involvement. We propose an econometric model that accounts for the endogeneity of labor market and fertility decisions, for the heterogeneity {{of the effects of}} children and their correlation with the fertility decisions, and for the correlation of sequential labor market decisions. We estimate the model using panel data from NLSY 79. Our results show that women with higher education work more before the birth of the first child, but children have <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on their level of labor market involvement. Differences across education levels are more pronounced with respect to full time employment than with respect to participation. Other things equal, higher wages reduce the effect of children on labor supply. Controlling for wages, women with higher education face <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> of children on labor supply, which suggest they are characterized by a combination of higher marginal product of time spent in the production of child quality and higher marginal product of time relative to the marginal product of other inputs into the production of child quality. female labor supply, education, endogenous fertility decisions, heterogeneous children effects, multinomial probit model, Gibbs sampler...|$|E

The results indicate that a child has a higher probability of working on farm {{if he or she}} is living with younger children, suggesting that older children are reducing resource constraints.

In this paper, we examine the role of international migration on the accumulation of human capital in Albania. We ask whether investment in human capital of children growing up in households with international migrants is higher compared with children in households without migrants.

We use Finnish worker-firm data merged with product-level trade data. We focus on Chinese imports and instrument them by changes in China's share of world exports to other EU countries. Both types of importing increase the job loss risk for all workers and, in particular, for workers in production occupations. An increase in import competition has <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> than an increase in offshoring.

Using event study methodology we find that affirmative U.

We also find evidence that tariff jumping in the form of new plants or plant expansion has significantly <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on U.

Interestingly, {{controlling for the}} full range of academic attainment and achievement generates even <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> for females – of 15 percent per quarter – than we found in Table  1, since their achievement measures are generally higher than those of males, while their earnings are lower. Controls for education and achievement also generate large (15 percent) returns for Hispanics relative to whites. And, for blacks and low-income students, estimated negative effects are now much smaller (6 to 12 percent per quarter) than we observed in Table  1, indicating that much (though not all) of their lower earnings is associated with lower academic attainment and achievement 27.|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of social}} network data is often {{hampered}} by non-response and missing data. Recent studies show the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> of missing actors and ties on the structural properties of social networks. This {{means that the}} results of social network analyses can be severely biased if missing ties were ignored and only complete cases were analyzed. To overcome the problems created by missing data, several treatment methods are proposed in the literature: model-based methods within the framework of exponential random graph models, and im- putation methods. In this paper we focus on the latter group of methods, and investigate the use of some simple imputation procedures to handle missing network data. The results of a simulation study show that ignoring the missing data can have <b>large</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on structural properties of the network. Missing data treatment based on simple imputation procedures, however, does also have <b>large</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> and simple imputations can only successfully correct for non-response in a few specific situations...|$|R

The average response to future changes in absolute and relative prices of the manufacturing industry in an OECD country depends on the mix of manufacturing industries, {{particularly with respect to}} energy intensity and substitution opportunities in production. We estimate short and long run demand elasticities using a shrinkage estimator, which allows heterogeneous demand responses across industries for each country. Our results show that price and output elasticities are heterogeneous within the same manufacturing sector across countries. Furthermore, an output contraction due to e. g. demand shocks will generally have <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on gas demand than increases in natural gas prices.

40|$|Using {{a simple}} framework, I reexamine the Hayashi and Prescott {{hypothesis}} (2006) that {{a barrier to}} labor mobility that maintained high agricultural employment was a cause of the stagnation in the prewar Japanese economy. I find that the labor misallocation between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors had <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on the prewar Japanese aggregate productivity than on the postwar aggregate productivity. However, this is not because the wage differential between the sectors was larger but because the agricultural nominal share was larger in prewar Japan. Finally, I show that a model that does not assume a barrier to labor mobility can explain {{the change in the}} prewar and postwar agricultural employment rate and nominal share. These results suggest that factors other than labor misallocation are responsible for the stagnation in the prewar Japanese economy. ...|$|E

30|$|Our basic finding {{implies that}} repeal of CLM {{encouraged}} couple formation.

One of our recommendations aimed at encouraging couple formation is for the remaining 11 states to repeal CLM. This may be especially beneficial in areas from which men migrate more than women, leaving populations with low sex ratios. We found <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> of CLM on in-couple residence of women without a college education and on that of men with a college education. As a result, the repeal of CLM has led to larger increases in couple formation by low educated women (relative to those with high education) and by high educated men (relative to those with a low education).|$|E

Examining the wage functions of blue collar natives and foreigners in a random effects panel model using a vast sample of micro data, we actually find that foreigners negatively affect the wages of Germans and themselves on the whole.

40|$|Abstract: Studies of {{the welfare}} {{implications}} of trade policy often do not {{take account of the}} potential for tariff-jumping FDI to mitigate positive gains to domestic producers. We use event study methodology to examine the market effects for U.

On average, affirmative U. S. AD decisions are associated with 3 % abnormal gains to a petitioning firm when there is no tariff-jumping FDI, but no abnormal gains if there is tariff-jumping FDI. The evidence for this mitigating effect is strongest when announcements of the intended tariff-jumping FDI have already occurred before an AD decision takes place, which happened in fair number of cases. We also find evidence that the announcements of plant expansions (and, to some extent, new plants) have significantly <b>larger</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on U.
