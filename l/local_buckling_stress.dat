40|$|Circular {{thin-walled}} elastic tubes under concentric {{axial loading}} usually fail by shell buckling, and in practical design procedures the buckling load {{can be determined}} by modifying the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> to account empirically for the imperfection sensitive response that is typical in Donnell shell theory. While the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> of a hollow thin-walled tube under concentric axial compression has a solution in closed form, that of a thin-walled circular tube with an elastic infill, which restrains the local buckling mode, has received far less attention. This paper addresses the local buckling of a tubular member subjected to axial compression, and formulates an energy-based technique for determining the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> {{as a function of}} the stiffness of the elastic infill by recourse to a transcendental equation. This simple energy formulation, with one degree of buckling freedom, shows that the elastic <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> increases from 1 to √ 3 times that of a hollow tube as the stiffness of the elastic infill increases from zero to infinity; the latter case being typical of that of a concrete-filled steel tube. The energy formulation is then recast into a multi-degree of freedom matrix stiffness format, in which the function for the buckling mode is a Fourier representation satisfying, a priori, the necessary kinematic condition that the buckling deformation vanishes at the point where it enters the elastic medium. The solution is shown to converge rapidly, and demonstrates that the simple transcendental formulation provides a sufficiently accurate representation of the buckling problem...|$|E

A total of three tests were carried out, composed of two composite walls with built-in steel plate, and one composite wall with two skins of steel plate. The gross dimensions of the three specimens were 1206 mm × 2006 mm × 300 mm. Experimental results show that the composite wall with two skins of steel plate has an optimal ability of elastic-plastic deformation, and the maximum axial compressive bearing capacity among the three specimens. Using the energy method, the critical <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of steel plate were calculated, and compared with the yield stresses. According to different confined actions of concrete, concrete constitutive models were proposed, and the axial compressive strengths of confined concrete were calculated. Considering the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> of steel plate and confined concrete, the calculation formula of the axial compression of the composite wall was put forward, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the test results.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the elastic {{buckling}} of longitudinally stiffened panels, for which overall and <b>local</b> plate <b>buckling</b> are two distinct failure modes.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{of the scientific community}} in obtaining the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> for pultruded FRP (PFRP) shapes is shown by the huge number of published studies on this subject. The main objective of the present paper is to provide accurate estimates of the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> moment for PFRP beams. These estimates are fundamental for defining the nondimensional slenderness parameter introduced by the Italian Design Guide CNR DT 205 / 2007 [1] for beams in pure bending. One of the most technically sound formulations is that proposed by Kollár [2], who derived explicit expressions for the critical normal stresses of flange and web panels of PFRP beams that depend on the rotational stiffness of the web-flange junction in compression. This formulation is based on a consolidated approach for estimating the flange buckling strength of typical steel profiles [3]. In the present paper, a literature review is initially reported. In particular, it is shown that the approximate expression for the critical stress provided in [3] for steel members tends to underestimate the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> strength, {{especially in the case of}} wide-flange cross-section profiles. This underestimation becomes particularly evident for PFRP beams. For example, in [4], on the basis of the results of 10 bending tests, an average ratio of 1. 2 between experimental and predicted <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> moments was obtained. Anyway, it has clearly been shown that the web-flange junctions play a crucial role in determining the buckling and ultimate strengths of PFRP beams [5]. Therefore, the experimental and numerical characterization of the junction behaviour is necessary [6]-[7]. The rotational spring stiffness used in Kollár’s model to reproduce the behaviour of the web-flange junction seems sensitive to the shear modulus of the flanges [4] and to the ratio Io,f/Io,w [8], with Io,f and Io,w being the ratios between transverse and longitudinal Young’s moduli for the web and flanges, respectively. Hence, in the present paper estimates of this stiffness based on a series of finite element buckling analysis results are finally reported. The influence of possible differences in the mechanical properties between flange and web panels is suitably taken into account...|$|R
40|$|A conceptually new {{structural}} design approach {{has recently been}} proposed by the authors to predict the resistance of stainless steel members subjected to various types of loading with cross-sections formed from thin flat plates including angles, channels, lipped channels, I-sections and rectangular hollow sections (RHS). The proposed method does not follow the traditional cross-section classification approach, which primarily relies on the assumption of a bilinear, elastic–perfectly-plastic material model. Instead, deformation capacity of a cross-section is determined directly from the local buckling characteristics of the constituent plate elements. This is then used to obtain the corresponding <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> utilising an appropriate material model. This basic concept is extended herein to predict compression resistance of stainless steel columns with circular hollow sections (CHS). Available test and finite element (FE) results {{have been used to}} develop the basic design equation to predict the compression resistance of cross-sections and to propose column curves to determine flexural buckling resistances. The predicted resistances have been compared to those obtained using the current Eurocode; the predictions are significantly more accurate and more consistent than those given by the existing Eurocode...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It was {{presented}} at the 48 th AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference [© AIAA]. The panel analysis and optimization code VICONOPT, based on exact strip theory, is utilized to investigate the optimum design of stiffened panels with multiple stiffener sizes or substiffeners. The optimization ensures that the buckling stability of the panel includes an allowance for postbuckling reserve of strength. The adoption of this approach necessarily results in the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> being lower than the overall buckling stress and with the introduction of substiffeners introduces extra buckling modes. This complicates the post buckling behavior of the panel which is investigated by examining the case when the smaller stiffeners lose stiffness, i. e. there is a change from a local to a torsional mode. The panels are loaded in axial compression with a sinusoidal imperfection. It is found that small mass savings are achieved by using stiffeners of more than one size and there is an increase in the spacing of the major stiffeners and transverse supports. The optimum panel designs obtained by VICONOPT are evaluated by comparison with the optimum designs produced with one size of stiffener...|$|E
40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally welded tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>stress.</b> For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally welded tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally welded tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally welded tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - ovalisation relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|E

The new expression for (EIx/Db) CO is also validated using the 55 FE models.

As part of the validation of the new beam-column method, ABAQUS elasto-plastic Riks ultimate strength analyses were made for 107 stiffened panels – the 55 crossover panels and 52 others. The beam-column and orthotropic approaches were also used. A surprising result was that the orthotropic approach has a large error for crossover panels whereas the beam-column method does not. Some possible reasons for this are suggested. Collapse patterns for the crossover panels are studied and classified from von Mises stress distribution at collapse.

Efforts {{have been made by}} several investigators to evaluate effects of residual stresses and strain hardening due to cold-forming. These results are still insufficient to establish stress-strain models for these sections that are accurate and general enough to evaluate the load-carrying and deformation capacities of the members. This paper presents results of a probabilistic analysis based on statistical data for mechanical properties of cold-formed circular tubes. The conclusions drawn are summarized as follows : (1) Stress-strain models for circular hollow sections after cold-forming, including effects of residual stresses and strain hardening, are represented by a Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain model using compressive yield stresses and ultimate tensile strengths measured by stub-column and tensile-coupon tests. A probabilistic analysis was carried out to obtain a probabilistic density function for one remaining variable in the model.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{investigation of the}} effect of a circular hole on the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression was carried out. The experimental program consisted of tests performed on seamless electroformed copper shells and Mylar shells with a lap joint seam. The copper shells were tested in a controlled displacement testing machine equipped with a noncontacting surface displacement measuring device. Three-dimensional surface plots obtained in this manner showed the changes in the displacement field over the entire shell, including the hole region, as the applied load was increased. The Mylar shells were tested in a controlled load testing machine and demonstrated the effect of increasing the hole radius on the buckling loads of the cylinder. The theoretical solution was based on a Rayleigh-Ritz approximation. The solution provided an upper bound for the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of the cylinders tested for hole radii less than ten per cent of the shell radii. The theoretical solution also identified the governing parameter of the problem as being related to the hole radius, the shell radius, and the shell thickness. The theoretical part of the investigation showed that even a small hole should significantly reduce the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of circular cylinders. Experimentally, {{it was found that the}} effect of a small hole is masked by the effects of initial deformations but, at larger hole radii, the reduction in <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> took the form predicted by the theory. The experimental results also showed that the character of the shell buckling was dependent on the hole size. For very small holes the shell buckled into the general collapse configuration and there was no apparent effect of the hole on the buckling mode of the shell. For slightly larger holes the shell still buckled into the general collapse configuration, but the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of the shell were sharply reduced as the hole size increased.

40|$|High {{strength}} steel provide designers {{with the}} possibility of creating more slender and weight efficient structures than would be possible if using steels with lower strength. To be able to do this, a structural designer needs updated and validated codes as aid in their work. This thesis addresses the behaviour of high strength steel with respect to <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> and residual <b>stresses.</b> The thesis was aiming to determine if there exists any significant differences in the resistance to <b>local</b> plate <b>buckling</b> of high strength steel (fy > 460 MPa) compared to steels with lower strength. Furthermore, longitudinal residual stresses induced by welding were also considered on a basis of material strength. Experimental work considering these two issues was conducted concerning the three steel grades Domex 420, Weldox 700 and Weldox 1100. The investigation concerning the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> resistance comprises experiments on 48 welded box section specimens made of the three grades. Nominal plate slenderness values were altered between 0, 7 and 1, 5. Moreover, the experimental work was founded on plate theory with respect to <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> and a survey of other conducted comparable experiments. The results from the tests and the literature survey were evaluated with respect to Eurocode 3. The gathered test results from literature and experiments showed that {{no significant difference between the}} <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> resistance of different steel strengths could be concluded if compared to the Winter function. However, the Winter function was concluded to overestimate the resistance for more slender simply supported plates (plate slenderness > 0, 9) with residual stresses (in as-welded condition). The residual stress state present in three box sectioned specimens made of the three grades was measured with the blind hole technique. Evaluation of the test results was made with respect to the steel strength and complemented with test results collected from a literature survey. The study showed that the tensile residual stresses induced by welding could not be directly correlated to the material strength.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the plastic buckling of Mindlin plates of polygonal plan shape and whose straight edges are simply supported. The plates are subjected to a uniform in-plane compressive stress. Two well-known competing theories of plasticity are considered here: the incremental theory of plasticity (with the Prandtl-Reuss constitutive relations) and the deformation theory of plasticity (with the Hencky constitutive relation). Based on an analogy approach, the plastic <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of such Mindlin plates are expressed in terms of their corresponding elastic <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of Kirchhoff (classical thin) plates, albeit in a transcendental form. Using this <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> relationship and the readily available elastic buckling solutions, one may deduce the plastic <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of the corresponding Mindlin plates. Tabulated herein are some <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> factors for various polygonal shaped plates with material properties defined by the Ramberg-Osgood relation...|$|R

The <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> of sandwiches increased when the rate increased from quasi-static to dynamic. The increased <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> were {{ascribed to the}} micro-inertial effects, which altered the buckling mode of the core from three plastic hinges to higher number of plastic hinge formations. The initial <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> was numerically shown to be imperfection sensitive when the imperfection size was comparable with the buckling length. The numerical <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of zig-zag and straight corrugated cores were similar, while higher inertial effects were found in triangular corrugated core...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> tests of light gauge cold-formed steel columns was {{conducted}} at ambient and elevated temperatures up to 700 oC to fully understand their <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> behaviour under fire conditions. Current design standards do not provide clear guidelines for cold-formed steel structural members under fire conditions. Although Eurocode 3 Part 1. 2 provides some guidelines for <b>local</b> <b>buckling,</b> other imposed limitations may lead to uneconomical designs. Some designers use the design guidelines developed for ambient temperature conditions to calculate the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> capacities at elevated temperatures by simply using the reduced mechanical properties.

40|$|In steel {{construction}} the methods to produce structural members include hot rolling, forming and welding hollow section (HSS) and welding plates to form I's (WWF). Another method, {{which is less}} widely known but is growing in acceptance, is cold-forming from steel sheet or strip using roll-forming machines, press and bending brakes, or folding operations. These cold-form steel sections have their own design codes. The use of cold-formed structures in building constructions goes back to about the 1850 s in both the United States and Great Britain but the formal design methods for these sections were developed only since 1940. Cold-formed sections add aspects to the design procedure which are neglected in codes for hot-rolled shapes, namely <b>local</b> and torsional <b>buckling.</b> The elements of a box or channel section formed from thin sheet may buckle locally, leading to collapse. To calculate the <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> the manufacturing process, makes the measurement of the width uncertain. Codes simply adopt the flat width. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a more accurate method to predict the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> for two major kinds of cold-formed section, namely an open section (channel) and a closed section (box). A theory has been developed to model the elastic <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> mode for box and channel sections. This is extended to predict the behavior of the section after buckling and up to the collapse. Comparisons are made with the results of the numeric analysis carried out using the finite element program ABAQUS, and with the code requirements...|$|R

According to the {{temperature}} changes of corrugated webs steel beam in fire at different time, 3 different kinds of shear buckling modes and the changes of elastic <b>buckling</b> critical <b>stress</b> of corrugated web steel beam are analyzed in the fire, considering the effect of fire high temperature on structure elasticity modulus. The computed expressions of partial shear elastic critical <b>buckling</b> <b>stress,</b> elastic critical <b>buckling</b> <b>stress</b> of general <b>buckling</b> mode and critical stress of elastic relevant buckling in the fire are presented in the paper.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> {{characteristics}} and the energy absorption of the expansion tubes with the various dimensions of tubes and punch shapes. The <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> load and absorbed energy during the tube flaring process were discussed for each cases of tube and punch shapes by finite element analysis. Absorbed energy of expansion tube {{is affected by the}} diameter and the wall thickness of tubes. Punch angle and expansion ratio also affect to the energy absorption. According to the <b>buckling</b> analysis, <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> can occurs in some cases. The absorbed energy of expansion tube significantly decreases when <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> occurs. For enhancement of energy absorption, it is important to predict <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> load accurately.
