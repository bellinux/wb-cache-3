25|$|Higher {{speeds and}} tighter turns require greater lean angles. If the mass is not first <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will {{cause them to}} {{continue}} {{in a straight line}} as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Express" [...] and Burlesque, Aguilera has {{performed}} the track on two shows. Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair with her back to the audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap her fingers and <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

50|$|If {{constant}} side {{forces were}} resisted by gyroscopic action alone, the gimbal would rotate quickly {{on to the}} stops, and the vehicle would topple.

60|$|The major {{put down}} his guide-book, Amy opened her eyes, and Helen removed her shawl from the {{opposite}} seat, as a young man, wrapped in a cloak, with a green shade over his eyes, and a general air of feebleness, got in and sank back {{with a sigh of}} weariness or pain. Evidently an invalid, for his face was thin and pale, his dark hair cropped short, and the ungloved hand attenuated and delicate as a woman's. A sidelong glance from under the deep shade seemed to satisfy him regarding his neighbors, and drawing his cloak about him with a slight shiver, he <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corner and seemed to forget that he was not alone.|$|E
60|$|And it came, {{from the}} north-west, {{a blast of}} wind, a blow, an {{atmospheric}} impact that bewildered and stunned and again made the Elsinore harp protest. It forced me down on the rail. I was like a windle-straw. As I faced this new abruptness of gale it drove the air back into my lungs, so that I suffocated and turned my head aside to breathe {{in the lee of}} the draught. The man at the wheel again listened to the Gabriel voice; and Mr. Pike, on the deck below, listened and repeated the will of the voice; and Captain West, in slender and stately balance, <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> face of the wind and slowly paced the deck.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness, {{watching}} the greater darkness of London below him. The chambers stood {{much higher than}} the other houses, commanding a hundred chimneys--crooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round, and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8-pieces. Northward the lights of Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square threw a copper-coloured glare above the black roofs, and southward by all the orderly lights of the Thames. A train rolled out across one of the railway bridges, and its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of the streets. The Nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly, [...] "That's the Paris night-mail. You can book from here to St. Petersburg if you choose." ...|$|E

Reviewing a recent performance for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Barton categorized Gutbucket's sound as [...] "a jagged yet fertile seam between jazz and rock highlighted by on-a-dime twists in tempo, time signatures and mood—often within the same song." ...|$|E

During the shooting, Purdey jumped out of the car to escape, and Waldorf attempted to follow him, even though he had already been hit several times, and ended up slumped across the driver's seat. Detective Constable John Jardine then fired twice at Waldorf through the open driver's door. Finch, meanwhile, had made his way round to the driver's side, where he <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car, aimed his revolver between Waldorf's eyes and said, [...] "OK, cocksucker," [...] before pulling the trigger, but the gun did not fire.

5000|$|De Gaulle {{stepped out}} onto the balcony to give a short address to the {{assembled}} masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the liberation from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words [...] "Vive Montréal! Vive le Québec!" [...] ("Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!"), but he then added, [...] "Vive le Québec libre! Vive, vive, vive le Canada français! Et vive la France!" [...] ("Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!"), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, [...] "Vive le Québec libre!". De Gaulle particularly emphasized {{the use of the word}} 'libre', as he <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.|$|E
5000|$|On a given sail, the net {{aerodynamic}} {{force on the}} sail is located approximately at the maximum draught intersecting the camber of the sail and passing through a plane intersecting the centre of effort, normal to the leading edge (luff), roughly perpendicular to the chord of the sail (a straight line between the leading edge (luff)and the trailing edge (leech)). Net {{aerodynamic force}} {{with respect to the}} air stream is usually considered in reference to the direction of the apparent wind (VA) over the surface plane (ocean, land or ice) and is decomposed into lift (L), perpendicular with VA, and drag (D), in line with VA. For windsurfers, lift component vertical to the surface plane is important, because in strong winds windsurfer sails are <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wind to create a vertical lifting component ( [...] FVERT) that reduces drag on the board (hull) through the water. Note that FVERT acts downwards for boats heeling away from the wind, but is negligible under normal conditions.|$|E

[...] "Tears filled her eyes as she paused for what seemed like a decade, then <b>leaned</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> microphone and said that yes, she did believe that they were involved." [...] Had she answered differently, Dubin believes, it would still have been a Perry Mason moment, but one [...] "that could have cost me the whole trial."

50|$|When {{travelling}} in a curve, {{the tires}} provide the centripetal force {{needed for the}} acceleration towards {{the center of the}} curve. The capsizing moment provided by <b>the</b> motorcycle's <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corner is in moment equilibrium with the centripetal forces at the ground when all is working correctly. If, having reached a given lean angle, the centripetal forces are reduced then the motorcycle increases its angle of lean until it touches the road surface, usually unseating the rider in the process.|$|R
