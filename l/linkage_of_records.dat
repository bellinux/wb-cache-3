DESIGN [...] The study involved <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> hospital <b>records</b> which specified that death occurred in hospital to corresponding death certificates; and <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> death certificates which specified that death occurred in hospital to corresponding hospital records. SETTING [...] Six health districts in southern England covered by medical record linkage.

Conversely, however, only 94. 4 % of death certificates which specified that death occurred in hospital could be linked to the abstracts of corresponding hospital inpatient records.

METHODS: Data {{were based on a}} <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> from a 20 % sample of the 1983 census to records of deaths occurring before the end of 1992. The study population included 72, 527 men, and the number of deaths was 17, 378. RESULTS: Differentials is mortality by origin show that mortality was higher among individuals of North African origin than among those of Asian and European origin. After allowance for several socioeconomic indicators, the excess mortality among North African Jews was eliminated. Substantial and consistent differences in mortality were found according to education, occupation, income, possession of a car, housing, and household amenities. Differentials among the elderly were markedly narrower than those among men younger than 70 years.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a secure protocol for linking data from different registries and to allow on-going monitoring of HPV vaccine effectiveness. A secure linking protocol, using commutative hash functions and secure multi-party computation techniques was developed. This protocol allows for the exact matching <b>of</b> <b>records</b> among registries and the computation of statistics on the linked data while meeting five practical requirements to ensure patient confidentiality and privacy. The statistics considered were: odds ratio and its confidence interval, chi-square test, and relative risk and its confidence interval. Additional statistics on contingency tables, such as other measures of association, can be added using the same principles presented. The computation time performance of this protocol was evaluated. The protocol has acceptable computation time and scales linearly with the size of the data set and the size of the contingency table. The worse case computation time for up to 100, 000 patients returned by each query and a 16 cell contingency table is less than 4 hours for basic statistics, and the best case is under 3 hours. A computationally practical protocol for the secure linking of data from multiple registries has been demonstrated in the context of HPV vaccine initiative impact assessment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{results of}} {{concurrent}} <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> {{from the same}} occupational cohort to cancer registries at both a State and national level. Methodological issues affecting the record registry linkage process will be explored in cases of discordant results between the State and national cancer linkages. METHODS: The number of incident invasive cancers in an occupational cohort of more than 11, 000 workers was determined by linkage to the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House (NCSCH) in 2003. The results were then compared with linkages by the cancer registries of Victoria and Western Australia in 2004, and also with a previous NCSCH linkage in 1998. RESULTS: Our analyses show an under-ascertainment of confirmed cancer cases by the NCSCH of about 13 % (26 / 205) in Victoria and 11 % (32 / 297) in Western Australia. In addition, 14 cases (5 %) identified in a previous NCSCH record linkage in 1998 were not matched in 2003. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly indicate that record linkage to the State cancer registries was essential to maximise the ascertainment of cancer cases in our cohort. We attribute the discordant linkage results to differences {{in the quality of}} the record linkage process by the cancer registries.

This paper documents the strategies employed to improve the linking between database records. Both explicit and implicit criteria were employed in record linkage. Explicit criteria were those based on linking between the contents of records. Implicit criteria were those based on the relationship between groups of records. Implicit criteria were found to be a very useful means of linking records, as well as a powerful tool for locating errors containing anomalies (data integrity). Analysis of the linking process demonstrates that using implicit criteria can improve the <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> Use of such criteria also enables questions to be addressed of the data about the hidden relationships that went into forming the source information.

DESIGN [...] A case-control study, nested within a cohort study, {{based on the}} <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> of subjects aged 40 - 83 from a health survey with those from the national Finnish hospital discharge register. SUBJECTS [...] 47 patients admitted to ophthalmological wards for senile cataract over 15 years and two controls per patient individually matched for sex, age, and municipality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Concentration of serum micronutrients, development of cataract according to whether operation was performed. RESULTS [...] Low serum concentrations of antioxidant vitamins predicted the development of senile cataract, the odds ratio between the lowest third and the two higher thirds {{of the distribution of}} serum concentrations of alpha tocopherol and beta carotene being 1. 9 (95 % confidence interval 0. 9 to 4. 1) and 1. 7 (0. 8 to 3. 8), respectively. Patients with both alpha tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the lowest third had an odds ratio of 2. 6 (1. 0 to 6. 8) of cataract compared with subjects in the top two thirds. The associations were strengthened by adjustment for potential confounding factors such as occupation, smoking, blood pressure, serum cholesterol concentration, body mass index, and diabetes. No association was found between the serum concentrations of selenium, retinol, and retinol binding protein and the risk of cataract. CONCLUSIONS [...] Low serum concentrations of the antioxidant vitamins alpha tocopherol and beta carotene are risk factors for end stage senile cataract.

40|$|Background: {{evaluation}} of the ‘Keep Well At Home’ (KWAH) Project in West London indicated that a programme of screening persons aged 75 and over had not reduced rates of emergency attendances and admissions to hospital. However, coverage of the target population was incomplete. The present analysis addresses ‘efficacy’—whether individuals who completed the screening protocol as intended did subsequently use Accident & Emergency (A&E) services less often. Methods: the target population was divided into five groups, depending on whether an individual had completed none, one or both phases of screening, and whether deviations from the protocol related to incomplete coverage or refusal to participate further. We ascertained use of emergency services before screening and for up to 3 years afterwards by <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> from KWAH to those of local A&E Departments. Patterns of emergency care were examined as crude rates and, via proportional hazards models, after adjustment for available confounders. Results: {{there was an increase}} of 51 % (95 % CI 22 – 86 %) in the crude rate of emergency admissions in the year after firstphase screening compared with the 12 months before assessment. This was most obvious in individuals deemed at high risk who also underwent the second-phase assessment (adjusted hazard ratio relative to individuals not ‘at risk’ = 2. 33; 95 % CI 1. 59 – 3. 42). Conclusions: the available data do not allow us to distinguish between several possible explanations for the paradoxical increase in use of emergency services. However, what seem to be sensible policies do not necessarily have their intended effects when implemented in practice. Lesley Walker, Konrad Jamrozik, David Wingfield, Guy Lawle...|$|E

Therefore it must be examined, whether this leads to a selective sample, and eventually to biased results when using linked data. In this report selectivity bias due to the linkage of the panel 'Labour Market and Social Policy' with administrative data from the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigated. The results show a low selectivity of the sample due to the response to the question of the content to link BA register data. The selectivity due to the realized merges is limited primarily to groups of people without any information stored in the BA register data. To verify whether the research results will be affected if solely individuals are included in the analysis that agree to the linkage, and subsequently can actually be linked, a regression with the logarithm of gross hourly wage as the dependent variable is performed. In this case, no significant differences could be found between the regression coefficients of a full and a reduced model, which would indicate a bias of the data.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The authors devised an {{experimental}} marking tool using Microsoft Access. Its features were assessed together {{with those of}} commonly available marking software and systems that had been identified by a survey of web and other sources. The marking tools identified, consisting mostly of software designed {{for the needs of}} US High Schools, could be categorised by their features. The categories included the ability to calculate and record marks; provide statistical feedback to staff; provide standard written comments to students; and receive work and/or transmit feedback over a computer network. None of these products had the intuitive feel the authors were seeking, and so we propose a model of an ideal Integrated Marking Tool (IMT). The IMT would allow lecturers to mark work using an electronic pen, replicating their current paper-based approach. It would also provide scores for named assessment categories; calculate marks; provide statistical analysis and provide written feedback to students (collated from an editable bank of comments that would build as the number of similar pieces of work passed through assessment). A full report of the above would be printed or transmitted over a computer network for the student and for the central university system. Issues of plagiarism in written work would also be addressed. The model is extended to cover wider networking potential and appropriateness, including the possible network delivery of elements of the IMT, especially the comments database, and the <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> <b>recorded</b> results to the student records, where they might be shared with other authorised staff. This paper sets out these criteria, and includes comparisons with commercial examples such as Mindtrail, presenting an opportunity for the delegates to discuss the merits of the IMT model and comment on their own experiences with such products...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{examine the}} effect of time on suicide after {{bereavement}} among widowed persons. METHOD: The data were extracted from Swiss mortality statistics for the period 1987 - 2005. The time between bereavement and subsequent death, specifically by suicide, was determined by <b>linkage</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>records</b> <b>of</b> married persons. The suicide rates and the standardized mortality ratios in the first week/month/year of widowhood were calculated based on person-year calculations. RESULTS: The annualized suicide rates in widowed persons were highest in the first week after bereavement: 941 males and 207 females per 100, 000. The corresponding standardized mortality ratios were approximately 34 and 19 respectively. In the first month(s) after bereavement, the rates and the ratios decreased, first rapidly, then gradually. Except in older widows, they did not reach the baseline levels during the first year after bereavement. CONCLUSIONS: The suicide risk of widowed persons is increased in the days, weeks and months after bereavement. Widowed persons are a clear-cut risk group under the aegis of undertakers, priests and general practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dementia is {{a leading}} cause of death among older adults, but less is known about the {{mortality}} risk associated with milder forms of cognitive impairment. Objective: To determine whether cognitive impairment is indepen-dently associated with increased long-term mortality in primary care patients aged 60 years and older. Design: <b>Linkage</b> <b>of</b> electronic health <b>records</b> from a cohort re-cruited between January 1991 and May 1993 with data from the National Death Index through 31 December 2006. Setting: A public safety-net hospital and its community health centers. Patients: 3957 older adults aged 60 to 102 years who were screened at scheduled primary care appointments. Measurements: At baseline, patients were screened for cognitive impairment by using the Short Portable Mental Status Question...|$|R
