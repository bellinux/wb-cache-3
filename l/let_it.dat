5|$|In 2003, <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main {{differences}} with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E

5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then <b>let</b> <b>it</b> tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E
5|$|Edward, the Black Prince became Duke of Cornwall in 1337 and he {{acquired}} Lydford Castle on Margaret's death in 1342.

Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead, to be used on castles in Cornwall. The castle well was possibly dug during the 15th century. After 1425, the Crown <b>let</b> <b>it</b> to a range of individuals, including Sir Walter Hungerford and Sir Philip Courteney.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Bleed — made a return to touring problematic.
