5|$|A 1999 DEIS only {{proposed}} new subway service from 63rd Street north up Second Avenue to 125th Street via the Broadway Line to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> with local and express tracks being {{switched on the}} Broadway Line. Second Avenue express trains would run to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> via the Montague Street Tunnel and local trains would run via the Manhattan Bridge and skip <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> A spur to Grand Central Terminal was considered, but later dropped due to its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|Before the AirTrain was completed, {{there were}} already plans to extend it to Manhattan. Between September 2003 and April 2004, the <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Development Corporation, the MTA, the Port Authority, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation {{conducted}} a feasibility study on the Lower Manhattan–Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project. This project would use the LIRR's Atlantic Branch to Downtown Brooklyn and a tunnel to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> This would provide faster service to JFK via a one-seat ride and LIRR service to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> via a transfer at Jamaica (i.e. the same plan proposed by the RPA in 1999). Under this proposal, baggage could be checked in Manhattan and transferred directly to planes at the airport. The study examined several alternatives, including using the existing Cranberry Street Tunnel or Montague Street Tunnel under the East River, or building an entirely new cross-river tunnel. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created.|$|E
5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new draft statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street to provide access to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{allocated}} $22 million to renew {{planning and design}} efforts for the Second Avenue line, but in 1993 the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan's East Side. The study analyzed several alternatives, such as improvements to the Lexington Avenue Line to increase capacity, enhanced bus service with dedicated lanes, and light rail or ferry service on the East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. In November 1997, the MTA initiated the <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Access Study (LMA) to improve access to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> from the New York City suburbs. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to <b>Lower</b> <b>Manhattan</b> {{was one of the}} five build alternatives developed by the study.|$|E
