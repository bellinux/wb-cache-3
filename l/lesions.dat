Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo <b>lesions</b> is poor.|$|E

5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzler–Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger <b>lesions</b> that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade <b>lesions</b> (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small <b>lesions</b> that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable <b>lesions</b> (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness <b>lesions</b> (stageIII and IV) or <b>lesions</b> of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These <b>lesions</b> offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: WM <b>lesion</b> {{segmentation}} {{is often}} {{performed with the}} use of subjective rating scales because manual methods are laborious and tedious; however, automated methods are now available. We compared the performance of total <b>lesion</b> volume grading computed by use of an automated WM <b>lesion</b> segmentation algorithm with that of subjective rating scales and expert manual segmentation in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Structural T 1 and FLAIR MR imaging data from 50 subjects with diabetes (age, 67. 7 7. 2 years) and 50 nondiabetic sibling pairs (age, 67. 5 9. 4 years) were evaluated in an institutional review board–approved study. WM <b>lesion</b> segmentation maps and total <b>lesion</b> volumewere generated for each subject bymeans of the Statistical ParametricMapping (SPM 8) <b>Lesion</b> Segmentation Toolbox. Subjective WM <b>lesion</b> grade was determined by means of a 0 – 9 rating scale by 2 readers. Ground-truth total <b>lesion</b> volume was determined by means of manual segmentation by experienced readers. Correlation analyses compared manual segmentation total <b>lesion</b> volume with automated and subjective evaluation methods. RESULTS: Correlation between average <b>lesion</b> segmentation and ground-truth total <b>lesion</b> volume was 0. 84. Maximum correlation be-tween the <b>Lesion</b> Segmentation Toolbox and ground-truth total <b>lesion</b> volume (0. 87) occurred at the segmentation threshold of k 0. 25, whereas maximum correlation between subjective <b>lesion</b> segmentation and the <b>Lesion</b> Segmentation Toolbox (0. 73) occurred at k 0. 15.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} <b>lesions</b> in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. <b>Lesions</b> {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of <b>lesions</b> in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the <b>lesions</b> with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{fatty acid}} profile is {{associated}} with the risk and progression of several diseases, probably via mechanisms including its influence on gene expression. We previously reported a correlation between ECHDC 3 upregulation and the severity of acute coronary syndrome. Here, we assessed the relationship of serum fatty acid profile and ECHDC 3 expression with the extent of coronary <b>lesion.</b> Methods Fifty-nine individuals aged 30 to 74  years and undergoing elective cinecoronariography for the first time were enrolled in the present study. The extent of coronary <b>lesion</b> was assessed by the Friesinger index and patients were classified as without <b>lesion</b> (n[*]=[*] 18), low <b>lesion</b> (n[*]=[*] 17), intermediate <b>lesion</b> (n[*]=[*] 17) and major <b>lesion</b> (n[*]=[*] 7). Serum biochemistry, fatty acid concentration, and ECHDC 3 mRNA expression in blood were evaluated. Results Elevated serum levels of oleic acid and total monounsaturated fatty acids were observed in patients with low and intermediate <b>lesion,</b> when compared to patients without <b>lesion</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). ECHDC 3 mRNA expression was 1. 2 fold higher in patients with low <b>lesion</b> than in patients without <b>lesion</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 020), and 1. 8 fold lower in patients with major <b>lesion</b> patients than in patients with low <b>lesion</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 023). Conclusion Increased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, especially oleic acid, and ECHDC 3 upregulation in patients with coronary artery <b>lesion</b> suggests that these are independent factors associated with the initial progression of cardiovascular disease.

We observed no evidence of migration of AP OECs or AP SCs after <b>lesion</b> site injections, with most cells remaining in or nearby the injection/lesion site. Acute injection of either cell type outside of the <b>lesion</b> site resulted {{in the presence of}} cells in the <b>lesion</b> even two hours after injection. However, after a 2 -week delay between DCC injury and cell injection, only OECs injected 2. 5 -mm outside of a DCC <b>lesion</b> entered the <b>lesion,</b> while SCs did not pass a region of increased astroglial immunoreactivity. GFAP-immunoreactivity also revealed differences in the astroglial scar at the <b>lesion</b> border with openings apparent in this region only in the OEC group. SCs induced greater ingrowth of CGRP-positive axons within the <b>lesion,</b> two weeks post-injury. Equivalent numbers of GAP- 43 -positive axons grew within the <b>lesion</b> after SC or OEC implantation. These findings show that, although there is no active migration for either cell type, both OECs and SCs are able to support axonal regrowth and/or sprouting into the <b>lesion.</b> The openings in the astroglial boundary at the <b>lesion</b> site may give OECs a potential advantage over SCs in promoting axonal growth through the astroglial scar. </p...|$|R

30|$|Because a PCL <b>lesion</b> is {{associated}} with a PLC <b>lesion</b> in 60 % of cases [47], if a PCL <b>lesion</b> is suspected or detected, we believe it is mandatory to look for a PLC <b>lesion</b> during history-taking and physical examination. Patients with a PCL <b>lesion</b> usually complain about nonspecific symptoms; the mechanism of injury usually reported is a posterior force applied to the tibia with the knee in flexion (football players or a fall on the flexed knee), and hyperextension or hyperflexion with or without a posteriorly directed tibial force [73]. After an acute PLC <b>lesion,</b> patients usually report an impact to the anteromedial aspect of the knee, contact or noncontact hyperextension, and a varus noncontact force. Because 15 % of PLC <b>lesion</b> are associated with a common peroneal nerve injury, it is important to ask the patient about numbness, tingling or muscle weakness, especially in ankle dorsiflexion or great toe extension [74]. Because of the biomechanical changes in PLC after a PCL <b>lesion</b> as previously described (see the “Biomechanics” section for further explanation), patients with a chronic PLC <b>lesion</b> usually do not report either a specific trauma or a PCL <b>lesion</b> that might have occurred several years before. A chronic <b>lesion</b> should be suspected during physical examination; gait analysis is useful for detection and should be systematically performed, we believe.|$|R
