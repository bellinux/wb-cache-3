500|$|Rare Replay is a {{compilation}} of 30 games developed by Rare and its predecessor, Ultimate Play the Game, over their 30-year history across platforms from the ZX Spectrum to the Xbox 360 (1983 to 2008), up until Rare's Kinect Sports series. The 30 games span multiple genres, including fighting, first-person shooter, simulation, 3D platforming, racing, and skiing. The compilation opens with a musical number featuring Rare characters. Each game has a <b>landing</b> <b>page</b> with a variation on its theme music. While the core gameplay remains unedited, Rare added extra features to the older releases. The player can toggle the visual appearance of scanlines and [...] "rewind" [...] up to ten seconds of gameplay in pre-Nintendo 64 games. The older games can be saved at will and autosave progress upon the player's exit. Rare also added an infinite lives cheat setting for some older games and fixed a game-breaking bug in Battletoads. The [...] "Snapshots" [...] feature presents small segments of the older games as challenges for the player, such as collecting a set amount of points in a set {{amount of time in}} a set scenario, similar in function to the NES Remix series. Some Snapshots are connected sequentially as a playlist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Using a {{total of}} 60, 419 ad links {{collected}} from three search engines (i. e., Bing, Google, and Yahoo), we characterize the “mobile-friendliness ” of <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> in sponsored search. In particular, we analyze the common and different characteristics between <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> made for desktop vs. mobile device users, measure/validate the quantitative scores for their mobilefriendliness, and classify the results with respect to types of queries and <b>landing</b> <b>pages.</b> Based on our findings, we articulate that: (1) current <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> (regardless of search engines or platforms) are not mobile-friendly enough, and (2) better datadriven methods (as opposed to current static methods) to help advertisers build mobile-friendly <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> are needed.

40|$|Abstract—Drive-by {{download}} attacks {{attempt to}} compromise a victim’s computer through browser vulnerabilities. Often they are launched from Malware Distribution Networks (MDNs) consisting of <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> to attract traffic, intermediate redirection servers, and exploit servers which attempt the compromise. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel approach to discovering the <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> that lead to drive-by downloads. Starting from partial knowledge of a given collection of MDNs we identify the malicious content on their <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> using multiclass feature selection. We then query the webpage cache of a commercial search engine to identify <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> containing the same or similar content. In this way {{we are able to}} identify previouslyunknown <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> belonging to already identified MDNs, which allows us to expand our understanding of the MDN. We explore using both a rule-based and classifier approach to identifying potentially malicious <b>landing</b> <b>pages.</b> We build both systems and independently verify using a high-interaction honeypot that the newly identified <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> indeed attempt drive-by downloads. For the rule-based system 57 % of the <b>landing</b> <b>pages</b> predicted as malicious are confirmed, and this success rate remains constant in two large trials spaced five months apart. This extends the known footprint of the MDNs studied by 17 %. The classifier-based system is less successful, and we explore possible reasons.
