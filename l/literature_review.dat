40|$|<b>Literature</b> <b>reviews</b> play an {{important}} role in the development of knowledge. Yet, we observe a lack of theoretical underpinning of and epistemological insights into how <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> can contribute to knowledge creation and have actually contributed in the IS discipline. To address these theoretical and empirical research gaps, we suggest a novel epistemological model of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews.</b> This model allows us to align different contributions of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> with their underlying knowledge conversions - thereby building a bridge between the previously largely unconnected fields of <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> and epistemology. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model by conducting an empirical analysis of 173 IS <b>literature</b> <b>reviews</b> which were published in 39 pertinent IS journals between 2000 and 2014. Based on this analysis, we derive an epistemological taxonomy of IS <b>literature</b> <b>reviews,</b> which complements previously suggested typologies...|$|R

25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} regarding the potential of applying virtual reality to different therapies. A systematic <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> published in 2012 analyzed 963 publications regarding virtual reality and rehabilitation from 1996 and 2010. Investigators found an increasing number of research done in the field yearly, from less than 10 articles per year in 1997 to more than 40 in 2010. More than the number of articles analyzed, this <b>literature</b> <b>review</b> found important issues to be addressed in future studies: i) the need to consider a greater number of participants in each study to best represent the target populations; ii) to improve the use of control groups; iii) to enhance the uniformity of the tests applied and iv) to execute more follow up studies in the field. These aspects would allow the comparison among different studies and the conceptualization of the results from different studies. Lastly, this investigation cites the importance of research in the field of virtual reality and rehabilitation, once the potential of this technology is recognized to support the neural and cognitive rehabilitation of different patients.|$|E
