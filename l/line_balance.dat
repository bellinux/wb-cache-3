50|$|An {{example of}} {{balanced}} lines is {{the connection of}} microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in {{the large majority of}} modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use electronic drive circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as star quad) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the <b>line</b> <b>balance,</b> and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.|$|E

The constraints as such could lower production rates ofthe line ifthey are not considered as integrated parts ofthe whole system. The research begins with manufacturing constraint analysis to identifr which one has the most impact and govems the productivity of the line. The output of the analysis is then used for comparing the efficiency between single-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> and multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> approaches. In addition, the algorithms to <b>balance</b> the <b>line,</b> i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methods, <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, line efficiency, output, and throughput time. It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> is less than the single-model one. In addition, the <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methods and <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms provide significant enhancements to line efficiency, output, and throughput time. The multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> combined with COMSOAL method contributes to higher line efficiency, higher output, and less throughput time.
