40|$|Academic {{research}} in the area of music and learning has proven that there is both a deficiency and need for classroom music education commencing at the primary grade levels. The research has shown that by incorporating music education into the academic curriculum the arts can be more effectively taught and other academic subject areas can gain from the diverse teaching strategies the arts bring to education. There are two goals of this project. One is to demonstrate to teachers what primary grade level students should be learning in music. A second goal of this project is to design a music education handbook for primary teachers that can serve as a basis for intergrating music into the curriculum. This handbook takes into consideration the general <b>lack</b> of <b>sufficient</b> <b>teacher</b> training in music instruction, along with teaching time constraints, and potential roadblocks, such as the acquisition of music and instrumental supplies...|$|R
50|$|The next decades saw much infighting {{among many}} of Newfoundlanders around the {{allocation}} of grant money. Government revenue was based mainly on customs dues, so grant money would grow or shrink depending {{on the state of}} the economy. This resulted in schools which were smaller than needed and <b>lacked</b> <b>sufficient</b> equipment, and <b>teachers</b> who were both under-educated and underpaid. The Education Act of 1876 set up Superintendents for each of the denominational schools: Catholic, Church of England, and Methodist, which made up 90 percent of the population. The situation only worsened as money was spent on building new schools rather than increasing teacher salaries, which continued to fall.|$|R
40|$|The Perceptions of Pre-service Special- and General-Education Teachers on the Inclusion of Children with Special Needs in the Regular Classroom By: Franchez Lynette Torres ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the study is to explore the {{perceptions}} of pre-service special- and general- education teachers in the Philippines about the inclusion of children with special needs (CSN) in the regular classroom. Teacher perception {{has been found to be}} a significant factor on implementing inclusion (Norwich, 1994; Elliot, 2008; Avramidis & Norwich, 2002). However, studies on this topic are lacking in the Philippines. The study employed a mixed method approach using both semi-structured interviews and survey using an adapted version of Saloviita's (2015) Teacher Attitudes to Inclusion Scale. The interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis and the survey data was analysed using two-way t-tests. The study determined that pre-service teachers in the Philippines had different sentiments about their prior experience and training on teaching CSN. Participants also had different definitions and understanding of inclusion. Moreover, the participants shared their concerns about the <b>lack</b> of <b>sufficient</b> <b>teacher</b> training and the current educational situation of the country as potential barriers to implementing inclusion. Lastly, the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study focused on}} four secondary school physics teachers in Bangladesh using semi-structured interviews and observations to explore their understanding {{about the relationship between}} practical work and developing students’ conceptual knowledge of physics. Recent studies indicate that practical work helps secondary science students easily and effectively learn the concepts and theories of physics. However, the secondary school physics teachers in Bangladesh in this study did not provide students with practical work during classroom teaching. Rather, they provided practical work in separate practical classes. Although the teachers believed that practical work made their teaching and also students’ learning easier and effective, they did not offer frequent practical demonstrations in teaching the contents of physics. The major findings of the study include that teachers used mostly transmissive pedagogy to assist students to understand physics concepts and theories. Even though there are clear and specific instructions for the teachers to do demonstrations in the secondary physics curriculum, there were constraints on teachers and on students trying to conduct practical work. Constraints included: a <b>lack</b> of <b>sufficient</b> equipment. <b>Teachers</b> and students in non-government schools faced comparatively more difficulties than those in government schools. Low teacher/student ratios and no positions for laboratory assistants were reasons given for teachers’ intense workloads. This study implies a need to provide government and non-government schools with necessary equipment for doing practical work; to appoint <b>sufficient</b> <b>teachers</b> with higher studies and training that includes practical work in physics; to create positions for laboratory assistants; to set up classrooms with a smaller number of students; and to develop awareness of the value of practical work among school administration and among physics teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate and analyse the policies of the Greek Ministry of Education, Life-long Learning and Religious Affairs (MoE) regarding Information and Communication Technology (ICT) integration in Secondary Education, and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers' cognitions and practices about the implementation of these policies, CALL and learner autonomy in Greek Secondary Schools. Sociocultural Theory (SCT) was the conceptual framework in the present study and a mixed-method research approach was employed. For the first part which focused on the ICT policies, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used to analyse the major ICT policy documents, starting from the setting up of infrastructure {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s until the present. The major ICT policies of the European Union (EU) were also discussed as they directly affected the ICT policies in Greece. Overall, it was found that the nodal discourse in these policies is 'the knowledge-based economy' and that ICTs are embedded in education to gradually transform it in order to answer the new needs and challenges of the information society. For the second part which investigated EFL teachers' cognitions and practices, a survey was conducted through questionnaires sent to Secondary Schools throughout Greece. The quantitative data of the questionnaires were analysed with descriptive statistics and the qualitative data were analysed with thematic analysis. The findings show that EFL teachers have positive cognitions about CALL and learner autonomy, however these cognitions are not realized on a regular basis due to mainly the unavailability or inaccessibility of computer facilities and the <b>lack</b> of <b>sufficient</b> <b>teacher</b> training. This study suggests that one way the MoE can further support ICT integration in education so that its investments in ICT have a substantial impact is by developing ICT facilities further, making changes in the curriculum, training all teachers in ICT integration, and also by enabling both teacher and learner autonomy in order to promote more ICT-enhanced, student-centred learning environments.
