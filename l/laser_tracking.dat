40|$|Although laser {{treatment}} of certain metals may enhance the wear performance in general it may result equally well in large residual stresses which affect he wear performance detrimentally. Tensile stresses {{generated in the}} surface layer may lead to severe cracking of the material. This paper describes urface stress situations found after laser treatments in samples of different materials (C 22, CK 60 and pure Fe) with single <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> and in samples with multiple overlapping <b>laser</b> <b>tracks.</b> The principal results of the X-ray measurements are the large stress variations {{inside and outside the}} <b>laser</b> <b>tracks.</b> The <b>laser</b> treatment gives rise to both tensile and compressive r sidual stresses. The residual stresses in and around <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> have their origin in plastic deformation due to thermal expansion and in volume changes due to phase transforma-tions. The plastic deformation is dictated by the strength of the material and the temperature function forced upon the material by the laser treatment. The residual stress tate in multiple <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> is of tensile character. Each new laid <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> exerts a tensile force upon the previous <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> by which the compressive stresses disappear. Some annealing and/or tempering occurs, leading to a decrease inthe absolute value of the stresses. 1...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to provide data {{for a study of}} {{correlation}} between the laser cladding parameters and the microstructure of Co-based coatings. Samples were made from laser clad coatings and single <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> on a 42 CrMo 4 steel bar with Eutroloy 16012 powder. These samples were cut longitudinally and transversally to the cladding direction. After that Orientation Imaging Microscopy scans of the samples were made at different parts of the <b>laser</b> <b>track.</b> A total of 42 Orientation Imaging Microscopy pictures were made in providing this data. A new experimental set-up and coating sample cut was introduced {{for the study of the}} microstructure in different positions inside <b>laser</b> <b>tracks.</b> It is found that the Vickers hardness of the dept and the heat-affected zone of a single <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> depends on the laser cladding speed. The hardness of the coating also correlates with the cladding speed due to the presence of the new and more pronounced interfaces at higher cladding speeds. ...|$|R
500|$|Without {{an atomic}} line filter, <b>laser</b> <b>tracking</b> and {{communication}} may be difficult. Usually, intensified charge-coupled device cameras {{must be used}} in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance. Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum. With the superior filtering system of an ALF, a non-intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently. [...] " [...] with passbands of about 0.001nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers". The total energy consumption of the latter system is [...] "30 to 35 times less" [...] than that of the former, so space-based, underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{main problem}} of laser {{hardening}} {{process is the}} over-tempered structure with a hardness decrement zone in the overlapped area between different <b>laser</b> <b>tracks,</b> which may not meet the minimum hardness requirements. The over-tempered structure {{is located at the}} middle of two overlapped <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> or between the beginning and the ending of a closed trajectory. In this paper, the hardness in the overlapped zones is studied by means of numerical simulations and experimental tests during a temperature controlled laser hardening with scanning optics process. Thus, in order to study their difference and to validate the proposed methodology, two steels with very different tempering curves has been used; a cold work tool steel and a medium-carbon low-alloy steel...|$|R
40|$|In laser {{transformation}} hardening {{the resulting}} mechanical properties often depend strongly on the achieved hardening depth {{as well as}} on the <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> width. The latter may be enhanced by statical and/or dynamical spot shaping using line integrators and beam oscillation, respectively. Intensity peaks remaining after statical beam shaping can be smoothed out by a slightly tilted rotating mirror. Thus an almost uniform intensity on a nearly rectangular spot may be obtained. The maximum achievable values of both the <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> width and the hardening depth are derived here for different materials as functions of the laser beam power on the basis of temperature field calculations using the program GEOPT. The results are confirmed by experiments...|$|R

In particular the influences of the main process parameters on the <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> dimensions and microstructure are examined. Typical dimensions of a single <b>laser</b> <b>track</b> are a width of 1. 8 mm and a depth of 0. 7 mm. The volume fraction of the homogeneous distributed WC particles is about 25 - 30 %. Important is that by overlapping the single <b>laser</b> <b>tracks</b> larger surface areas may be treated. In the Ti-alloy melt pool matrix TiC and W dendrites are present. The bonding between the ceramic particles and metal matrix is realized by reactions that occurred during the laser process. Around the WC particles a W 2 C layer was detected. followed by a TiC layer. Occasionally a crystal orientation relation between WC, W 2 C and TiC is observed, depending on the WC interface. When the surface of the WC particle is close to (0001) the preferred growing direction [0001] can be retained while the misfit at the WC/W 2 C interface is minimized...|$|R
