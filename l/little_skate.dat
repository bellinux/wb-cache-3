Round cuts from the little skate's wings are marketed as [...] "scallops", though due to their small size their commercial importance is limited. Little skates are also often used to bait traps, especially for lobsters and eels. Skates are typically caught as bycatch in otter trawls; the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> is not currently considered to be overfished. Along with the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> is often used as a model organism in biomedical research.

50|$|The diet of the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> {{consists}} {{mostly of}} decapod crustaceans and amphipods. Polychaete worms are {{also an important}} prey item, while other invertebrates (including isopods, bivalves, squid, sea squirts, and copepods) and small benthic fishes (including sand lances, herring, cunners, and cod) are rarely taken. The importance of crustaceans in the skate's diet increases with size. This species shares its benthic habitat with the similar winter skate; the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> focuses more on epifauna (organisms living atop the substrate) while the winter skate eats more infauna (burrowing organisms). The <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> has an extremely high number of electrosensory ampullae of Lorenzini around its mouth, giving it {{a high degree of}} spatial precision when hunting for prey buried in the substrate.|$|E

50|$|This skate is {{native to}} the western Atlantic Ocean, from Nova Scotia, Canada, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA. They are most {{abundant}} in the northern Mid-Atlantic Bight and the Georges Bank. <b>Little</b> <b>skates</b> prefer sandy or gravelly habitats from the shore {{to a depth of}} 90 m, though they have been caught as deep as 329 m. They can tolerate temperatures of 1.2 - 21 C and salinities of 27-33.8 ppt (though the optimum is 29-33 ppt). They do not undertake long migrations, but at the inshore parts of the species' range individuals move into shallower water during the summer and deeper water during the fall and winter. At the southern extent of the range, many also move north and south with changing temperatures.|$|R

The <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> may be confused with unspotted individuals of the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata), which has a similar shape.

5000|$|Eggs {{raised in}} captivity hatch in 5-6 months, while {{those in the}} wild may take up to 12 months to hatch, {{depending}} on temperature. While inside the case, the embryos have a whip-like extension on the tail believed {{to be used for}} circulating water. The newborns measure 93 - 102 mm long and are perfectly formed miniatures of the adults. After hatching, the empty egg capsules often wash ashore and are known as [...] "mermaid's purses". Growth is about 10 cm per year for the first three years, then slows down to 5 cm per year between the third and fourth years. At adolescence, males become larger than the females, and this difference persists through adulthood. Males mature at 32 - 43 cm long and females at 36 - 45 cm long. Very few <b>little</b> <b>skates</b> over 5 years old have been found, suggesting a high mortality rate at that age.|$|R

40|$|Our {{mission is}} to ensure that the Freshwater, Marine, and Wildlife Resources of the State of Rhode Island will be conserved and managed for {{equitable}} and sustainable use. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report summarizes the status marine fisheries resources, management, and related activities in Rhode Island for 2007. Rhode Island commercial fisheries landed almost 34 thousand metric tons valued at approximately $ 77 million in 2007, all species combined. The recreational fisheries harvested 2, 065 metric tons in 2007. Over half of recreational anglers were non-residents, as has been the case the past twenty-seven years. The most recent stock assessment information suggests that ten marine species important to Rhode Island are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. These are the stocks of Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic striped bass, bluefish, longfin squid (Loligo), silver hake—Southern stock, <b>little</b> <b>skates,</b> spiny dogfish, and witch flounder. Six species of commercial importance to Rhode Island are considered overfished and experiencing overfishing: monkfish, scup, tautog, winter flounder—Southern New England stock, winte...|$|R
50|$|The {{tail of the}} <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> {{contains}} an electric organ that intermittently generates a weak electric field (the electric organ discharge or EOD). The EOD lasts 70 ms and has a head-negative monophasic waveform. This electric organ is thought to function in communication, and may help potential mates locate one another.|$|E
50|$|An unusual <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> {{specimen}} found off Fishers Island, New York {{contained a}} developed testis, vas deferens, and functional clasper on its left side and an adolescent ovary, shell gland, oviduct, and abortive clasper on its right.

5000|$|The USSR {{won their}} first five games before meeting {{up with the}} host, and {{defending}} champion, Sweden. Sweden, having already lost eight to nothing to Canada, desperately needed to beat the Soviets, but settled for a one all tie. The {{final game of the}} tournament pitted the East York Lyndhursts, representing Canada, against the USSR, both teams being undefeated. Tournament organizers believed the Canadians would cruise to their seventh straight win and had begun to sell tickets for a planned tie-breaking game between the Soviets and Swedes to determine the European Championship.

40|$|Feeding {{mechanisms}} of aquatic vertebrates {{has been extensively}} studied in the past, while that of elasmobranchs remains limited. Skates and rays {{are believed to have}} evolved from a shark ancestor, thus they represent the most derived group. All skates are dorsoventrally compressed, have a unique jaw suspension type and head skeleton and live in benthic environments. It is unknown whether these derived features of skates have altered the ancestral shark feeding mechanism. Comparing feeding mechanisms in skates and sharks may shed light on morphological transformations that have arisen after the evolutionary split of these two groups. In this study prey capture and manipulation behaviors are compared and contrasted with the white-spotted bamboo shark. Jaw kinematics and buccal pressure during feeding events are investigated using sonomicrometry simultaneously with pressure transducers. <b>Little</b> <b>skates</b> capture prey primarily using biting but sometimes utilize weak suction as well. Pressure in the buccal cavity during prey capture varies around ambient ranging from slightly positive to slightly negative. In contrast bamboo sharks always use strong suction to capture prey with greater subambient buccal pressures. However, both species extensively process prey using strong suction alternately with compression. Such cycles can last several seconds, eventually ending in transport of the prey item. Greater subambient pressure develops in the buccal cavity during manipulation, indicating that skates are capable of generating stronger suction than that used to capture prey. Gape area during capture events is greater than during manipulation. Hyoid area attains similar magnitudes in both capture and manipulation events. Time of mean onset and peak gape and hyoid expansion occurs prior to peak buccal pressure in captures and manipulations. Although both occupy benthic regions of the ocean, prey capture in the two species appears to be quite different while manipulations are similar. Morphological differences in the jaw and hyoid apparatus of sharks and skates may be partly responsible for the functional differences in the generation of suction...|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>skate,</b> Leucoraja erinacea, is {{a species}} of skate in the family Rajidae, found from Nova Scotia to North Carolina on sand or gravel habitats. They {{are one of the}} {{dominant}} members of the demersal fish community in the northwestern Atlantic. This species is of minimal commercial importance and is mostly used as bait for lobster traps, though its wings are also marketed for food. It is also important as a model organism for biological and medical research.|$|E
50|$|Young {{and adult}} little skates are preyed upon by sharks, other skates, teleost fishes (including cod, goosefish, sea ravens, longhorn sculpins, bluefish, and summer flounder), gray seals, androck crabs (Cancer irroratus). Their egg-cases are preyed {{on by the}} sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and the whelk Buccinum undatum. Known parasites of the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> include the protozoans Caliperia brevipes, Haemogregarina delagei, and Trypanosoma rajae, the myxosporeans Chloromyxum leydigi and Leptotheca agilis, the {{nematode}} Pseudanisakis tricupola, and the copepods Eudactylina corrugata and Lernaeopodina longimana.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and <b>little</b> <b>skate.</b> Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E

I've been working hard on it for about four weeks, but I was working on utilities—programs to help make the finished game—for a couple of weeks before that. I always like to do the character set first because it buys time while you're thinking about the rest of it.

50|$|The {{inspiration}} for the work came from Constant Lambert, who was {{music director of the}} Vic-Wells Ballet during the 1930s and who exercised a major influence on the artistic as well as musical direction of the company. During his research, he chanced upon an old program for an 1849 ballet by Paul Taglioni entitled Les Plaisirs de l'Hiver, ou, Les Patineurs, which gave him the idea for a new skating ballet. To create the score he chose vocal and dance numbers from two Meyerbeer operas, Le prophète and L'Étoile du Nord, and linked them into an irresistibly cheerful score. Ninette de Valois was originally intended to be the choreographer, but Frederick Ashton heard Lambert playing the score on a piano and asked if he could take it on. He knew <b>little</b> about ice <b>skating,</b> but one of his dancers, Elizabeth Miller, did, and she demonstrated some movements and tricks for him. Transforming them into balletic vocabulary, he set out to create a ballet that would reveal the virtuosity of the burgeoning English ballet and win the public's approval.|$|R
60|$|Of <b>skating</b> <b>little</b> need be said; in so snowy {{a climate}} the rinks must be {{intelligently}} managed; their mismanagement {{will lead to}} many days of vexation and some petty quarrelling, but when all goes well, it is certainly curious, and perhaps rather unsafe, for the invalid to skate under a burning sun, and walk back to his hotel in a sweat, through long tracts of glare and passages of freezing shadow. But the peculiar outdoor sport of this district is tobogganing. A Scotchman may remember the low flat board, with the front wheels on a pivot, which was called a hurlie; he may remember this contrivance, laden with boys, as, laboriously started, it ran rattling down the brae, and was, now successfully, now unsuccessfully, steered round the corner at the foot; he may remember scented summer evenings passed in this diversion, and many a grazed skin, bloody cockscomb, and neglected lesson. The toboggan is to the hurlie what the sled is to the carriage; it is a hurlie upon runners; and if for a grating road you substitute a long declivity of beaten snow, {{you can imagine the}} giddy career of the tobogganist. The correct position is to sit; but the fantastic will sometimes sit hind-foremost, or dare the descent upon their belly or their back. A few steer with a pair of pointed sticks, but it is more classical to use the feet. If the weight be heavy and the track smooth, the toboggan takes the bit between its teeth; and to steer a couple of full-sized friends in safety requires not only judgment but desperate exertion. On a very steep track, with a keen evening frost, you may have moments almost too appalling to be called enjoyment; the head goes, the world vanishes; your blind steed bounds below your weight; you reach the foot, with all the breath knocked out of your body, jarred and bewildered as though you had just been subjected to a railway accident. Another element of joyful horror is added by the formation of a train; one toboggan being tied to another, perhaps to the number of half a dozen, only the first rider being allowed to steer, and all the rest pledged to put up their feet and follow their leader, with heart in mouth, down the mad descent. This, particularly if the track begins with a headlong plunge, {{is one of the most}} exhilarating follies in the world, and the tobogganing invalid is early reconciled to somersaults.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> has {{a rounded}} {{pectoral}} fin disk 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, and a blunt snout with a central tip. The jaws contain 38-66 series of round teeth on plates, adapted for grinding food. The pelvic fins are divided into two parts, with the forward lobe modified into a leg-like structure. The tail is longer than the disk in juveniles and shorter in adults. Two small, closely spaced dorsal fins are located near {{the tip of the}} tail. Adults have small dermal denticles and usually no midline thorns, though there are strong spines on the dorsal surfaces of the head, shoulders, and tail. Males tend to have fewer spines than females.|$|E
5000|$|Little skates {{are more}} active {{at night and}} spend {{much of the day}} buried in sediment, usually near {{specific}} landscape features such as depressions excavated by other animals. They employ a curious mode of locomotion, dubbed [...] "punting" [...] by the first scientists to document it, to move over the sea floor. The forward lobes of the pelvic fins are modified into leg-like structures called [...] "crura" [...] (singular [...] "crus"), containing three flexible joints and modified skeletal and muscular elements. The <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> pushes off the substrate with both crura and then glides a short distance on its wings while repositioning the crura for the next push. The crura are also used as pivots when the skate needs to turn. It has been speculated that using the pelvic fins in this manner assists in hunting, by reducing water turbulence that might alert the prey or distort the ray's electroreception.|$|E
50|$|Little skates are oviparous. Mating occurs {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} year and pregnant females can be found year-round. However, eggs are most common from October to December and from April to May, and least common from August to September and February to March. An average <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> spawns twice a year, in spring and fall, and produces a total of 10-35 eggs annually. Females deposit their egg capsules in pairs on sandy bottoms, in water no more than 27 m deep. The egg cases are amber-colored when first laid but become greenish-brown and leathery. Each roughly rectangular case contains a single fertilized egg and measures 44 - 63 mm long and 30 - 45 mm wide. There are hollow horns at each corner with sticky tendrils to secure the egg case to the substrate; the anterior horns are half {{as long as the}} case and curved inward, while the posterior horns are as long as the case and nearly straight.|$|E

The ice hockey stadium's cash register opens one and half hours before the match.In the International Sport Championships the domestic ice hockey team of Dunaujvaros played among national teams just like Ukrainian, German, Polish, Kazakh, Japanese for the trophy. Dunaujvaros has participated in the Hungarian MOL liga since 2008, in which it played ice hockey matches with Hungarian city teams for instance Debreceni HK, Újpesti TE, Ferencvárosi TC and Miskolci JJSE and with others from different countries in the international level HSC Csíkszereda, Corona Brasov, HC Nové Zámky. Zsolt Azari {{is the chairman of}} the DAB-Docler ice hockey team. The 1995/1996 years was very fruitful for the team, they were awarded with a gold, they won the national championship, two years later they became the second. 1999 and 2002 were the years, when the Ice Hockey World Cup's first Division's Group B was managed in Dunaújváros and in Szekesfehervar. There are many ice hockey generations, which are practising for the future on one hand, include the U8 championship, U10 championship, U12 [...] "preparing championship" [...] , U14 [...] "kiddie championship", U16 [...] "adolescent championship", U18 [...] "youth championship", [...] "junior championship" [...] and in the other hand the older professional players creates the MOL liga, national championships. One of the players is really talented, it is worth to speak about him, David Komaromi is a successful striker, from the U21. The U10 group, the U8 group, the U12 group usually plays in Croatia, Serbia (Belgrade). For the really young children the skating education is free. The Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation's vice-chairman, and the head couch of the Dunaferr SE supply got a Miklos Sera challenge-cup award because of his ice hockey coach accomplishment in 2009.The ice curling rink opened again in the winter season as free entertainment and sport center in 2002.

People could use the curling rink's free services on 15 February 2014. Dunaujvaros's Sport Center Complex, which contains the Football Stadium, the Handball Gymnasium, the Ice Hockey Stadium are connected to each other with roads in a Green Area. Ice Hall's main building has blue roof, which is underpinned with metal columns, the entrance is yellow similar with the window frames, the walls got grey colour-washing. Just to step in the building, {{there is a}} foreground with the cash register, the doors bound it. After the doors the visitor can approach the first floor, stares are there, or the ice skating rink, that is enclosed by a transparent plastic Plexiglas wall around the ice and parallel with the Plexiglas wall there is an corridor with a long bench, close to it hallmark a dressing room. The nearby Football Stadium of Dunaujvaros approximately twenty-five meters away from the Ice Hockey Stadium, the latter is one meter below if we observe the terrain, between them there some stares and a fence plant.In the case if somebody not goes up immediately at the left side of the hall to the grandstand, on the other side the visitor can find a platform for the television transmissions. There is a relative modern lighting technology system inside the hall's ceiling, the chairs made from plastic. Stadium was built with the southern eastern entrance door, there is another one from the northern west side of the building, and another one at the longitudinal of it which goes directly to the dressing room of the players. Some of the most finish strong, successful ice hockey players subjugated to France and Sweden by name Viktor Szelig (2006), Marton Vas (1997), Janos Vas (2000), Akos Agardy. Conversely there were a lot of foreign legionnaire from Russia, Canada, Slovakia, for instance the Canadian Kurt MacSweyn, the Russian Dimitri Tyeplakov. Igor Slivinsky was a Ukrainian foreign legionnaire. The Ice Hockey Stadium of Dunaújváros has a buffet for refreshments and four big electronic displays in a square format for the match actual result. There are five chair lines at the grandstand. In the city center the government usually builds up a <b>little</b> uncovered <b>skating</b> rink in December every year. There are other ice hockey stadiums in Hungry, to go not so far the ice funs can skate in Székesfehérvár, Fejér County, Paks (Tolna County), Kaposvár and Budapest.For the big crowd, when an ice hockey match is over, the car owners can use the other parking lot and can leave ahead to the Vasmu Street. Before they leave, a restaurant is offers dishes for the ice hockey funs, players, visitors in the main building, which is located immediately beside to the Sport Center Complex's Handball Gymnasium Stadium. In the restaurant's building, on the second floor the visitor can buy football tickets for the next match.|$|R

Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E

Two levels of maturity were recognized: onset maturity, which marks {{the onset of the}} allocation of energy from somatic growth to reproduction; and ‘‘functional’ ’ maturity, which marks the point when mature oocytes are released. Size at maturation increased with latitude in <b>little</b> <b>skate,</b> 50 % onset maturity occurring at 42. 5, 43. 0, and 46. 5 cm (total length) and 50 % functional maturity at 43, 44, and 46 cm for the mid-Atlantic, southern New England–Georges Bank, and Gulf of Maine regions, respectively. Based on age estimates from previously published work, the age at which <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> achieve functional maturation ranged between 7. 0 and 7. 5 years for the U. S. northeast coast. In winter skate, no statistically significant regional differences in maturation rates were found. Size at 50 % onset maturity was estimated to be 66 cm and at 50 % functional maturity 76 cm for the U. S. northeast coast. In winter skate, onset maturity occurred at 9. 5 years and functional maturity at 12. 5 years. Thus, functional maturity in this species occurred 3 years after the onset of maturation, indicating that the species has a long adolescence before contributing offspring to the population.

40|$|The ABC {{transporters}} {{bile salt}} export pump (BSEP; encoded by the ABCB 11 gene), MDR 3 P-glycoprotein (ABCB 4), and sterolin 1 and 2 (ABCG 5 and ABCG 8) are {{crucial for the}} excretion of bile salt, phospholipid, and cholesterol, respectively, into the bile of mammals. The current paradigm is that phospholipid excretion mainly serves to protect membranes of the biliary tree against bile salt micelles. Bile salt composition and cytotoxicity, however, differ greatly between species. We investigated whether biliary phospholipid and cholesterol excretion occurs in a primitive species, the <b>little</b> <b>skate,</b> which almost exclusively excretes the sulphated bile alcohol scymnolsulphate. We observed no phospholipid and very little cholesterol excretion into bile of these animals. Conversely, when scymnolsulphate {{was added to the}} perfusate of isolated mouse liver perfusions, it was very well capable of driving biliary phospholipid and cholesterol excretion. Furthermore, in an erythrocyte cytolysis assay, scymnolsulphate was found to be at least as cytotoxic as taurocholate. These results demonstrate that the <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> does not have a system for the excretion of phospholipid and cholesterol and that both the MDR 3 and the two half-transporter genes, ABCG 5 and ABCG 8, have evolved relatively late in evolution to mediate biliary lipid excretion. <b>Little</b> <b>skate</b> plasma membranes may be protected against bile salt micelles mainly by their high sphingomyelin conten...|$|E

We have sequenced the complete Hoxa cluster of the <b>Little</b> <b>Skate</b> (Leucoraja erinacea) and compared to the published Hoxa cluster of the Horn Shark (Heterodontus francisci) and to available data from the Elephant Shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome project. Results A BAC clone containing the full <b>Little</b> <b>Skate</b> Hoxa cluster was fully sequenced and assembled. Analyses of coding sequences and conserved non-coding elements reveal a strikingly high level of conservation across the cartilaginous fish, with twenty ultraconserved elements (100 %, 100 bp) found between Skate and Horn Shark, compared to three between human and marsupials. We have also identified novel potential non-coding RNAs in the Skate BAC clone, {{some of which are}} conserved to other species. Conclusion We find that the <b>Little</b> <b>Skate</b> Hoxa cluster is remarkably similar to the previously published Horn Shark Hoxa cluster with respect to sequence identity, gene size and intergenic distance despite over 180 million years of separation between the two lineages. We suggest that the genomes of cartilaginous fish are more highly conserved than those of tetrapods or teleost fish and so {{are more likely to have}} retained ancestral non-coding elements. While useful for isolating homologous DNA, this complicates bioinformatic approaches to identify chondrichthyan-specific non-coding DNA elements</p...|$|E
40|$|The Skate Genome Project, a {{pilot project}} of the North East Cyber {{infrastructure}} Consortium, aims to produce a draft genome sequence of Leucoraja erinacea, the <b>Little</b> <b>Skate.</b> The pilot project was designed to also develop expertise in large scale collaborations across the NECC region. An overview of the bioinformatics and infrastructure challenges faced {{during the first year}} of the project will be presented. Results to date and lessons learned from the perspective of a bioinformatics core will be highlighted...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{two approaches}} {{were used to}} increase the knowledge of elasmobranch population dynamics and life history: (1), the comparative approach and (2), the species-specific approach. In the comparative approach I constructed standardized three-stage matrix models for 55 species of sharks and rays. Using these models I (1) conducted elasticity analyses {{to determine how the}} vital rates of mortality (M) and fertility (f) influence elasmobranch population growth rate r, (2) estimated sensitivity of elasticity to perturbation in vital rates, and (3) examined the taxonomic distribution of model inputs and species vital rates, such as size at maturity (Lmat), and total length (Lmax). I found positive relationships between the elasticity of Lambda (population growth rate) to changes in juvenile and adult stages to longevity and age at maturity; however, the age at maturity and the elasticity of Lambda to changes in the adult stage relationship appeared to be invariant. Combining vital rates and elasticities, I found similar suites of life histories and demographics within taxonomic groups at various levels. Further I examined where (or if) elasmobranchs fall in the evolved triangular ordination of life history strategies proposed by Winemiller and Rose (1992). My results indicate that when plotted using only the teleost ordination, elasmobranchs appear to be periodic strategists, outside the limits of the teleost ordination. However, when elasmobranch data is included in the ordination they form the extreme range of equilibrium strategists and are grouped by order. In the species-specific approach, I found evidence for a strong latitudinal trend in maximum size (l sub infinity) and size at maturation (lmat) in <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> with individuals in northern regions reaching a larger size at maturity and maximum length and growing slower than <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> from more southern regions. No similar trend was found in winter skate. <b>Little</b> <b>skate</b> is smaller, reaches maturity at a younger age is faster growing and shorter lived then winter skate (Little skate: l sub infinity = 56. 1 cm, k = 0. 19 /yr, Tmax = 12. 5, Tmat = 7; Winter skate: l sub infinity = 122. 1 cm, k = 0. 07 /yr, Tmax = 20. 5, Tmat = 12. 5). Winter skate has higher annual fecundity then <b>little</b> <b>skate</b> of 26 - 101 and 21 - 57 eggs per year respectively. 	 Using estimated vital rates for winter skate and National Marine Fisheries Service's survey data an age-structured model was constructed for winter skate from 1963 - 1998. The model indicated that the western Atlantic population of winter skate was rebuilding in the 1980 's following overfishing in the 1960 's and 1970 's...|$|E
40|$|Chondrichthyan fishes are {{a diverse}} class of gnathostomes {{that provide a}} {{valuable}} perspective on fundamental characteristics shared by all jawed and limbed vertebrates. Studies of phylogeny, species diversity, population structure, conservation, and physiology are accelerated by genomic, transcriptomic and protein sequence data. These data are widely available for many sarcopterygii (coelacanth, lungfish and tetrapods) and actinoptergii (ray-finned fish including teleosts) taxa, but limited for chondrichthyan fishes.   In this study, we summarize available data for chondrichthyes and describe resources {{for one of the}} largest projects to characterize one of these fish, Leucoraja erinacea, the <b>little</b> <b>skate.</b>   SkateBase ([URL] serves as the skate genome project portal linking data, research tools, and teaching resources...|$|E
