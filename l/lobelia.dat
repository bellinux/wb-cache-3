5|$|Bogbean and Water <b>Lobelia</b> {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of {{only a small number of}} species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Muckross Lake and the Upper Lake {{are high}} quality {{oligotrophic}} systems, with {{water that is}} slightly acidic and low in nutrients. This is caused by run-off from the upland sandstones and blanket bogs in their catchment areas. They have diverse aquatic vegetation, including quillwort (Isoetes lacustris), shoreweed (Littorella uniflora), and water <b>lobelia</b> (<b>Lobelia</b> dortmanna).|$|E

25|$|The Afro-alpine moorlands of the Sanetti Plateau is {{the largest}} {{continuous}} area of its altitude on the entire continent of Africa. Carpeted in lichen covered rocks, and punctuated by Giant <b>lobelia</b> (<b>Lobelia</b> rynchopatelum) that grow to heights of up to 12 meters. The Plateau is also dotted with alpine lakes and streams, providing important resident wildlife resources, as well as wintering and passage stations for rare and regionally endemic birds.|$|E
25|$|The gametophytic {{chromosome}} number (is {{the number of}} chromosomes in each cell) for the giant Dendrosenecio is n = 50, and for the giant lobelias. Specifically Lobeliaceae, <b>Lobelia</b> subgenus Tupa section Rhynchopetalum it is n = 14. Only five of the 11 species of giant senecio {{and three of the}} 21 species of giant <b>lobelia</b> from eastern Africa remain uncounted. Although both groups are polyploid, Dendrosenecio is presumed to be decaploid (ten sets; 10x) and the <b>Lobelia</b> more certainly tetraploid (four sets; 4x), their adaptive radiations involved no further change in {{chromosome number}}. The cytological uniformity within each group, while providing circumstantial evidence that they descended from a single ancestor and simplifying interpretations of cladistic analyses, provides neither positive nor negative support for a possible role of polyploidy in evolving the giant-rosette growth-form.|$|E
25|$|Threatened {{species were}} Euterpe edulis, Tabebuia cassinoides, Protium kleinii, Swartzia flaemingii, <b>Lobelia</b> anceps, Ocotea odorifera, Hibiscus bifurcatus, Brosimum glaziovii and Pharus latifolius.|$|E

25|$|Hilda (Bracegirdle) Brandybuck: (b. 2954) The {{daughter}} of Bruno Bracegirdle. Sister to Hugo Bracegirdle and niece of <b>Lobelia</b> Sackville-Baggins (née Bracegirdle). She married Seredic Brandybuck and had three children: Doderic, Ilberic and Celandine. Hilda, {{her husband and}} children attended the Farewell Party of her relation Bilbo Baggins, where they were among his 144 special guests.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Bracegirdle: (b. 2950) A {{borrower}} (but not returner) of books.

Hugo's closer relations included his aunt <b>Lobelia</b> Sackville-Baggins (née Bracegirdle), {{and her son}} Lotho Sackville-Baggins. He was named after his grandmother's brother, Hugo Boffin.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, in {{the company}} of Prof. HHW Pearson, he {{undertook}} a trip to South West Africa to study Welwitschia, making stops at Port Nolloth, Lüderitz Bay, Swakopmund, Welwitsch Station and following the Swakop River to Haikamkab. In 1910 he and his wife departed Lourenço Marques for Kenya and Uganda, collecting in the Aberdare Mountains and returning with a new species of tree <b>Lobelia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to cash crops, settlers planted ornamental gardens around their homes. In 1853, printer, editor, politician and businessman, George Thomson {{bought a house}} in the nearby Village of Carlton, at St. Clair Avenue West and Old Weston Road. He recalled growing lilac, <b>lobelias,</b> orchids, prairie rose, and cacti, as well as bushes such as spiraea and St. Johns-Wort.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{altitude}} increases the temperature fluctuations become extreme {{and the air}} becomes thinner and drier. This region {{is known as the}} Afro-alpine zone. The environment here is isolated, with the only similar area nearby being the Aberdares, which are 80 km away. [...] Many of the species here are endemic, with adaptations to the cold and fluctuating temperatures. [...] Typical plants here include giant groundsels (senecios) and giant <b>lobelias.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Kauaʻi ʻakialoa was {{believed}} to have survived in forests above 1148 ft above sea level, but has been observed frequently flying to the lower elevations of the island. This once very rare and unique bird used its long curved bill to reach the nectar of <b>lobelias</b> and ʻohiʻa blossoms. It also eats insects from under tree bark and from under mats of lichens and moss on trees.|$|R
25|$|Otho Sackville-Baggins: (2910–3012) Otho was {{the only}} child of Longo and Camellia Sackville-Baggins. He {{inherited}} the headship of the Sackville family through his mother, Camellia. He also stood to inherit the headship of the Baggins family, which would have made him the head of two families at once. In 2942 his cousin Bilbo Baggins was presumed dead, and Otho's father was Bilbo's closest living heir. The Sackville-Bagginses nearly acquired Bag End, but were foiled by Bilbo's unexpected return. Otho's future wife, the formidable <b>Lobelia</b> Bracegirdle, was a little more successful: she had appropriated many of Bilbo's silver spoons. Many years later Bilbo adopted Frodo Baggins, a more distant relative, as his heir, thus thwarting Otho's ambitions for the Baggins inheritance. Otho was infuriated, and scrutinized Bilbo's will for any irregularities under the Shire's strict witnessing laws. Otho died between the time of Bilbo's Long Expected Party (which he attended) and Frodo's departure to Bree. Accordingly, he never enjoyed the luxuries of Bag End when <b>Lobelia</b> finally took ownership.|$|E
25|$|This {{found at}} an {{altitude}} of 3,300 m and above, which is the moorlands. Alpine grass (Deschampsia), distinguished by giant groundsell (Dendrosenecio johnstonii), <b>Lobelia</b> deckenii, and heath (Erica excelsa). Moorland communities are the main vegetation on this region. Shrub community consisting of Erica arborea and Hebenstretia angolensis are found between 3,000 m and 3,300 m, while a belt of bamboo is common between 2,400 and 3,300 m, and cover about 35,000 ha.|$|E
25|$|Shipton's Camp is {{administered}} by Bantu Utamaduni Lodge. It is home to many rock hyrax, as well as striped mice, many types of sunbirds and Alpine Chats. Mountain Buzzards fly overhead. The vegetation is dominated by giant groundsel, {{but there are many}} flowers and <b>lobelia</b> as well. On the skyline is a view of Points Peter and Dutton, with Batian overshadowing them. Also in view are Thompson's Flake and Point Thompson, with Point Lenana {{on the other side of}} the Gregory Glacier. In front of the main peaks is the Krapf Rognon, with the Krapf Glacier behind.|$|E
50|$|Eight of the 14 native {{bird species}} {{occurring}} at Hakalau are endangered. Thirteen migratory bird species and 20 introduced species, including eight game birds, {{as well as}} the endangered opeapea (Hawaiian hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus semotus) also frequent the refuge. Twenty-nine rare plant species are known from the refuge and adjacent lands. Twelve are currently listed as endangered. Two endangered <b>lobelias</b> have fewer than five plants known to exist in the wild.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{vegetation}} bands {{from the base}} to the summit. The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, such as the giant <b>lobelias</b> and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax. An area of 715 km2 around {{the centre of the}} mountain was designated a National Parkand listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The park receives over 16,000 visitors per year.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2012, Powell {{released}} [...] "Universe Mahalo: Volume #1" [...] {{which was}} the first official release of his solo project, [...] "Spaceship Aloha." [...] The songs are a combination of samples of traditional Hawaiian music with electronic beats. Powell has said the album was inspired by his time spent visiting Hawaii. A limited run of plantable postcards were made available for purchase as well. Each postcard included a download code and could than be planted and grown into blue <b>Lobelias.</b>|$|R
25|$|The track {{climbs up}} through the forest. On the {{northern}} {{side of the mountain}} there is no bamboo zone, so the forest gradually turns into moorland covered with giant heather. The track ends at Old Moses Camp and becomes a path. This continues up the hill before splitting into two routes. To the left, the least used path goes {{around the side of the}} Barrow, to Likii North Hut. The vegetation becomes more sparse, with giant <b>lobelia</b> and groundsels dotted around. The path climbs over a ridge, before rejoining the main path ascending the Mackinder Valley. Shipton's Cave can be found in the rock wall to the left of the steep path just before reaching Shipton's Camp.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{this is one}} of the commonest pondweeds, {{occurring}} in almost any wet or semi-wet oligotrophic and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of blanket bog but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as Ranunculus flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, oligotrophic waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., <b>Lobelia</b> dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a peaty substrate.|$|E
25|$|Gemini and Cheiron {{were the}} first {{characters}} to be created for the game. Gemini became the central heroine who would represent the Redneck stereotype, while the African American Cherion acted {{as a means for}} the story to tackle issues of discrimination in American culture. Each additional character was based around a particular theme; Rosarita was themed around Spaghetti Western culture, Subaru was a cold perfectionist similar to Sakura Wars 2 heroine Reni Milchstrasse, while Diana would be a handicapped character in a similar vein to <b>Lobelia</b> from Sakura Wars 3. Ratchet Altair, who had appeared in , was also included as a principle character and romance option. Rather than established protagonist Ichiro Ogami, the story focused on new protagonist Shinjiro. According to Hiroi, Shinjiro was the most difficult character to create, with the main aim being to differentiate his story from that of Ogami, with Shinjiro being made a more vulnerable character. The renewed cast played into the theme of a young country, whose actions would be performed in parallel to events in Japan. Fujishima was initially confused about the kings of characters Hiroi wanted, drawing multiple variations. Speaking about his design for Gemini, Fujishima described his design as having a samurai core within a stylized cowgirl.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact I was walking at that moment in {{imagination}} with Mrs Bowater at Lyme Regis, but I seized the opportunity of hastening round from between aunt and nephew so that I could screen myself from the sun in Mrs Monnerie's ample shadow, and inquired why London gardeners were so much attached to geraniums, <b>lobelias,</b> calceolarias, and ice-plants? Mightn't one just as well paint the border, Mrs Monnerie, red, yellow, and blue? Then it would last--rain, snow, anything.|$|R
50|$|It {{was seen}} {{gleaning}} {{the trees in}} search of insects. The bill of the akialoa was also designed for more than bug extraction. The akialoa also fed on nectar in the flowers of <b>lobelias</b> and o’hia blossoms. Its long bill could easily fit into petals of long flowers and took pollen from flower to flower on its forehead. It was collected at several places. It was {{once thought to be}} the same species as the Maui and Oahu form, but when specimens were compared all together the scientist saw that all three were different species.|$|R
2500|$|S. keniensis is frost {{resistant}} to [...] This ability {{to withstand the}} colder temperatures {{that occur in the}} upper altitudes of Mount Kenya is in part due (at least in <b>Lobelias)</b> to the large amounts of mucilage which are contained by the rosettes of leaves which that might assist in preventing the leaf bud from freezing and the reservoir of fluid from evaporating. As well as the nyctinastic behavior of the leaf rosettes which open during the day and close tightly around the leaf bud and meristem when it becomes cold at night; [...] the outer leaves bend inwards and form around the central leaf bud.|$|R
