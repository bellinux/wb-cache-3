The quality of <b>load</b> curve <b>data,</b> however, is hard to guarantee since the data is subject to communication losses, meter malfunctions, and many other impacts. In this paper, a new approach to analyzing <b>load</b> curve <b>data</b> is presented. The method adopts a new view, termed portrait, on the <b>load</b> curve <b>data</b> by analyzing the periodic patterns in the data and re-organizing the data for ease of analysis. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms to build the virtual portrait <b>load</b> curve <b>data,</b> and demonstrate its application on <b>load</b> curve <b>data</b> cleansing. Compared to existing regression-based methods, our method is much faster and more accurate for both small-scale and large-scale real-world datasets...|$|R
