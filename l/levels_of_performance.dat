5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5|$|This section covers 3 {{compliance}} requirements concerning recipient performance. They {{may require}} that recipients provide {{a level of}} contributions to a federal program, maintain specific <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> or achievement, or restrict the amount of federal funds used for a specific purpose. Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance. Specific requirements for matching, level of effort, and earmarking are unique to each federal program, and are described in the laws, regulations, and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program.|$|E
25|$|With the {{appearance}} of these quality players, a breakthrough was achieved in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in the late 1990s where the Zimbabwean team began winning Tests against other nations, which included a series win against Pakistan. Unfortunately, the political situation in Zimbabwe declined at around the same time, which had a detrimental effect on the national team's performances.|$|E
30|$|In {{the frame}} with L =  2.5 H, {{there was also}} a {{significant}} difference between the results of fire-alone and PEF resistance when the frame was pushed to arrive at LS and CP <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> Again, the fire resistance of fire-alone and IO <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> were approximately identical. However, the fire resistance of fire-alone situation from about 3  h and 40  min, reduced to about 90  min when the frame was pushed to arrive at the LS <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and to around 70  min at the CP <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Intraindividual {{variability}} and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in accuracy <b>of</b> four visuo-spatial {{working memory}} tasks {{were examined in}} sixty-two young adults. The objective was to study the relationships between intraindividual variability and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and to assess whether intraindividual variability is a useful marker of cognitive functioning. Correlational and factor analyses were performed. Confirmatory factor analyses rejected a two-factor representation, with a first factor representing <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and a second factor representing intraindividual variability. The best fitting model specified one factor per task and estimated significant within-task correlations of intraindividual variability residual scores. Overall, {{these findings are consistent}} with the view that performance variability provides valuable information independent <b>of</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and different from noise...|$|R

25|$|In digital {{wireless}} communication systems (GSM, CDMA etc.), PLLs {{are used to}} provide the local oscillator up-conversion during transmission and down-conversion during reception. In most cellular handsets this function has been largely integrated into a single integrated circuit {{to reduce the cost}} and size of the handset. However, due to the high performance required of base station terminals, the transmission and reception circuits are built with discrete components to achieve the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> required. GSM local oscillator modules are typically built with a frequency synthesizer integrated circuit and discrete resonator VCOs.|$|E
25|$|This {{extended}} {{architecture is}} designed to enable any level of intelligent behavior, {{up to and including}} human <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in driving vehicles and coordinating tactical behaviors between autonomous air, ground, and amphibious vehicle systems. It addresses the fundamental theoretical questions regarding whether computational processes are capable of emulating the functional processes in the brain, and provides a theoretical basis for understanding how the machinery of the brain generates the processes of the mind. Albus' work has led to a biologically plausible model of representation and computation in the human cortex.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, {{it is important to}} point out that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good performance measures from bad ones. Comparability is defined as the potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
30|$|In {{the frame}} with L =  1.5 H, {{there was a}} {{considerable}} difference between the results of fire-alone and PEF resistance when the frame was pushed to arrive at LS and CP <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> However, the fire resistance of fire-alone situation and IO <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> were roughly identical. The results showed that while the fire resistance in fire-alone situation was about 2  h and 30  min, it reduced to about 70 and 50  min at the LS and CP <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> respectively.|$|R
30|$|Overall, the PEF {{analysis}} in structures designed for IO <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> is only {{followed by a}} minor residual displacement, while at LS <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> along with some residual deformation and degradation in strength and stiffness, the removal of cover in a region around the plastic hinges should be considered. At CP <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> however, the structures not only sustain severe damage and considerable degradation in strength and stiffness, but rebars {{also need to be}} considered totally exposed in the PEF analysis.|$|R

She won the 3000m {{gold medal in the}} First League of the 2013 European Team Championships and ran a best of 8:39.65 minutes for the distance when placing fourth at the Rieti Meeting (which ranked her first among Europeans for the distance that year). A run of 15:04.36 minutes at the Bislett Games made her the top European that season and she went on to finish eighth in the final of that event at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics – Europe's best performer.|$|E
25|$|When European colonials {{entered a}} region, they {{invariably}} brought new resources and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on health, infrastructure, or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but {{certain types of}} spending {{have proven to be}} more beneficial than others. French economist Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of public spending were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence current <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and medical facilities decreased preventable illnesses in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery also learned that early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced {{the quality and quantity of}} public goods available today.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to survey the use of {{self-talk}} at triathletes. Are there any differences between the use of self-talk at triathletes with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> compared to triathletes at a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance?</b> There were a total of 20 participants in the study, where ten of them were athletes from the Norwegian national team of triathlon. These ten represented the participants <b>of</b> a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> The remaining ten, were club triathletes who represented the group with a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> There were completed both frekvency, correlation- and regressionanalyses, and the result can be understood like this; Triathletes generally have a greater degree to engage an inner monologue that are attached to a more positive way of thinking. These are interpretations that can not refer to a significant result. It was not found any significant differences between participants/athletes at a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> compared to the participants at a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> when it came to self-talk in competition settings. But it shows differences in the way self-talk is used and controlled. The results of the studies contributes with a new understanding of this case, but it also shows that there are need for some more research around the psychological aspect within the sport of triathlon.

He said later: [...] "Up to 100mph it's like you're running on rails, it's really stable. Then at about 110 to 120mph it starts getting tricky. At that point if a tyre blew up or something happened you would be surely dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussions between Iwata, [...] Miyamoto, and Takeda about a {{new home}} console began {{in the first half}} of 2003. With {{encouragement}} from Yamauchi, Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii. Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project, [...] "telling [...] to go off the tech roadmap." [...] The overall premise was that [...] "a Mom has to like it." [...] During the console's development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together, a feat they ultimately accomplished. Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> shown with the GameCube. Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo's engineers, Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone. Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda's team provided the internal components. After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes, Takeda procured a CMOS sensor that later became the core aspect of the remote. With the addition of accelerometers, they were able to effectively produce motion controls.|$|E

2500|$|Norman Doidge, {{following}} the lead of Michael Merzenich, separates manifestations of neuroplasticity into adaptations that have positive or negative behavioral consequences. For example, if an organism can recover after a stroke to normal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance,</b> that adaptiveness could be considered an example of [...] "positive plasticity". Changes such as an excessive level of neuronal growth leading to spasticity or tonic paralysis, or excessive neurotransmitter release in response to injury that could result in nerve cell death, are considered as an example of [...] "negative" [...] plasticity. In addition, drug addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder are both deemed examples of [...] "negative plasticity" [...] by Dr. Doidge, as the synaptic rewiring resulting in these behaviors is also highly maladaptive.|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{geographic}} groupings {{for music}} competitions are called regions instead of districts. Unlike academic and athletic districts, which only contain schools {{of a single}} conference, music regions contain schools of all sizes. [...] This is because competitions {{in most of the}} music events award ratings to schools and students based on their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> instead of ranking schools or students against one another, so {{it is not necessary to}} hold separate contests for the different conferences. The exception is in marching band, where for advancement purposes schools compete against schools in the same conference, and the 28 regions are grouped into five to seven areas (depending on the conference). [...] Sightreading also uses different conferences, but solely for the purpose of having all schools in a conference read the same piece.|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{performance}} of the DA42 is largely favourable, having been designed to incorporate not only high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> but the greatest possible degrees of passive safety in operation, alongside [...] excellent fuel economy and assisted by the implementation of various modern technologies. The flight controls themselves are proportionally responsive for performing even small manoeuvers and light motions. Both pilots are equipped with their own fighter-style central sticks, which are attached to an otherwise unobstructed cockpit floor. In a similar manner, a single combined power lever is used to regulate both the engine and propeller settings; the power levers are convenient and can be operated in a relatively easy manner. In comparison with other twin-engined aircraft in its category, the centre console of the DA42 is uncluttered, which {{is a result of}} the clean design of the controls.|$|E

These included the construction of highways, a postal service, public storehouses for food, monetary and agrarian reforms. He continued to redistribute land periodically and forbade all other sales of land to prevent wealthy citizens from reacquiring excessive amounts of land with their money. In 1840 it was decreed that rich landowners had to return {{a third of their}} holdings to the community. Calls for basic industrialisation and diversification of the economy into fields such as mining and forestry were ignored. He further centralised the administration, introduced the definition of three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in the triennial examinations for recruiting mandarins.
