25|$|Low {{temperature}} ionic liquids (below 130K) {{have been}} proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning <b>liquid</b> <b>mirror</b> telescope {{to be based on}} the Earth's moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long wave infrared light which is the form of light (extremely red-shifted) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface. Low volatility is important in lunar vacuum conditions.|$|E
25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See <b>Liquid</b> <b>mirror</b> telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new class of magnetically shaped {{deformable}} <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> made of a magnetic liquid (ferrofluid). Deformable <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> offer advantages with respect to deformable solid mirrors: large deformations, low costs and the possibility of very large mirrors with added aberration control. They have some disadvantages (e. g. slower response time). We made and tested a deformable mirror, producing axially symmetrical wavefront aberrations by applying electric currents to 5 concentric coils made of copper wire wound on aluminum cylinders. Each of these coils generates a magnetic field which combines to deform the surface of a ferrofluid to the desired shape. We have carried out laboratory tests on a 5 cm diameter prototype mirror and demonstrated defocus as well as Seidel and Zernike spherical aberrations having amplitudes up to 20 microns, which was the limiting measurable amplitude of our equipmen...|$|R

Large surveys, cosmological studies, variability studies are prime examples of astronomical research where LMTs can have a major impact.

60|$|The two shallops moved swiftly {{towards the}} islands, their oars {{shivering}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>mirror</b> of the sea, and producing almost {{the only sound}} that disturbed the universal stillness, for at that early hour Nature herself seemed buried in deep repose. A silvery mist hung over the water, through which the innumerable rocks and islands assumed fantastic shapes, and the more distant among them appeared as though they floated in air. A few seagulls rose startled from their nests, and sailed upwards with plaintive cries, as the keels of the boats grated on the rocks, and the men stepped out and hauled {{them up on the}} beach of one of the islets.|$|E

50|$|Ferrofluid mirrors {{are cheaper}} {{in terms of}} {{material}} cost, {{and are able to}} make more corrections due to its larger range of motion. The limitations {{associated with the use of}} mercury for deformable <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> can be solved through the use of ferrofluids. Ferrofluids are liquids that contain a suspension of colloidal ferromagnetic particles within a carrier liquid. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles align with the field and the liquid becomes magnetized. Stable ferrofluids have wide ranges of physical properties thus can be produced to suit many practical application needs.|$|R

50|$|In astronomy, the {{altitude}} in the horizontal coordinate {{system and the}} zenith angle are complementary angles, with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith, and {{is defined as a}} circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles. A zenith telescope is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and the Large Zenith Telescope are both zenith telescopes since the use of <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> meant these telescopes could only point straight up.|$|R
60|$|The terrace towards which Adelheid and {{her father}} {{advanced}} was an irregular walk, shaded by venerable trees that had been raised near the principal or the carriage gate of the castle, on a ledge of those rocks that form {{the foundation of the}} buildings themselves. It had its parapet walls, its seats, its artificial soil, and its gravelled allées, as is usual with these antiquated ornaments; but it also had, what is better than these, one of the most sublime and lovely views that ever greeted human eyes. Beneath it lay the undulating and teeming declivity, rich in vines, and carpeted with sward, here dotted by hamlets, there park-like and rural with forest trees, while there was no quarter that did not show the roof of a château or the tower of some rural church. There is little of magnificence in Swiss architecture, which never much surpasses, and is, perhaps, generally inferior to our own; but the beauty and quaintness of the sites, the great variety of the surfaces, the hill-sides, and the purity of the atmosphere, supply charms that are peculiar to the country. Vévey lay at the water-side, many hundred feet lower, and seemingly on a narrow strand, though in truth enjoying ample space; while the houses of St. Saphorin, Corsier, Montreux, and of a dozen more villages, were clustered together, like so many of the compact habitations of wasps stuck against the mountains. But the principal charm was in the Leman. One who had never witnessed the lake in its fury, could not conceive the possibility of danger in the tranquil shining sheet that was now spread like a <b>liquid</b> <b>mirror,</b> for leagues, beneath the eye. Some six or seven barks were in view, their sails drooping in negligent forms, as if disposed expressly to become models for the artist, their yards inclining as chance had cast them, and their hulls looming large, to complete the picture. To these near objects must be added the distant view, which extended to the Jura in one direction, and which in the other was bounded by the frontiers of Italy, whose aërial limits were to be traced in that region which appears to belong neither to heaven nor to earth, the abode of eternal frosts. The Rhone was shining, in spots, among the meadows of the Valais, for the elevation of the castle admitted of its being seen, and Adelheid endeavored to trace among the mazes of the mountains the valleys which led to those sunny countries, towards which they journeyed.|$|E

50|$|Since mercury {{metal and}} its vapor are both toxic to {{humans and animals}} there remains a problem for its use in any {{telescope}} where it may affect its users and others in its area. In the Large Zenith Telescope, the mercury mirror and the human operators are housed in separately-ventilated rooms. At its location in the Canadian mountains, the ambient temperature is fairly low, which reduces {{the rate of evaporation}} of the mercury. The less toxic metal gallium may be used instead of mercury but has the disadvantage of high cost. Recently Canadian researchers have proposed the substitution of magnetically deformable <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> composed of a suspension of iron and silver nanoparticles in ethylene glycol.

For example, they can replace mercury in conventional rotating <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors.</b> The main advantages offered include extremely low cost and, by coating a viscous liquid, the possibility of tilting the mirror by a few tens of degrees. We also have coated ferromagnetic liquids with these reflecting films. The resulting surfaces can be shaped by the application of a magnetic field, yielding reflecting surfaces that can have complicated shapes that can rapidly shift with time. These inexpensive and versatile optical elements could have numerous scientific and technological applications.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new technology}} for the fabrication of inexpensive high-quality mirrors. We begin by chemically producing {{a large number of}} metallic nanoparticles coated with organic ligands. The particles are then spread on a liquid substrate where they self-assemble to give optical quality reflective surfaces. Since liquid surfaces can be modified with a variety of means (e. g. rotation, electromagnetic fields), this opens the possibility of making a new class of versatile and inexpensive optical elements that can have complex shapes which can be modified within short time scales. Interferometric measurements show optical quality surfaces. We have obtained reflectivity curves that show 80 % peak reflectivities. We are confident that we can improve the reflectivity curves, for theoretical models predict higher values. We expect that nanoengineered <b>liquid</b> <b>mirrors</b> should be useful for scientific and engineering applications. The technology is interesting for large optics, such as large rotating parabolic mirrors, because of its low cost. Furthermore, because the surfaces of ferrofluids can be shaped with magnetic fields, one can generate complex, time varying surfaces difficult to make with conventional techniques.
