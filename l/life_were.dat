5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, Lithuania {{lost its}} {{independence}} and Marcinkus was largely forgotten. His memory was kept alive by the Lithuanian émigré press.

5|$|Except for his autobiography, MalcolmX left no {{published}} writings. His {{philosophy is}} known almost entirely {{from the many}} speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death.

5|$|Families at {{the base}} {{were able to take}} {{advantage}} of many of the opportunities that the facility provided for them, as life at Loring was not all military-related. Although Loring was constructed with support facilities including a hospital, chapel, and schools, other forms of civilian <b>life</b> <b>were</b> added over the years as well.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in <b>life</b> <b>were</b> made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E

5|$|Other {{literary}} works {{based on her}} <b>life</b> <b>were</b> published, mostly abroad, both by Polish emigres and by foreigners. Among them were Georg Büchner, Konstanty Gaszyński, Wacław Gąsiorowski, Tadeusz Korczyński, Antoni Edward Odyniec and Władysław Buchner. Józef Straszewicz published three successive versions of her biography in French.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{sense of}} values and the feeling of devotion to a cause, which became so {{characteristic}} of him in later <b>life,</b> <b>were</b> derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his <b>life</b> <b>were</b> spared.

60|$|But {{the male}} in him was scotched by the {{knowledge}} that she was not under his spell nor his influence. He wanted to go away from her. He rested in the knowledge that to-morrow he was going away, his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> really elsewhere. His <b>life</b> <b>was</b> elsewhere--his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> elsewhere--the centre of his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> not what she would have. She was different--there was a breach between them. They were hostile worlds.|$|R
5|$|Especially {{during the}} 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars Bob Wilson and Emlyn Hughes were brought out of {{retirement}} to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans of the strip Martin Kemp and Steve Norman, of the pop group Spandau Ballet. Geoff Boycott served for several years as Melchester's chairman, and Sir Alf Ramsey had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy lay in his coma. Players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, {{despite the fact that}} the clubs they played for in real <b>life</b> <b>were</b> never featured in the strip.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular <b>life</b> <b>were</b> more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} on 28 July 1866 in London to {{barrister}} Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter. She was educated by governesses and tutors, and passed a quiet and solitary childhood reading, painting, drawing, tending a nursery menagerie of small animals, and visiting museums and art exhibitions. Her interests {{in the natural world}} and country <b>life</b> <b>were</b> nurtured with holiday trips to Scotland, the English Lake District, and Camfield Place, the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents.|$|E

5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of <b>life</b> <b>were</b> created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} religious groups, {{rather than from the}} scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, the belief that the universe and <b>life</b> <b>were</b> created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E
5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant <b>life</b> <b>were</b> the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E

5|$|The {{last few}} years of his <b>life</b> <b>were</b> also {{occupied}} in collaboration with other Masonic researchers, such as Hughan and Gould, which eventually brought into being England's first research lodge, Quatuor Coronati. As acting Immediate Past Master, he guided the lodge through its {{first two years of}} existence, taking the chair in the frequent absences of the Master, Charles Warren, then Metropolitan Commissioner of Police. It is plain from Gould's obituary {{that the rest of the}} lodge looked on him as a mentor.|$|E
5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of the}} composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his <b>life</b> <b>were</b> collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} {{he attended}} {{in his early}} <b>life</b> <b>were</b> {{a part of a}} movement in the study of botany by artisans. This had been initiated by George Caley, James Crowther, John Dewhurst, John Mellor and Edward Hobson, the last of whom Horsefield met in 1809 at a meeting held at Radcliffe Bridge and whose knowledge he held in high regard. It was part of a broader working class movement involving the study of nature and natural history that developed in the late 18th century and continued into the next.|$|E
