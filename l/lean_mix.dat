Instead of concrete being poured into conventional monoliths, it was poured in layers with a <b>lean</b> <b>mix.</b> Next, the concrete was settled with immersed vibrators and then contraction joints were cut into the layer. These methods were not only cost-saving but instrumental in the development of roller-compacted concrete in dam construction.|$|E
50|$|Dense graded {{mixtures}} {{are currently}} designed with a Texas Gyratory Compactor (TGC). The TGC has {{a relatively high}} compactive effort and unlike the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC), the TGC compactive effort can not be varied to match the intended application. Therefore, the TGC tends to produce a dry <b>lean</b> <b>mix</b> regardless of the application. Ideally, one would want to design a richer mix for a low volume/low demand roadway and a leaner mix for a high volume/high demand roadway. More asphalt in the mix {{reduces the risk of}} cracking and less asphalt reduces the risk of rutting. It is possible to increase or decrease the amount of asphalt in the mixture by adjusting the target laboratory molded density down or up from the standard value of 96.0%. Seldom is the target lab density adjusted down from the standard of 96.0%; however, it is common practice to adjust the target laboratory molded density up to 97.0% or higher in order to get more asphalt into the mixture. This practice is acceptable and actually encouraged where warranted. However, some mixtures may become susceptible to rutting if they contain too much asphalt especially if the asphalt is relatively soft such a PG 64 -22, etc.|$|E

It can be seen from Table  4 that μ 0 and μ 70 are higher for richer mixes (Sp. T 140 M 40 PC) as compared to <b>lean</b> <b>mixes</b> (Sp. T 140 M 25 PC). Moreover, the percentage residual strength of specimen T 140 M 40 PC is lower than of specimen T 140 M 25 PC.

The ductility ratio μ 70 for specimens varies between 1.4 and 6.74. On the other hand energy ratio ξ 70 varies between 1.55 and 9.63. The ductility ratio μ 0 for specimens varies between 1.01 and 1.31. The corresponding energy absorption ratio ξ 0 varies between 1.0 and 2.02. It is also clear from Table  4 that as D/t ratio of the UPVC tube decreases the ductility and energy absorbing capacity increases in general and consequently ∆ 0, ∆ 50, ∆ 70, ∆ 80 and ξ 0, ξ 50, ξ 70 and ξ 80 increases.|$|R

Cryo-SEM revealed that comminuting the lean meat with different chloride salts resulted in the formation of different types of gel structures. Differences were mainly in gel strand thickness, the degree of interlinking between strands and the size of pores within the gels. KCl and 1. 5 % NaCl formed multi-component, mixed gels in the lean meat system, but formed more uniform gels when fat was added. The other chloride salts produced similar types of gels in both the <b>lean</b> meat <b>mixes</b> and meat batters. Monovalent salts resulted in a good distribution of fat globules in coherent matrices. The divalent salts were shown to promote protein aggregation in raw batters. The CaC 12 batter showed some fat instability but the fat channels were not well interconnected. MgC 12 caused widespread fat channelling and matrix disruption which was also visible by LM. The results indicate that some gel formation occurs in meat batters prior to cooking and suggest that the type of gel formed may depend on the relative amounts and type of protein in the aqueous phase.

40|$|A 76 mm outlet {{diameter}} radial swirler with 8 mm vane depth {{was investigated in}} a 140 mm combustor diameter condensing 20 kW ultra-low NOx boiler. The aim was to show that small turbulent flames could achieve compact ultra-low NOx water heating. Low NOx was achieved using <b>lean</b> well <b>mixed</b> low flame temperature combustion with a 0. 7 equivalence ratio (Ø). Thermal NOx formation was also minimised by cooling the flame downstream of the swirler outlet. A water cooled heat transfer coil was traversed into the flame to determine how close to the swirler exit the heat transfer could occur, without a major increase in the combustion inefficiency. This was shown to be 70 mm from the radial swirler throat outlet. Rapid fuel and air mixing was achieved using fuel injection through {{the wall of the}} 76 mm swirler outlet throat, assisted by a 41 mm diameter outlet orifice at the exit of the 76 mm internal diameter wall fuel injector. This created swirling flow with higher axial velocities and a more concentrated high turbulence region downstream of the orifice outlet.

The air inlet temperature was 400 K, which is typical of reverse air flow cooled combustion chambers at domestic water heater conditions. The strong swirling flow interaction with the heat exchanger coil give an 89 % thermal efficiency with the front of the coil 70 mm from the swirler outlet.

40|$|The microcombustor {{described}} in this report was developed primarily for thermal management in microsystems and as a platform for micro-scale flame ionization detectors (microFID). The microcombustor consists of a thin-film heater/thermal sensor patterned on a thin insulating membrane that is suspended from its edges over a silicon frame. This micromachined design has very low heat capacity and thermal conductivity and is an ideal platform for heating catalytic materials placed on its surface. Catalysts {{play an important role}} in this design since they provide a convenient surface-based method for flame ignition and stabilization. The free-standing platform used in the microcombustor mitigates large heat losses arising from large surface-to-volume ratios typical of the microdomain, and, together with the insulating platform, permit combustion on the microscale. Surface oxidation, flame ignition and flame stabilization have been demonstrated with this design for hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels premixed with air. Unoptimized heat densities of 38 mW/mm{sup 2 } have been achieved for the purpose of heating microsystems. Importantly, the microcombustor design expands the limits of flammability (Low as compared with conventional diffusion flames); an unoptimized LoF of 1 - 32 % for natural gas in air was demonstrated with the microcombustor, whereas conventionally 4 - 16 % observed.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{details of}} a laboratory study of the behaviour of cemented roadbases under load, the work relating {{to the use of}} relatively <b>lean</b> concrete <b>mixes</b> having sufficient workability to allow placing by slip-form paver. Large-scale comprehensively instrumented static loading tests were undertaken on 3 m diameter discs, continuously supported by a simulated subgrade of rubber, in order to investigate the material behaviour under conditions approaching those in a pavement structure. Test variables included mix type, slab thickness and subgrade support for which, in each instance, two cases were considered. Laboratory tests on associated control specimens provided material properties for use in subsequent analyses, and considerable emphasis was placed on determining the tensile stress-strain response under flexural and under uniaxial tension loading. The control tests were later extended to give the characterising properties at ages other than 7 days so that, in particular, the longer term performance under trafficking could be estimated. Test slab performance was evaluated primarily by an elastic multilayer analysis and it was found that good initial agreement was obtained between observed and predicted performance in terms of strain. The load at which a well-defined fracture of the test slabs occurred was very much higher than the value predicted from theoretical considerations and this is difficult to explain satisfactorily. It would seem, however, that the primary cracks induced were relatively stable under the test conditions imposed since pronounced discontinuity in both the load-strain measurements and the load-deflection measurements was identified at much lower loads, indicating the initiation of a failure mechanism. Comparison of tensile strains at discontinuity in the large-scale tests with those at discontinuity in the laboratory flexure tests showed good agreement. These strains are therefore thought to define an upper limit for predicting satisfactory long-term behaviour under trafficking whereby higher induced tensile strains would lead to reduced life-expectancy. A method for estimating these strains based on the use of tensile strength and electrodynamic elastic modulus is proposed. In conclusion, the investigation highlights the difficulty of obtaining meaningful data relating to the structural design of pavements incorporating a new material, and recommendations are made for further work in this area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reburning {{technology}} has been developed to adopt various commercial combustion systems. Fuel lean reburning is an advanced reburning method to reduce NOx economically without using burnout air, however {{it is not easy}} to get high NOx reduction efficiency. In the fuel lean reburning system, the localized fuel rich eddies are used to establish partial fuel rich regions so that the NOx can react with hydrocarbon radical restrictively. In this paper, a new advanced reburning method which supplies reburn fuel with oscillatory motion is introduced to increase NOx reduction rate effectively. To clarify whether forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel can effectively reduce NOx emission, experimental tests were conducted in vertical combustion furnace. Experiments were performed in flames stabilized by a gas burner. The natural gas is used as both main and reburn fuel and total thermal input is about 40 kW. The forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel is realized by electronic solenoid valve, so that fuel rich region and fuel lean region is established alternately. In the fuel rich region, NOx is converted to N 2 by reburning reaction, however unburned hydrocarbon and CO is oxidized in fuel <b>lean</b> zone and <b>mixing</b> zone at downstream where slightly fuel lean region is formed by mixing of two regions. The NOx reduction rate increases up to 41 % by forced oscillating reburn motion. And this paper makes clear that in order to decrease NOx when oscillating reburn fuel injection system is adopted, the control of factors such as frequency and duty ratio is very important...|$|R
40|$|Combustion of wood is {{increasing}} {{because of the}} needs of decreasing the emissions of carbon dioxide and the amount of waste going to landfills. Wood based fuels are often scattered on a large area. The transport distances should be short enough to prevent too high costs, and so the size of heating and power plants using wood fuels is often rather small. Combustion technologies of small-size units have to be developed to reach efficient and environmentally friendly energy production. Furnaces that use different packed bed combustion or gasification techniques areoften most economic in small-scale energy production. Ignition front propagation rate affects the stability, heat release rate and emissions of packed bed combustion. Ignition front propagation against airflow in packed beds of wood fuels has been studied. The research has been carried out mainly experimentally. Theoretical aspects have been considered to draw conclusions about the experimental results. The effects of airflow rate, moisture content of the fuel, size, shape and density of particles, and porosity of the bed on the propagation rate of the ignition front have been studied. The experiments were carried out in a pot furnace. The fuels used in the experiments were mainly real wood fuels that are often burned in the production of energy. The fuel types were thin wood chips, saw dust, shavings, wood chips, and pellets with different sizes. Also a few mixturesof the above were tested. Increase in the moisture content of the fuel decreases the propagation rates of the ignition front and makes the range of possible airflow rates narrower because of the energy needed for the evaporation of water and the dilution of volatile gases due to evaporated steam. Increase in the airflow rate increases the ignition rate until a maximum rate of propagation is reached after which it decreases. The maximum flame propagation rate is not always reached in stoichiometric combustion conditions. Increase in particle size and density transfers the optimum airflow rate towards fuel <b>lean</b> conditions. <b>Mixing</b> of small and large particles is often advantageous, because small particles make itpossible to reach the maximum ignition rate in fuel rich conditions, and large particles widen the range of possible airflow rates. A correlation was found forthe maximum rate of ignition front propagation in different wood fuels. According to the correlation, the maximum ignition mass flux is increased when the sphericity of the particles and the porosity of the bed are increased and the moisture content of the fuel is decreased. Another fit was found between sphericity and porosity. Increase in sphericity decreases the porosity of the bed. The reasons of the observed results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Flow reactor {{experiments}} and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements {{were used to}} investigate the importance of platinum oxide formation on Pt/BaO/Al 2 O 3 NOx storage catalysts during reactions conditions. The reaction studied was NO(g) + 1 / 2 O- 2 (g) NO 2 (g). During NO 2 exposure of the catalyst the NO 2 dissociation rate decreased during the reaction. This activity decrease with time was also studied with XPS and it {{was found to be}} due to platinum oxide formation. The influence of sulphur exposure conditions on the performance of the NOx storage catalysts was studied by exposing the samples to lean and/or rich gas mixtures, simulating the conditions in a <b>mixed</b> <b>lean</b> application, containing SO 2 The main results show that all samples are sensitive to sulphur and that the deactivation proceeds faster when SO 2 is present in the feed under rich conditions than under lean or continuous SO 2 exposure. Additionally, the influence of the noble metals present in the catalysts was investigated regarding sulphur sensitivity and it was found that a combination of platinum and rhodium seems to be preferable to retain high performance of the catalyst under SO 2 exposure and subsequent regeneration. Finally, the behaviour of micro-fabricated model NOx storage catalysts was studied as a function of temperature and gas composition with area-resolved XPS. These model catalysts consisted of a thin film of Pt deposited on one-half of a BaCO 3 pellet. It was found that the combination of SO 2 and O- 2 resulted in migration of Pt on the BaCO 3 support up to one mm away from the Pt/BaCO 3 interface...|$|R
500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was going to set herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five <b>mixes</b> <b>lean</b> largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'." [...] Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that [...] "'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple." ...|$|R
40|$|Alterations {{in energy}} balance must be {{accommodated}} by adjustments {{in the net}} storage of the major energy-yielding macronutrients: carbohydrate, protein, and fat. This study used continuous whole-body calorimetry to measure changes in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during a 12 -d imposed energy imbalance in six <b>lean</b> men on <b>mixed</b> diets (overfeeding: 16. 5 MJ/d, + 33 %, n = 3; underfeeding: 3. 5 MJ/d, - 67 %, n = 3). Changes in total energy expenditure (TEE) and its components were modest; TEE changed by + 6. 2 % (overfeeding) and - 10. 5 % (underfeeding). In consequence, body weight changed by + 2. 90 and - 3. 18 kg. Marked changes in metabolic fuel selection occurred {{over the course of}} the study. Carbohydrate intake (540 and 83 g/d for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively) exerted direct autoregulatory feedback on carbohydrate oxidation (551 and 106 g/d at day 12 for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively). Subjects were close to balance by day 5. Changes in protein oxidation were small and not sufficient to prevent the oxidation of body protein mass, or its accretion, in response to energy deficit or surplus. Fat oxidation (59 and 177 g/d for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively) was not sensitive to dietary fat intake (150 and 20 g/d, for overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively), rather, its oxidation was inversely related to the oxidation of other substrates. Changes in fat balance accounted for 74. 1 % and 84. 0 % of the energy imbalance during overfeeding and underfeeding, respectively. This study shows a clear oxidative hierarchy for the macronutrients. Metabolic fuel selection is dominated by the need to maintain carbohydrate balance. This induces inappropriate counterregulatory alterations in fat oxidation during energy surplus...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} review covers {{different aspects of}} lipid oxidation and protein oxidation in meat. The mechanism of lipid and protein oxidation, factors influencing lipid oxidation, the consequences of protein oxidation, measurement methods, and the interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color are introduced. The present thesis was aiming to {{study the effects of}} different fatty acid composition on lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color in minced pork stored in modified atmosphere packages (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) at 5 oC during 12 days of storage. The possible interactions between lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and meat color were also investigated. Minced meat differing in fatty acid composition was prepared by <b>mixing</b> <b>lean</b> minced meat and fat fractions obtained by dry fractionation. Three groups of minced meat were obtained, namely, more saturated, medium saturated and less saturated. Lipid and protein oxidation were measured by determining thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and free thiol content, respectively. Meat color measurement was performed using the Hunter L*, a*, b* system. The results showed that the less saturated group had higher oxidative stability in relation to lipid and protein oxidation than the more saturated and medium saturated groups, which might result from the balance between the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and the vitamin E content. This was supported by the finding that the less saturated samples contained more unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E than those in the more saturated and medium saturated groups. TBARS level was negatively related to free thiol content, indicating the presence of possible interactions between lipid and protein oxidation. Furthermore, a* values were found to be correlated to lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting likely interactions between these factors. However, color values were not influenced by fatty acid composition...|$|R
