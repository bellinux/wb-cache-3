[...] Released in 1996, No Code {{was seen as a}} {{deliberate}} break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album." [...] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles [...] "Who You Are" [...] (...) , [...] "Hail, Hail", and [...] "Off He Goes". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996.

Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision.

2500|$|Standardized testing {{places a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and {{pressure}} {{on children and}} teachers. Teachers are put under a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive.

In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this {{and the removal of}} a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. Teachers do not get the results back {{until the end of the}} summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.|$|E

50|$|Another way <b>of</b> {{reducing}} <b>stress</b> at work is {{by simply}} changing the workload for an employee. Some {{may be too}} overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work {{that they are not}} sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much <b>of</b> workplace <b>stress.</b> If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.|$|R

The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and took over three weeks to break down and re-record.

As an object of academic study, hadith has also been subjected into a serious investigation both to prove its authenticity in its narration and message, and to elaborate certain points of importance. Critical studies of hadith have been common in academic circles in the Muslim world and in the Western universities, one of which focuses on the contextual meaning of it. It is toward this end that this paper is aimed at. It is an attempt to make a contribution in the contextual analysis of hadith. By contextual analysis we mean a study that puts a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>stressing</b> on the meaning of a hadith by looking at the context from which it was said or reported. This way of studying hadith would help to understand it better in line with the dynamic nature of Islam. The paper argues that a hadith cannot be understood in isolation from its context. It also maintains that understanding its context would mean that one would be able to unveil and even reconstruct the hadith epistemology. Since the epistemology of a hadith lies in its meaning, the re-interpretation of a hadith according to its context would mean rediscovering the new dimension of the epistemology...|$|R
