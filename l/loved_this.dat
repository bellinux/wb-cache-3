It featured a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. In this little ballet, scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> little supernatural ballet.|$|E
25|$|Mickey first {{appeared}} animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932, however, the film strip {{was created for}} the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert. The Technicolor film process {{was used in the}} film production. Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, The Band Concert was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal. Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.|$|E

[...] The A.V.

Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical.

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E
500|$|Professional {{television}} critics deemed Martin Keamy {{a welcome}} {{addition to the}} cast. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly commented that Kevin Durand [...] "is emerging as a real find this season; he plays that mercenary part with a scene-stealing mix of menace and damaged vulnerability." [...] After Jensen posted what he thought were the fifteen best moments of the season, the New York Posts Jarett Wieselman [...] "ha to complain about one glaring omission from EWs list: Martin Keamy. [...] I have <b>loved</b> <b>this</b> character all season long—and not just solely for [...] physical attributes ... although those certainly don't hurt." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger reflected, [...] "He was only on the show for a season and not featured all that much in that season, but Kevin Durand always made an impression as Keamy. [...] Lots of actors might have his sheer physical size, but there's a sense of danger (insanity?) that you can't build at the gym, you know?" [...] IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that [...] "Keamy {{is one of the}} more striking new additions to Lost [...] season ... and is a welcome addition to the Lost universe." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that Keamy has [...] "so much charisma" [...] and she would [...] "rather find out more about [...] than most of the old-school Lost characters". [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts agreed with a reader's reaction to Durand's [...] "chilling portrayal" [...] of Keamy and posted it in his weekly column. [...] The reader, nicknamed [...] "huntress", wrote [...] "love him or hate him, nobody is neutral when it comes to Keamy, which is the hallmark of a well-played villain. [...] Even the camera seems to linger on Durand, who conveys malice with just a look or tilt of his head. [...] This role should give Durand's career a well-deserved boost".s Secret Weapon]", TV Guide. [...] Retrieved on June 28, 2008. [...] Following his demise, Whitney Matheson of USA Today noted that [...] "it seems Keamy, Losts camouflaged baddie, is turning into a bit of a cult figure." [...] A [...] "hilarious" [...] blog containing Keamy digitally edited into various photographs, posters and art titled [...] "Keamy's Paradise" [...] was set up in early June 2008. [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone thought that the blog was [...] "a great idea" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] and he called Keamy [...] "the Boba Fett of Lost".
