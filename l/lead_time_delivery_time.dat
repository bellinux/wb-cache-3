30|$|As {{stated by}} Tersine (1982), lead time usually {{consists}} {{of more than}} one component such as order preparation, order transition, supplier <b>lead</b> <b>time,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> and setup time components. Considering this fact lead time can be reduced by decreasing the time of these components with crashing cost, that is to say the lead time is controllable. Many researchers utilize controllable lead time in supply chain design problem to reduce the customers waiting time and increase the service level. Lee et al. (2007) proposed the continuous review inventory system with backorder discount and variable lead time, where capital investment leads to reduce the ordering cost and lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost. Their objective is to simultaneously optimize the order quantity, ordering cost, back-order discount and lead time. Ouyang and Chang (2002) proposed a model deals with lead time and set-up cost reductions on the modified lot size reorder point. In the proposed model lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost the model objective is to optimize the lot size, reorder point, set-up cost and lead time. Pan and Hsiao (2001) proposed an integrated inventory model with controllable lead time and backorder discount in which lead time crashing cost is a function of reduced lead time and orders quantities.|$|E
30|$|The {{successful}} Japanese experiences using JIT production {{show that}} the advantages and benefits associated with efforts to control the lead time can be clearly perceived. In fact, lead time usually consists of the following components: order preparation, order transit, supplier <b>lead</b> <b>time,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> and setup time (Tersine 1982). In numerous realistic situations, lead time can be reduced at an added crashing cost; in other words, it is controllable. By limitation the lead time, we can lower the safety stock, decrease the pasting caused by stockout, improve the examination level to the purchaser and enlarge the spirited ability in business. Inventory models considering lead time as a decision variable have been developed by several researchers recently. Initially, Liao and Shyu (1991) presented an inventory model in which lead time is a unique decision variable and the order quantity is predetermined. Ben-Daya and Raouf (1994) extended Liao and Shyu’s (1991) model to permit both the lead time and the order quantity as decision variables. In 1996, Ouyang et al. (1996) generalized Ben-Daya and Raouf’s (1994) model by allowing shortages with partial backorders. Later, Moon and Choi (1998) and Hariga and Ben-Daya (1999) modified Ouyang et al.’s (1996) model to consider the reorder point as another decision variable. In addition, based on the Ouyang et al.’s (1996) model, Pan and Hsiao (2005) further have discussed the inventory problem of backorder price discount.|$|E

However, these logistic networks are still poorly interconnected and this fragmentation is responsible {{for a lack of}} consolidation and thus efficiency. To cope with the seeming contradiction of just-in-time deliveries and challenging emissions targets, a major improvement in supply networks is sought here. This new organisation is based on the universal interconnection of logistics services, namely a Physical Internet where goods travel in modular containers for the sake of interconnection in open networks. If from a logical point of view, merging container flows should improve efficiency, no demonstration of its potential has been carried out prior to the here reported research. To reach this potentiality assessment goal, we model the asynchronous shipment and creation of containers within an interconnected network of services, find the best path routing for each container and minimise the use of transportations means. To carry out the demonstration and assess the associated stakes, we use a set of actual flows from the fast-moving consumer goods sector in France. Various transportation protocols and scenarios are tested, revealing encouraging results for efficiency indicators such as CO 2 emissions, cost, <b>lead</b> <b>time,</b> <b>delivery</b> travel <b>time,</b> and so forth.

As a result, many retailers are {{now in the process of}} better adjusting their logistics operations to their specific requirements against the backdrop of raising pressure in a highly competitive environment. In this light, we provide an exploratory study based on semistructured face-to-face interviews with 28 leading European grocery retailers. First we examine the current strategic designs of grocery retailers’ internal logistics networks. Next, we shift our focus to the resulting interdependencies in tactical supply chain planning between instore operations and upstream logistics processes. We have identified five interdependent planning issues: order packaging unit, store <b>delivery</b> pattern, store replenishment <b>lead</b> <b>time,</b> store <b>delivery</b> arrival <b>times</b> and arrival time windows, as well as roll-cage sequencing and loading carriers. Each of these mid-term planning interdependencies is evaluated with regard to implications in the stores, in transportation and in the distribution centers.

Customer service is however also a concern on the supply side of the company in the sense that assessing, selecting and developing suppliers to improve their customer service can make them contributing to the competitiveness of the company. It is from the latter perspective that this research has been carried out and it addresses the problem of the service that suppliers provide when procuring standardized items to replenish inventories in a repetitive manner. <b>Delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> accuracy are two of the customer service elements that have been considered and dealt with by academics as well as practitioners to a large extent. There are however two other <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> elements that may have major consequences when trying to improve a company’s performance. These two elements, <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability and <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> flexibility are focused in this paper.

40|$|In many {{industries}} {{the pricing}} {{of a product}} over time {{can be used to}} manage demand for the product. <b>Lead</b> <b>time</b> (or promised <b>delivery</b> <b>time)</b> is often a significant factor in price negotiations. However, the production planning literature has largely treated pricing decisions as exogenous while focusing on the allocation of production capacity between products over time. On the other hand, the marketing literature has generally ignored the effects of capacity constraints and focused on the effects of pricing. ^ In this research, we begin by reviewing the existing literature on integrated production – marketing research, focusing on those models that consider <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and capacity. We suggest a number of directions for future research that take advantage of recent developments in production planning models, as well as explicit modeling of feedback loops governing key parameters, which suggest a broader view of the problem. ^ Next, we develop an integrated single product model for dynamic pricing and <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> quotation, where <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are congestion dependent. We achieve this by means of a non-linear clearing function that relates the throughput of the production system to its work-in-process inventory. This allows us to capture interactions between pricing, sales and <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> that have generally not been considered in the past. We present numerical examples to demonstrate these interactions, as well as analytical results showing that the proposed model behaves quite differently from conventional models that ignore congestion. ^ Finally, we extend the above model to include multiple products, where the products compete for capacity but face independent demand streams. We model this competition by means of a clearing function that allocates capacity to products based on WIP levels and demand requirements. Analytical and numerical results show that our model has three levers for managing demand: price, load-dependent <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and WIP mix. In comparison, existing models from literature have only one lever: price. ^ Our models combine several aspects of the problem that were considered separately in the past, and are more aware of the delivery capabilities of the production system thus enabling more predictable revenues and better customer service. ...|$|R

The scheduling {{of parallel}} machines {{is a well-known}} problem in many companies. Nevertheless, not always all the jobs can be manufactured in any machine and the eligibility appears. Based on a real-life situation, we present a company which has three different sets of machines, called as high-level, medium-level and low-level respectively. Besides, there are release <b>times</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> related to the respective previous operations and following operations to the main process to be carried in the parallel machines. A set of n jobs to be scheduled on these m parallel machines are also distributed among levels. One job from a level can be manufactured in a machine of the same or higher level. Initially all the jobs are processed on the machines of high level. But a penalty appears when a job is manufactured in a machine different of this initial level. The proposed algorithm solves the problem with two criteria: the minimization of the completion time or makespan, Cmax, and the minimization of the total penalty. The objective is to determine or to approximate the Pareto front. Several alternatives are presented according to different rules to move a job from one machine to another and compared through numerical experiments. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The objective is to determine a sequence of the jobs on the machines so as to minimize maximum <b>delivery</b> completion <b>time</b> over all the jobs, where the <b>delivery</b> completion <b>time</b> of a job is the sum of its completion <b>time,</b> and the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> associated with that job. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic optimality of the Longest <b>Delivery</b> <b>Time</b> algorithm for the static version of this problem, and the Longest <b>Delivery</b> <b>Time</b> among Available Jobs (LDTA) algorithm for the dynamic version of this problem. In addition, we present the result of computational testing of the effectivenes...|$|R

Watermarking technology enables copyright protection for e-services but delays the packaging process and delivery. Instant delivery is a primary requirement for on-line businesses. The imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking has been studied extensively, but {{its impact on the}} performance of e-services, such as deferring delivery and requiring extra storage, has not yet been addressed. This paper investigates four watermarking schemes based on one-bit watermarking, multiple-bit watermarking, and their combinations, and explores such performance issues as preparation <b>time,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>time,</b> and storage requirements. The paper derives equations that describe the performance of watermarking schemes. It proves that schemes with multiple-bit watermarking can ensure instant delivery with the penalty of some extra storage requirements in the on-line media e-service setup. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: Copyright protection, digital watermarking, electronic service, media distribution, on-line business, on-line service, watermarking. As Gibeaut observes, the digital and academic communities stress the fre...|$|R
