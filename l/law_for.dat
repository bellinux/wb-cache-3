5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the <b>law</b> <b>for</b> the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E

In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the <b>law</b> (<b>for</b> example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal <b>law</b> <b>for</b> property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence.

5|$|Following his {{military}} service {{and return to}} Winchester in 1779, White studied jurisprudence under his uncle, Alexander White, {{one of the most}} preeminent lawyers practicing in the Shenandoah Valley.

White was admitted to practice law at Winchester in December 1782, after which he engaged in the practice of <b>law</b> <b>for</b> eleven years.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian <b>law,</b> <b>for</b> the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{conservation}} <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> the (2 + 1) -dimensional ANNV equation and KP-BBM equation with higher-order mixed derivatives are studied. Due to {{the existence}} of higher-order mixed derivatives, Ibragimov’s “new conservation theorem” cannot be applied to the two equations directly. We propose two modification rules which ensure that the theorem can be applied to nonlinear evolution equations with any mixed derivatives. Formulas of conservation <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> the ANNV equation and KP-BBM equation are given. Using these formulas, many nontrivial and time-dependent conservation <b>laws</b> <b>for</b> these equations are derived...|$|R

5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical <b>law</b> <b>for</b> the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared <b>law</b> <b>for</b> uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E
