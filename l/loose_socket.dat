50|$|People in {{this class}} can have {{problems}} with their gait. There {{are a number of}} different causes for these issues and suggested ways to modify them. For a gait that has abrupt heel contact, the cause can be excessive heel lever. This can be fixed by realigning their prosthetic foot. For jerky knee motions, the cause could be a <b>loose</b> <b>socket</b> in the knee or inadequate suspension. In that case, the socket might need replacing or they may need to realign the prosthesis. If they have prolonged heel contact, the cause could be problems with the heel lever in their prosthesis or a worn heel. Increasing heel stiffness or realigning the prosthesis corrects these issues. In some cases, prolonged heel contact or knees remaining fulling extended is a problem with training prosthesis use. Foot drag - often caused by an ill-fitting prosthesis - can be corrected by shortening the length of the prosthesis. Uneven length strides can be a result of problems with hip flexion or insecurity about their walk, both of which can be corrected by physical therapy.|$|E

50|$|Lower limb amputations {{effect a}} person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen {{consumption}} rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, {{they need to}} walk slower. People in this class use around 41% more oxygen to walk or run the same distance as some one without a lower limb amputation.People in this class can {{have a number of}} problems with their gait.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the radiographic and clinical {{outcome of the}} ScanHip total hip arthroplasty in 70 patients after 10 years. The Swedish National Hip Register, in which the end-point of the survival analysis is defined as revisions, reported a 10 -year survival rate of 94 % with the ScanHip, but in the present series 13 % of the femoral stems and 29 % of the sockets met the criteria for aseptic loosening. Focal osteolysis was found around 8 sockets (11 %) and 23 stems (32 %) and had occurred significantly oftener around <b>loose</b> <b>sockets,</b> but not around femoral stems. Linear polyethylene wear was significantly increased in <b>loose</b> <b>sockets,</b> but no relationship was noted between polyethylene wear and stem loosening or was there a correlation between clinical symptoms or patients' satisfaction and component loosening. Therefore precise serial long-term radiographic follow-up is the only satisfactory method for detecting aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasty. It gives the surgeon more detailed information about each case than survival analysis alone...|$|R
5000|$|The vibraslap {{was invented}} by Martin Cohen in 1967. Cohen was told by percussionist Bobby Rosengarden, [...] "If {{you want to make}} some money, make a jawbone that doesn’t break." [...] About the inventing process Cohen remembers, [...] "I had never seen a jawbone before, but I had heard one on a Cal Tjader album. I found out that it was an animal skull that you would strike, and the sound would come from the teeth {{rattling}} in the <b>loose</b> <b>sockets.</b> So I took that concept and invented the Vibraslap, which was my first patent." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the lamp}} becomes <b>loose</b> in the <b>socket</b> due to {{vibration}} or under-tightening, it can lose {{contact with the}} center contact and stop working until it is tightened. The bayonet type is resistant to vibration and {{much less likely to}} become loose.|$|R

50|$|During the 2006 Big East Tournament, Ray was poked {{in the eye}} by Carl Krauser {{during the}} {{semifinal}} game against Pittsburgh. His vision apparently left him {{for a period of}} time and his eyeball had seemed to come <b>loose</b> from the <b>socket,</b> leading most to believe it was an extremely serious injury. However, his vision returned and it turned out to be only soft tissue damage. He was able to play less than a week later in the NCAA tournament, without goggles. In his first game back, he led Villanova in scoring. While on the video it appeared as though his eye came <b>loose</b> from the <b>socket,</b> his eyelid actually went behind his eye, giving off the impression of his eye coming loose.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{equipped}} {{according to}} this standard will usually have two sockets {{at each end of}} the locomotive, and carriages will usually also have one or two <b>sockets.</b> <b>Loose</b> cables are then used to establish connection between the locomotive and the carriages, as well as from carriage to carriage.|$|R
40|$|In 1999, we {{reported}} on the 2 -year results {{of a series of}} 21 first-time socket revisions using impacted morselized allograft bone. Seven still migrated between 1. 5 and 2 years. Seventeen remained for the current 5 -year follow-up. No socket had been rerevised. Five sockets showed signs of radiographic loosening. These 5 cases also exhibited radiographic signs of allograft resorption as well as high rates of socket migration and rotation as measured by radiostereometric analysis. Of the 6 remaining sockets that had migrated between 1. 5 and 2 years, 3 stabilized and 3 were among those with signs of radiographic loosening. Fifteen patients (15 hips) revealed pain reduction at the 5 -year follow-up. Three had slight pain on walking that disappeared immediately at rest (pain score 4). All the others revealed either no pain (pain score 6) or slight pain that disappeared with activity (pain score 5). No pattern of early socket migration according to radiostereometric analysis could be identified, predicting later socket migration or loosening. The rate of cases with signs of radiographic loosening (29 %, 5 / 17) was comparable to that reported by the Nijmegen group but the follow-up was shorter in the current study. The rate of cases with signs of radiographic loosening was comparable to both conventionally cemented socket revisions and cementless revisions. The future will show if further sockets loosen and if the <b>loose</b> <b>sockets</b> up to date will end up in rerevisions...|$|R
50|$|Age 23, from Scurelle, Italy. Sarcoma (cancer) of pelvis; tumour {{so large}} that his left thigh became <b>loose</b> from the <b>socket,</b> leaving his left leg limp and paralysed. After taking the waters, he was free of pain and could walk. By February 1964 the tumour was gone, the hip joint had recalcified, and he {{returned}} to a normal life. His cure was recognized on 26 May 1976.|$|R
50|$|After Marcelle's suicide, the two flee to Spain, {{where they}} meet Sir Edmund. They witness a Madrid bullfight, which {{involves}} the prowess of handsome twenty-year-old matador, El Granero. Initially, El Granero kills the first bull that he encounters {{and the animal}} is consequently castrated. Simone then pleasures herself by vaginally inserting these taurine testicles. Unfortunately, El Granero is killed by the next bull that he fights, and his face is mutilated. As the corpse of El Granero {{is removed from the}} stadium, his right eye has worked <b>loose</b> from its <b>socket,</b> and is hanging, bloody and distended.|$|R
60|$|Another {{excellent}} {{case for}} investigation {{is offered by}} the ocelli on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant, which are shaded in so wonderful a manner as to resemble balls lying <b>loose</b> within <b>sockets,</b> and consequently differ from ordinary ocelli. No one, I presume, will attribute the shading, which has excited the admiration of many experienced artists, to chance--to the fortuitous concourse of atoms of colouring matter. That these ornaments should have been formed through the selection of many successive variations, not {{one of which was}} originally intended to produce the ball-and-socket effect, seems as incredible as that one of Raphael's Madonnas should have been formed by the selection of chance daubs of paint made by a long succession of young artists, not one of whom intended at first to draw the human figure. In order to discover how the ocelli have been developed, we cannot look to a long line of progenitors, nor to many closely-allied forms, for such do not now exist. But fortunately the several feathers on the wing suffice to give us a clue to the problem, and they prove to demonstration that a gradation is at least possible from a mere spot to a finished ball-and-socket ocellus.|$|R
5000|$|Osteoporosis: Rabbits, {{especially}} neutered {{females and}} those that are kept indoors without adequate natural sunlight, can suffer from osteoporosis, in which holes appear in the skull by X-Ray imaging. This reflects the general thinning of the bone, and teeth will start to become <b>looser</b> in the <b>sockets,</b> making it uncomfortable and painful for the animal to chew hay. The inability to properly chew hay can result in molar spurs, as described above, and weight loss, leading into a downward spiral if not treated promptly. This can be reversible and treatable. A veterinary formulated liquid calcium supplement with vitamin D3 and magnesium can be given mixed with the rabbit's drinking water, once or twice per week, according to the veterinarian's instructions. The molar spurs should also be trimmed down by an experienced exotic veterinarian specialised in rabbit care, once per 1-2 months depending on the case.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} five axial loading tests on large-diameter drilled piles {{socketed}} into rock {{are discussed in}} this paper. The piles were built on an Italian site where several shallow rock formations are found below <b>loose</b> soils. Pile <b>sockets</b> involved rocks with different strengths such as: marl, limestone, gypsum and diabase. The pile response during static loading depended on rock strength, length of the socket in rock, and length of the pile in soil. In this paper, an analytical model is {{used to evaluate the}} limit skin friction at the pile-rock interface. The model is based on the hyperbolic transfer function technique and allows back-analyses to be carried out easily. Following current empirical approaches, a preliminary appraisal of the model parameters is made using extensive data from laboratory and in situ tests. The parameters are subsequently modified by fitting the measured pile head displacements to computer simulation results. The shaft resistance values obtained from the analyses are compared with published values and found to be lower...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{retrospective}} study was planned {{to look at}} the indications of eye enucleations and eviscerations, and comprised all such procedures done at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2006 to December 2015. Data was collected regarding age at the time of procedure, gender, procedure type, indication for enucleation or evisceration, type of implant if used and complications. Of the 66 eyes of 65 individuals, 47 (71. 2 %) underwent evisceration and 19 (28. 8 %) enucleation. The mean age {{at the time of the}} procedures was 37. 86 ± 23. 09 years. The indication for enucleation or evisceration were keratitis 14 (21. 2 %), introcular tumours 13 (19. 7 %), trauma 10 (15. 2 %), endophthalmitis 10 (15. 2 %), cosmesis 10 (15. 2 %) and painful blind eye 9 (13. 6 %). Only 5 (7. 5 %) procedures had postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence, infected <b>socket,</b> <b>loose</b> suture, or stich abscess. Most of causes of enucleation and evisceration in this case series could have prevented through the application of evidence-based safety practices...|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course there}} came a time, at last, when Stephen could no longer borrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged to lie in wait for new men {{who did not know}} him. Such a victim was good-hearted, simple natured young Yates (I use a fictitious name, but the real name began, as this one does, with a Y). Young Yates {{graduated}} as a pilot, got a berth, and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk's office and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills, Stephen was there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very little while Yates's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands. The fact was soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous. But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen's promise to pay promptly {{at the end of the}} week was a worthless one. Yates called for his money at the stipulated time; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week. He called then, according to agreement, and came away sugar-coated again, but suffering under another postponement. So the thing went on. Yates haunted Stephen week after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it up. And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates appeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to pay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming, he would turn and fly, and drag his company with him, if he had company; but it was of no use; his debtor would run him down and corner him. Panting and red-faced, Stephen would come, with outstretched hands and eager eyes, invade the conversation, shake both of Yates's arms <b>loose</b> in their <b>sockets,</b> and begin-- ...|$|R
