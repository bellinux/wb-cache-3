Thus, the animals were treated with Poly (I:C), <b>Loxoribine</b> and CpG, the respective TLR ligands. MHV-infected mice inoculated with Poly (I:C) had significant lower levels of plasma transaminases and Ig, anti-MHV Ab, and uric acid than MHV-infected animals, whereas autoAb to kidney tissue were observed. <b>Loxoribine</b> only produced a slight decrease of uric acid levels and serum Ig. CpG showed deleterious effects on MHV-infected mice, since survival of animals dramatically dropped to about 10 %. AutoAb to mur-ine tissues and uric acid release were not affected, whereas transaminases and anti-MHV Ab were slightly elevated. Besides, CpG administration produced a decrease of the high levels of serum Ig induced by the virus. Therefore, results indicated that TLR 3 stimulation appeared to protect the animals against the viral infection, whereas CpG aggravated its signs. <b>Loxoribine,</b> the TLR 7 ligand...|$|E

However {{little is known}} of which PAMPs may be present in atheroma, or capable of stimulating inflammatory signalling in vascular cells. Materials and Methods DNA extracted from human carotid atheroma samples was amplified and sequenced using broad-range 16 S gene specific primers to establish historical exposure to bacterial PAMPs. Responsiveness of primary human arterial and venous endothelial and smooth muscle cells to PAMPs specific {{for each of the}} TLRs was assessed by measurement of interleukin- 8 secretion and E-selectin expression. Results Extracts of atheromatous tissue stimulated little or no signalling in TLR-transfected HEK- 293 cells. However, sequencing of bacterial DNA amplified from carotid atheroma revealed the presence of DNA from 17 different bacterial genera, suggesting historical exposure to bacterial lipopeptide, lipopolysaccharide and flagellin. All cells examined were responsive to the ligands of TLR 3 and TLR 4, poly inosine:cytosine and lipopolysaccharide. Arterial cells were responsive to a wider range of PAMPs than venous cells, being additionally responsive to bacterial flagellin and unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine DNA motifs, the ligands of TLR 5 and TLR 9, respectively. Cells were generally unresponsive towards the ligands of human TLR 7 and TLR 8, <b>loxoribine</b> and single stranded RNA. Only coronary artery endothelial cells expressed TLR 2 mRNA and responded to the TLR 2 ligand Pam 3 CSK 4.

40|$|Gut-derived, endotoxin-mediated {{hepatocellular}} {{damage has}} been postulated to {{play a crucial role}} in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury in rodents. Endotoxins induce production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) by Kupffer cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and contribute to liver injury. This study addressed the contribution of other TLRs and ligands to alcoholic fatty liver. C 57 Bl 6 /J mice were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet. Serum aminotransferase measurements, histological analysis, and quantification of liver TNF-a and TLR 1 - 9 messenger RNA (mRNA) were performed. The effect of TLR ligands on liver injury was assessed in vivo. Neomycin and metronidazole or diphenyleneiodonium sulfate (DPI) were administered to evaluate the role of gut bacteria and NADPH oxidase activity, respectively, in hepatic TLR expression. Enteral ethanol (EtOH) exposure induced steatosis and increased liver weight, aminotransferase levels, and expression of TLR 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 liver mRNA. Injection of lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), <b>loxoribine,</b> and oligonucleotide containing CpG (ISS-ODN) increased TNF-a mRNA expression more in the livers of EtOH-fed mice than in control mice. PGN, LPS, flagellin, and ISS-ODN induced liver inflammatory infiltrate in EtOH-fed mice but not control mice. Addition of antibiotics reduced the severity of alcoholic fatty liver without affecting TLR expression, whereas daily DPI injections reduced the EtOH-mediated upregulation of TLR 2, 4, 6, and 9 mRNA. In conclusion, EtOH-fed mice exhibited an oxidative stress dependent on upregulation of multiple TLRs in the liver and are sensitive to liver inflammation induced by multiple bacterial products recognized by TLRs.

40|$|CXC chemokines are potent attractants of {{neutrophil}} granulocytes, T {{cells or}} natural killer cells.

In contrast to CXC chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL 8), no CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR 3) ligand (ie CXCL 9, CXCL 10 and CXCL 11) was induced by bacterial TLR ligands in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC). However, peptidoglycan (PGN), double-stranded (ds) RNA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR 2, TLR 3 or TLR 4 ligands, respectively) synergized with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) at inducing CXCL 9 and CXCL 10. In contrast, enhanced CXCL 11 secretion was only obtained when IFN-gamma was combined with TLR 3 ligand. Furthermore, flagellin, <b>loxoribine</b> and unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide (TLR 5, TLR 7 and TLR 9 ligands, respectively) did not enhance IFN-gamma-dependent CXCR 3 ligand production in HMVEC. In analogy with TLR ligands, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), in combination with IFN-gamma, synergistically induced CXCL 9 and CXCL 11 in HMVEC and human fibroblasts, two fundamental cell types delineating the joint cavity. Etanercept, a humanized soluble recombinant p 75 TNF-receptor/IgG(1) Fc fusionprotein, neutralized synergistic CXCL 9 production induced by TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma, but not synergy between IFN-gamma and the TLR ligands PGN or LPS. Synovial chemokine concentrations exemplify the physiopathological relevance of the observed in vitro chemokine production patterns. In synovial fluids of patients with spondylarthropathies (ie ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis) or rheumatoid arthritis, significantly enhanced CXCL 9, but not CXCL 11 levels, were detected compared to concentrations in synovial fluids of patients with metabolic crystal-induced arthritis.

As keratinocytes represent the first barrier against exogenous pathogens in human skin, we investigated their complete functional TLR 1 – 10 expression profile. First, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed a very similar pattern of TLR mRNA expression when comparing freshly isolated human epidermis and cultured primary human keratinocytes. Thus, further experiments were carried out with primary keratinocytes in comparison with the spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. The quantitative expression of TLR 1 – 10 mRNA in real-time PCR of primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells was analysed. Both cell types constitutively expressed TLR 2, TLR 3, TLR 5, {{and to a lesser extent}} TLR 10. TLR 4 was only found in HaCaT cells, TLR 1 to a higher degree in primary keratinocytes. In line with this, LPS induced mRNA expression of CD 14 and TLR 4 only in HaCaT cells. After stimulation with various TLR ligands, the NF-κB-activated chemokine interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) was measured. In primary keratinocytes and HaCaT cells the TLR 3 ligand poly (I:C) was the most potent stimulator of IL- 8 secretion. The TLR ligands peptidoglycan, Pam 3 Cys and flagellin which bind to TLR 2, TLR 1 /TLR 2 heterodimer, and TLR 5, respectively, also induced IL- 8 secretion, whereas no IL- 8 was induced by LPS, R- 848, <b>loxoribine</b> and cytosine guanine dinucleotide-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. A corresponding pattern was found in the RelA NF-κB translocation assay after ligand stimulation of primary keratinocytes.

40|$|Interferon-β is an {{established}} treatment {{for patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS) but its mechanisms of action are not well understood. Viral infections are a known trigger of MS relapses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system, which sense conserved structures of viruses and other pathogens. Effects of interferon-β on mRNA levels of all known human TLRs (TLR 1 - 10) and the TLR adaptor molecule MyD 88 were analyzed in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) of healthy donors by quantitative real-time PCR and by transcriptome analysis in PBMCs of 25 interferon-β-treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Regulation of TLR protein expression by interferon-β was investigated by flow cytometry of leukocyte subsets of healthy subjects and of untreated, interferon-β-, or glatiramer acetate-treated patients with MS. Interferon-β specifically upregulated mRNA expression of TLR 3, TLR 7, and MyD 88 and downregulated TLR 9 mRNA in PBMCs of healthy donors as well as in PBMCs of patients with MS. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were identified as the major cell type responding to interferon-β with increased expression of TLR 7 and MyD 88 protein. In line with this, expression of TLR 7 protein was increased in pDCs of interferon-β-treated, but not untreated or glatiramer acetate-treated patients with MS. Interferon-β-induced upregulation of TLR 7 in pDCs is of functional relevance since pre-treatment of PBMCs with interferon-β resulted in a strongly increased production of interferon-α upon stimulation with the TLR 7 agonist <b>loxoribine.</b> Flow cytometry confirmed pDCs as the cellular source of interferon-α production induced by activation of TLR 7. Thus, upregulation of TLR 7 in pDCs and a consequently increased activation of pDCs by TLR 7 ligands represents a novel immunoregulatory mechanism of interferon-β.

Although TLRs are critical receptors of innate immunity, {{little is known about the}} immunological effects of TLR 7 /TLR 9 costimulation. We have analyzed the effects of TLR 7 /TLR 9 costimulation on IFN- � production by leukocytes and pDCs. Our experiments revealed that both synthetic (resiquimod and <b>loxoribine)</b> and natural (ssRNA 40) TLR 7 ligands abrogate CpG-A- and CpG-C-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) -induced IFN- � production by human leukocytes. Because TLR 7 ligands themselves represent important IFN- � inducers, we demonstrated that substimulatory TLR 7 ligand concentrations significantly inhibited CpG-A-induced IFN-�. Delayed addition of TLR 7 ligands still resulted in complete suppression of CpG-A-ODN-induced IFN- � production, suggesting that the inhibition is unlikely to be caused by a kinetic uptake advantage. Unlike for CpG-A and CpG-C, TLR 7 ligands did not inhibit CpG-B-ODN-induced IFN- � production. Experiments with purified human pDCs demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TLR 7 /TLR 9 costimulation were mediated directly by pDCs. Suppression of IFN- � production was not related to increased cell death and was also detectable in enriched mouse pDCs. Analyses of pDCs suggested that the TLR 7 signal regulates the outcome of TLR 7 ligand/CpG-A-ODN costimulation and can either inhibit (IFN-�) or promote (IL- 8 /CD 40) cytokine and surface marker expression. Our data reveal for the first time a strong inhibitory effect of TLR 7 stimulation on IFN- � production induced by CpG-A- and CpG-C-ODNs.

40|$|Based {{upon the}} {{recognition}} of antiviral compounds and single stranded viral RNA the Toll-like receptors TLR 7 and TLR 8 are suggested to {{play a significant role}} in initiating antiviral immune responses. Here we report the molecular characterization of the chicken TLR 7 / 8 loci which revealed an intact TLR 7 gene and fragments of a TLR 8 -like gene with a 6 -kilobase insertion containing chicken repeat 1 (CR 1) retroviral-like insertion elements. The chicken TLR 7 gene encodes a 1047 -amino-acid protein with 62 % identity to human TLR 7 and a conserved pattern of predicted leucine-rich repeats. Highest levels of chicken TLR 7 mRNA were detected in immune-related tissues and cells, especially the spleen, caecal, tonsil and splenic B cells. Alternative spliced forms of TLR 7 mRNA were identified in chicken, mouse and human and expressed in similar tissues and cell types to the major form of chicken TLR 7. The chicken TLR 7 + HD 11 cell line and fresh splenocytes produced elevated levels of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) mRNA after exposure to the agonists R 848 and <b>loxoribine.</b> Interestingly, none of the TLR 7 agonists stimulated increased type I interferon (IFN) mRNA whereas poly(I:C) (a TLR 3 agonist) up-regulated both chicken IFN-α and chicken IFN-β mRNA.

Stimulation of chicken TLR 7 with R 848 was chloroquine sensitive, suggesting signalling within an endosomal compartment, as for mammalian TLR 7.

OxPAPC inhibited TNF-&# 945; production, I&# 954;B&# 945; degradation, p 38 MAPK phosphorylation and NF-&# 954;B dependent reporter activation induced by stimulants of TLR 2 and TLR 4 (Pam 3 CSK 4 and LPS), but not by stimulants of other TLRs (PolyI:C, Flagellin, <b>Loxoribine,</b> ssRNA or CpG DNA) in macrophages and HEK- 293 cells transfected with respective TLRs, and significantly reduced inflammatory responses in mice injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with Pam 3 CSK 4. Serum proteins, including CD 14 and LBP, were identified as key targets for the specificity of TLR-inhibition since supplementation with excess serum, or recombinant CD 14 or LBP, reversed TLR 2 inhibition by OxPAPC, while serum accessory proteins, or expression of membrane CD 14, potentiated signalling via TLR 2 and TLR 4, but not other TLRs.

40|$|Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} of the central nervous system and the major cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults 1. With regard to etiology a genetic predisposition, environmental factors and (mainly viral) infections are being discussed. The pathogenesis is based on autoimmune processes involving auto-reactive T-Cells and antibodies. In MS mouse models toll-like receptors (TLR) play a regulatory role in the development and course of the disease. 2 As part of the non-adaptive immune system TLR sense highly conserved molecular structures of viruses and bacteria. Interferon-β (IFN-β) was approved in 1993 as the first specific MS therapeutic and remains the most commonly prescribed one 3. It interferes with viral replication, regulates numerous genes and modulates the immune system. By which exact mechanism IFN-β is effective in MS patients has not been completely elucidated. In this study the effect of IFN-β on human TLR 1 - 10 and the adapter protein MyD 88 was investigated. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were stimulated with IFN-β or were left untreated, and TLR mRNA and protein expression were determined by quantitative real time PCR and flow cytometry of different PBMC subpopulations, respectively. Likewise, expression of TLR 7 and MyD 88 protein was determined by flow cytometry of PBMC subsets from differently treated MS patients. The functional relevance of the TLR regulations was investigated by stimulation with TLR ligands and subsequent cytokine measurements by ELISA, Flowcytomix multiplexing and flow cytometry. Results This study showed that IFN-β upregulates the expression of TLR 3, TLR 7, and MyD 88 mRNA in PBMC and downregulates the expression of TLR 6 and TLR 9 mRNA in vitro. These regulations were time and dose dependent. Upregulation of TLR 7 and MyD 88 by IFN-β in vitro were also detected on protein level and were assigned to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). This effect of IFN-β on TLR 7 and MyD 88 expression was also shown in vivo: TLR 7 and MyD 88 protein were expressed stronger in pDC of MS/CIS patients treated with IFN-β compared to untreated or patients treated with glatiramer acetate. Upregulation of TLR 7 in pDC is of functional relevance since pre-stimulation of PBMC with IFN-β lead to a strongly increased IFN-α response by pDC upon stimulation with the TLR 7 -specific ligand <b>loxoribine.</b> pDC sense viruses via TLR 7 and initiate antiviral immune responses. The enhanced TLR 7 mediated antiviral immunity may contribute to the therapeutic effect of IFN-β in MS patients by preventing MS relapses that are known to occur more often during viral infections 4...|$|E
