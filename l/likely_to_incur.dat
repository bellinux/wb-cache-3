5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E

Although there are obvious defects in the system of adjustment, and in the method of obtaining {{the temperature of the}} mercury, I found that these instruments invariably worked well, and were less liable to derangement and fracture than any I ever used; the best proof I can give of this is that I preserved three uninjured during nearly all my excursions, left two in India, and brought a third home myself that had accompanied me almost throughout my journey.|$|E
60|$|We now {{proceeded}} to the palace-gate, {{which is a}} great pillared archway, of wonderful loftiness and state, giving admittance into a spacious quadrangle. A stout, elderly, and rather surly footman in livery appeared at the entrance, and took possession of whatever canes, umbrellas, and parasols he could get hold of, in order to claim sixpence on our departure. This had a somewhat ludicrous effect. There is much public outcry against the meanness of the present Duke in his arrangements for the admission of visitors (chiefly, of course, his native countrymen) to view the magnificent palace which their forefathers bestowed upon his own. In many cases, it seems hard that a private abode should be exposed to the intrusion of the public merely because the proprietor has inherited or created a splendor which attracts general curiosity; insomuch that his home loses its sanctity and seclusion for the very reason that it is better than other men's houses. But in the case of Blenheim, the public have certainly an equitable claim to admission, both because the fame of its first inhabitant is a national possession, and because the mansion was a national gift, one of the purposes of which was to be a token of gratitude and glory to the English people themselves. If a man chooses to be illustrious, he is very <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> some little inconveniences himself, and entail them on his posterity. Nevertheless, his present Grace of Marlborough absolutely ignores the public claim above suggested, and (with a thrift of which even the hero of Blenheim himself did not set the example) sells tickets admitting six persons at ten shillings; if only one person enters the gate, he must pay for six; and if there are seven in company, two tickets are required to admit them. The attendants, who meet you everywhere in the park and palace, expect fees on their own private account,--their noble master pocketing the ten shillings. But, to be sure, the visitor gets his money's worth, since it buys him the right to speak just as freely of the Duke of Marlborough {{as if he were the}} keeper of the Cremorne Gardens.|$|E
60|$|Sitting, as it were, in {{the gateway}} between the Old World and the New, where the steamers and packets landed {{the greater part}} of our {{wandering}} countrymen, and received them again when their wanderings were done, I saw that no people on earth have such vagabond habits as ourselves. The Continental races never travel at all if they can help it; nor does an Englishman ever think of stirring abroad, unless he has the money to spare, or proposes to himself some definite advantage from the journey; but {{it seemed to me that}} nothing was more common than for a young American deliberately to spend all his resources in an aesthetic peregrination about Europe, returning with pockets nearly empty to begin the world in earnest. It happened, indeed, much oftener than was at all agreeable to myself, that their funds held out just long enough to bring them to the door of my Consulate, where they entered as if with an undeniable right to its shelter and protection, and required at my hands to be sent home again. In my first simplicity,--finding them gentlemanly in manners, passably educated, and only tempted a little beyond their means by a laudable desire of improving and refining themselves, or, perhaps for the sake of getting better artistic instruction in music, painting, or sculpture than our country could supply,--I sometimes took charge of them on my private responsibility, since our government gives itself no trouble about its stray children, except the seafaring class. But, after a few such experiments, discovering that none of these estimable and ingenuous young men, however trustworthy they might appear, ever dreamed of reimbursing the Consul, I deemed it expedient to take another course with them. Applying myself to some friendly shipmaster, I engaged homeward passages on their behalf, with the understanding that they were to make themselves serviceable on shipboard; and I remember several very pathetic appeals from painters and musicians, touching the damage which their artistic fingers were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>incur</b> from handling the ropes. But my observation of so many heavier troubles left me very little tenderness for their finger-ends. In time I grew to be reasonably hard-hearted, though it never was quite possible to leave a countryman with no shelter save an English poorhouse, when, as he invariably averred, he had only to set foot on his native soil to be possessed of ample funds. It was my ultimate conclusion, however, that American ingenuity may be pretty safely left to itself, and that, one way or another, a Yankee vagabond is certain to turn up at his own threshold, if he has any, without help of a Consul, and perhaps be taught a lesson of foresight that may profit him hereafter.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} risk premia affect the {{valuation}} of financial distress costs, because these costs are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>incurred</b> in bad times. We compute the NPV of distress costs using risk-adjusted default probabilities that {{are derived from}} corporate bond spreads. Because credit spreads are large, {{the magnitude of the}} risk-adjustment is substantial. For a firm whose bonds are rated BBB, our benchmark calculations show that the risk-adjusted NPV of distress is 4. 5 % of pre-distress firm value. In contrast, a valuation of distress costs that ignores risk premia produces an NPV of distress of 1. 4 %. The risk adjustment also increases the marginal effect of leverage on distress costs. We show that risk-adjusted, marginal distress costs can be of similar magnitude as the marginal tax benefits of debt derived by Graham (2000). Thus, distress risk premia can help explain why firms appear rather conservative in their use of debt...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevailing}} valuation {{technique in}} Emerging Markets adds the country risk {{spread to the}} discount rate in an ad-hoc manner. This practice {{does not account for}} the term structure of default risk. The mismatch between the duration of the project being valued and the duration of the measure of country risk used, such as J. P.

Even if the term structure of default risk were flat, this practice implies attenuating the covariance risk premium. Using sovereign bond data from five Emerging Markets, we estimate a simple model that captures most of the variation of expected collection at different horizons for a given country at one point in time. We show the mispricing errors that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>incurred</b> in practice and how our model can be used to avoid them...|$|R

By adjusting the values of these parameters, the total expenditure can be minimized. Internet technology makes it possible to provide software patches, and this encourages early release. Here we examine the major cost factors and derive a canonical expression for the minimum total expenditure. We show analytically that when the minimum is achieved (1) testing will continue beyond the time of release and (2) the number of software errors in the package when testing ends will be a constant (i. e., the package will have a guaranteed reliability).

40|$|Competing {{demands for}} public sector {{investment}} for new social infrastructure has prompted Australian governments to increasingly {{turn to the}} private sector to form partnerships in the construction, ownership and operation of social infrastructure assets (PPPs). The research described in this paper focuses on ‘hard social infrastructure projects’ i. e. projects which relate to the provision of physical infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Soft social infrastructure projects such as social security and community services are outside the scope of this research. Hard social infrastructure projects are characterised as generally being smaller in scale than hard economic infrastructure projects (motorways, bridges, tunnels etc.) and by their very nature, also tend to be complex, particularly in terms of ongoing involvement with the community. Thus private sector bidders for hard social infrastructure PPP projects are often presented with a situation where the financial rewards are less and the operational demands are more complex than for hard economic PPP projects.
