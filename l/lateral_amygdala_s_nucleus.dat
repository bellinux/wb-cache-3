Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we explore the role of morphine in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons of rats. The results demonstrate that perfusion of 10 mu M of morphine to the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> inhibits the discharge frequency significantly. We further find that there are no significant influences of morphine on the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). Interestingly, morphine shows no marked influence on the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons. These results indicate that acute morphine treatment {{plays an important role in}} the modulation on the excitatory synaptic transmission in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons of rats...|$|R
50|$|The amygdala, {{previously}} {{mentioned as a}} region showing high activity for the emotion of regret, is the central recipient for brain activity concerning fear-conditioning. Several streams of information from multiple brain areas converge on the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> allowing {{for the creation of}} associations that regulate fear-conditioning; Cells in the superior dorsal <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> are able to rapidly pair the neutral stimulus with the aversive stimulus. Cells that project from the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> to the central amygdala allow for the initiation of an emotional response if a stimulus is deemed threatening.|$|R
50|$|In fear conditioning, {{the main}} {{circuits}} {{that are involved}} are the sensory areas that process the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, certain regions of the amygdala that undergo plasticity (or long-term potentiation) during learning, and the regions that bear {{an effect on the}} expression of specific conditioned responses. These pathways converge in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala.</b> Long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity that enhances the response of <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons to the conditioned stimulus occurs in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala.</b> As a result, the conditioned stimulus is then able to flow from the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> to the central nucleus of the amygdala. The basal and intercalated masses of the <b>amygdala</b> connect the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> with the central nucleus of the amygdala directly and indirectly. Pathways from central nucleus of the amygdala to downstream areas then control defensive behavior (freezing) and autonomic and endocrine responses. Recent studies implicate the prelimbic cortex in fear expression as well, possibly by way of its connections to the basal and then to the central nucleus of the amygdala.|$|R
50|$|Hebbian {{plasticity}} {{is believed}} to involve N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and are located on postsynaptic neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala.</b> NMDARs {{are known to be}} coincidence detectors of presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarization. Auditory inputs are NMDARs in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> and use glutamate as a transmitter. Furthermore, it was tested that when the region's neurons that received auditory inputs also received unconditioned stimulus inputs and broad spectrum NMDAR antagonists in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> resulted in the disruption of the acquisition of fear learning. Therefore, these receptors are crucial to the metabolic pathway of processing and eliciting for the percept of fear.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{mechanisms}} underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) in the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> using in vitro slice preparations. In normal bathing medium, LTP was not induced by tetanic stimulation (100 pulses at I 00 Hz). However, {{in the presence}} of a GABAA blocker, picrotoxin or bicucuUine, LTP was reproducibly induced in both medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala.</b> In the medial amygdala, the LTP induced {{in the presence of}} picrotoxin was blocked by 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (APV), an NMDA receptor antagonist, and was significantly reduced by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. On the other hand, the LTP in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> was not affected by APV, but was significantly reduced by scopolamine. These results uggest that both NMDA receptors and muscarinic receptors are involved in the induction of medial amygdala LTP, while muscarinic receptors, but not NMDA receptors, are involved in the induction of <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> LTP...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} molecular, cellular, {{and circuit}} {{changes that occur}} in the brain during learning, we investigated the role of a glutamate receptor subtype in fear conditioning. In this form of learning, animals associate two stimuli, such as a tone and a shock. Here we report that fear conditioning drives AMPA-type glutamate receptors into the synapse of a large fraction of postsynaptic neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> a brain structure essential for this learning process. Furthermore, memory was reduced if AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation was blocked in as few as 10 to 20 % of <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons. Thus, the encoding of memories in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> is mediated by AMPA receptor trafficking, is widely distributed, and displays little redundancy...|$|R

40|$|The calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) {{that follows}} trains of action {{potentials}} {{is responsible for}} controlling action potential firing patterns in many neuronal cell types. We have previously shown that the slow AHP contributes to spike frequency adaptation in pyramidal neurons in the rat <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala.</b> In addition, a dendritic voltage-gated potassium current mediated by Kv 1. 2 -containing channels also suppresses action potential firing in these neurons. In this paper we show that this voltage-gated potassium current and the slow AHP act together to control spike frequency adaptation in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> pyramidal neurons. The two currents have similar effects on action potential number when firing is evoked either by depolarizing current injections or by synaptic stimulation. However, they differ in their control of firing frequency, with the voltage-gated potassium current but not the slow AHP determining the initial frequency of action potential firing. This dual mechanism of controlling firing patterns is unique to <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons {{and is likely to}} contribute to the very low levels of firing seen in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons in vivo...|$|R
50|$|Synaptic input can be {{strengthened}} when {{activity in the}} presynaptic neuron co-occurs with depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron. This is known as Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis is especially appealing as an explanation for how simple associative learning, such as that taking place in fear conditioning, might occur. In this model of fear conditioning, strong depolarization of the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> elicited by the stimulus leads to the strengthening of temporally and spatially relative conditioned stimulus inputs (that are coactive) onto the same neurons. Experimental data {{has been shown to}} support the idea that the plasticity and fear memory formation in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> are triggered by unconditioned stimulus-induced activation of the region's neurons. Thus, unconditioned stimulus-evoked depolarization is necessary for the enhancement of conditioned stimulus-elicited neural responses in this region after conditioned-unconditioned pairing and pairing a conditioned stimulus with direct depolarization of the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala's</b> pyramidal neurons as an unconditioned stimulus supports fear conditioning. It is also clear that synaptic plasticity at conditioned stimulus input pathways to the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> does occur with fear conditioning.|$|R

40|$|At glutamatergic synapses, calcium influx through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is {{required}} for long-term potentiation (LTP); this is a proposed cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning. Here we show that in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> pyramidal neurons, SK channels are also activated by calcium influx through synaptically activated NMDARs, resulting in depression of the synaptic potential. Thus, blockade of SK channels by apamin potentiates fast glutamatergic synaptic potentials. This potentiation is blocked by the NMDAR antagonist AP 5 (D(-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphono-valeric acid) or by buffering cytosolic calcium with BAPTA.

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} evidence regarding whether calcium-permeable receptors are removed during group I mGluR-mediated synaptic depression. In {{support of this}} hypothesis, AMPAR rectification, a correlative index of the synaptic expression of GluA 2 -lacking calcium–permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), is known to decrease after the induction of several types of group I mGluR-mediated long-term depression (LTD), suggesting that {{a significant proportion of}} synaptic CP-AMPARs is removed during synaptic depression. We have previously demonstrated that fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> is reversed by group 1 mGluR-mediated depotentiation. Here, we examined whether CP-AMPARs are removed by mGluR 1 -mediated depotentiation of fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation. The synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs was negligible before, increased significantly 12 hrs after, and returned to baseline 48 hrs after fear conditioning, as evidenced by the changes in the sensitivity of <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> synaptic responses to NASPM. Importantly, the sensitivity to NASPM was not altered after induction of depotentiation. Our findings, together with previous results, suggest that the removal of CP-AMPARs is not required for the depotentiation of fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> synapses...|$|R

40|$|Dr Christopher William ButlerStudies {{into the}} {{mechanisms}} of memory have long searched for a concept known as the engram, defined as the change that occurs in a neuronal circuit to underlie the encoding of memory. However, a complete description of the specific neuronal changes that occur following the encoding of any type of memory {{has not yet been}} published. This thesis used context- and auditory-fear conditioning as a model of learning, and a transgenic approach of identifying functionally activated neurons, to identify neurons throughout the brain that were specifically activated by fear learning. Discrete populations of neurons were identified within the amygdala, hypothalamus and septum, and neuronal activation was shown to occur specifically following the acquisition of auditory fear memories, with minimal activation in these regions due to the non-learning aspects of the conditioning process, such as tone exposure, shock exposure, or expression of fearful behaviour. These different populations of neurons may form nodes in the circuit for fear conditioning. One population of activated neurons was identified within the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> a key region involved in fear conditioning. Activated neurons in this region also expressed the phosphor-activated form of ERK 1 / 2 kinase. As fear-learning has previously been shown to require phosphor-activation of ERK 1 / 2 in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> this suggests that the identified population of neurons in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> is not only activated by, but directly involved in fear learning. The electrophysiological properties of neurons within this region were then investigated via random patch-clamp recording. Neurons from fear-conditioned mice show modified action potential dynamics when compared to neurons from home cage mice, and a subset of neurons recorded from fear conditioned mice display modified synaptic activity. Finally, the activated neurons within the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> were specifically targeted for patch-clamp experiments via the development of a novel method for visualising activated neurons in live brain slices. The population of activated neurons within the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> displayed significant differences in synaptic activity when compared with neighbouring, nonactivated neurons. Given that these changes occur in neurons shown to be directly involved in fear learning, they may underlie the encoding of auditory fear memory in vertebrates, thus bringing a description of the engram one step closer.

Inhibition of the p 190 RhoGAP-downstream kinase ROCK in LA during fear conditioning impaired long- but not short-term memory.

40|$|Glucocorticoids, {{released}} in high concentrations from {{the adrenal cortex}} during stressful experiences, bind to glucocorticoid receptors in nuclear and peri-nuclear sites in neuronal somata. Their classically known mode of action is to induce gene promoter receptors to alter gene transcription. Nuclear glucocorticoid receptors are particularly dense in brain regions crucial for memory, including memory of stressful experiences, such as the hippocampus and amygdala. While it has been proposed that glucocorticoids may also act via membrane bound receptors, {{the existence of the}} latter remains controversial. Using electron microscopy, we found glucocorticoid receptors localized to non-genomic sites in rat <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> glia processes, presynaptic terminals, neuronal dendrites, and dendritic spines including spine organelles and postsynaptic membrane densities. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a region specifically implicated in the formation of memories for stressful experiences. These newly observed glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactive sites were in addition to glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactive signals observed using electron and confocal microscopy in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> principal neuron and GABA neuron soma and nuclei, cellular domains traditionally associated with glucocorticoid immunoreactivity. In <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> glucocorticoid receptors are thus also localized to non-nuclear-membrane translocation sites, particularly dendritic spines, where they show an affinity for postsynaptic membrane densities, and may have a specialized role in modulating synaptic transmission plasticity related to fear and emotional memory...|$|R

40|$|While the {{amygdala}} {{is considered to}} {{play a critical role}} in temporal lobe epilepsy, conclusions on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms have been derived largely from experimental animal studies. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize synaptic network interactions, focusing on spontaneous interictal-like activity, and the expression profile of transmitter receptors in the human <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> in relation to temporal lobe epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings, obtained intra-operatively in vivo in patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, revealed the existence of interictal activity in amygdala and hippocampus. For in vitro analyses, slices were prepared from surgically resected specimens, and sections from individual specimens were used for electrophysiological recordings, receptor autoradiographic analyses and histological visualization of major amygdaloid nuclei for verification of recording sites. In the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> interictal-like activity appeared as spontaneous slow rhythmic field potentials at an average frequency of 0. 39 Hz, which occurred at different sites with various degrees of synchronization in 33. 3 % of the tested slices. Pharmacological blockade of glutamate α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, but not N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, abolished interictal-like activity, while the γ-aminobutyric acid A-type receptor antagonist bicuculline resulted in a dampening of activity, followed by highly synchronous patterns of slow rhythmic activity during washout. Receptor autoradiographic analysis revealed significantly higher α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, metabotropic glutamate type 2 / 3, muscarinic type 2 and adrenoceptor α(1) densities, whereas muscarinergic type 3 and serotonergic type 1 A receptor densities were lower in the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> from epileptic patients in comparison to autopsy controls. Concerning γ-aminobutyric acid A-type receptors, agonist binding was unaltered whereas antagonist binding sites were downregulated in the epileptic <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> suggesting an altered high/low-affinity state ratio and concomitant reduced pool of total γ-aminobutyric acid A-type receptors.

This current is selectively targeted to the primary apical dendrite of these neurons. Activation of mu-opioid receptors by application of morphine or D-Ala(2) -N-Me-Phe(4) -Glycol(5) -enkephalin (DAMGO) potentiates spike frequency adaptation by enhancing the alpha-dendrotoxin-sensitive potassium current. The effects of mu-opioid agonists on spike frequency adaptation were blocked by inhibiting G-proteins with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and by blocking phospholipase A(2).

Recent findings show that inactivation of a Ca 2 +-dependent K+ current, mediated by large conductance BK-type channels, also contributes to spike broadening. Here, using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we examine spike broadening in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> projection neurons. Spike broadening is frequency dependent and is reversed by brief hyperpolarisations. This broadening is reduced by blockade of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and BK channels. In contrast, broadening is not blocked by high concentrations of 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or alpha-dendrotoxin. We conclude that while inactivation of BK-type Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels contributes to spike broadening in <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> neurons, inactivation of another as yet unidentified outward current also plays a role...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{physical}} encoding of a memory (the engram) {{is a fundamental}} question in neuroscience. Although it has been established that the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala</b> is a key site for encoding associative fear memory, it is currently unclear whether the spatial distribution of neurons encoding a given memory is random or stable. Here we used spatial principal components analysis to quantify the topography of activated neurons, in a select region of the <b>lateral</b> <b>amygdala,</b> from rat brains encoding a Pavlovian conditioned fear memory. Our results demonstrate a stable, spatially patterned organization of amygdala neurons are activated during {{the formation of a}} Pavlovian conditioned fear memory. We suggest that this stable neuronal assembly constitutes a spatial dimension of the engram. © 2011 This is an open-access article distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Public Domain declaration which stipulates that, once placed in the public domain, this work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose...|$|R
