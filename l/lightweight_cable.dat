The inner tension ring, which is made of 8 Ø110 mm full locked coil ropes with a single length of nearly 200 meters, is connected to the outer compression ring by radial cables that consist of full locked coil ropes with Ø110, Ø85, Ø65 and Ø45 mm.|$|E
30|$|Macroscopic fibers {{containing}} only CNTs will yield great advances in high-tech applications (e.g., aerocraft, <b>lightweight</b> <b>cables)</b> {{if they can}} attain the extraordinary mechanical and electrical properties of individual CNTs. This requires that the CNTs in the fibers are sufficiently long, highly aligned, and packed in an arrangement, and is nearly free of defects. Until now, the strategies for assembling CNTs to CFs can be classified into liquid- or solid-state spinning approaches. Liquid-state spinning approaches involve the dispersing of CNTs in a suitable solvent and shaping in coagulation bath. Solid-state spinning approach circumvents the dissolution problem either by drawing a fiber from a vertically grown CNT array or by drawing directly from an aerogel in the furnace [5].|$|R
40|$|Asteroids and comets exert {{such a small}} {{gravitational}} force {{that it is not}} practical to survey them from orbit. One must instead continuously accelerate using maneuvering rockets to move around the surface. A space exploration craft in three parts connected by <b>lightweight</b> <b>cables</b> can survey asteroids and comets, and deploy landers, without requiring the large thrusters and the continuous depletion of fuel required by a single craft. The spacecraft is deployed by spinning up from a compact configuration using low thrust jets, and then maintain surveying orbit without any major expenditure of energy. The triangular tether arrangement is stable, but care must be taken in changing orbits and with deploying and recovering samples, as can be demonstrated with a simple simulation.

40|$|The British Antarctic Survey, in {{collaboration}} with Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l’Environnement, has in recent years successfully drilled to bedrock on three remote sites around the Antarctic Peninsula. Based on the experience from the multi-season project at Berkner Island (948 m depth, 2002 – 05) we optimized the drill set-up to better suit two subsequent single-season projects at James Ross Island (363 m depth, 2008) and Fletcher Promontory (654 m depth, 2012). The adaptations, {{as well as the}} reasons for them, are discussed in detail and include a drill tent set-up without a trench; drilling without a borehole casing with a relatively low fluid column height; and using a shorter drill. These optimizations were aimed at reducing cargo loads and installation time while maintaining good core quality, productivity and a safe working environment. In addition, we introduce a number of innovations, ranging from a new <b>lightweight</b> <b>cable</b> tensioning device and drill-head design to core storage and protection trays. To minimize the environmental impact, all the drill fluid was successfully recovered at both sites and we describe and evaluate this operation...|$|E
40|$|This Report {{describes}} how the electrical power distribution system of a large civil aircraft might be redesigned to employ remote power controllers, embodying solid state protection, in conjunction with solid state logic, to operate circuits remotely through lightweight signal wires. An assessment of the masses of a conventional and a remotely controlled system, based on a VC 10 installation {{in which it is}} assumed that the latest <b>lightweight</b> <b>cables</b> and switchgear are used indicates that the remotely controlled system would be about 90 kg lighter. Additional saving might result from equipment specifically designed to be compatible with solid state remote control techniques. The effect on both systems of resiting the electrical compartment from the forward to a mid-aircraft position has been examined and it is concluded that a further saving of 36 kg would result with remote control. The redesigned system lends itself to, and has been arranged for, easy conversion to multiplexed data transmission. Although a multiplexed system has not been assessed, the mass of cables and fittings that would be replaced ha...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative pass-by system developed to fulfil the ISO 362 -X standards requirements. It {{is open to}} the needs of the NVH field because of its design and software modularity. This system is based on a GPS receiver able to track twenty times per second both the vehicle position and its speed. An in-vehicle module acts as an interface for the driver and gathers several kinds of dynamic data. In the meantime a ground station collects all the information about the acoustical parameters of the pass-by test. A bi-directional high transfer rate data connection via Wireless LAN is established between the in-vehicle unit and the ground station, allowing a real time data transfer of the main parameters. At the end of the test, the main acoustical data and the GPS quality parameters are shown to the driver, that can decide whether to accept or reject the measurement session. The main advantages in using this system are: <b>lightweight,</b> less <b>cables</b> and ease of use if compared with the conventional systems...|$|R
40|$|Although (f) NIRS {{has often}} been cited as {{portable}} and suitable for unconstrained experimental settings, probably most of the NIRS setups employed in neuroscientific research still offer a restrained setting. Typically, the subject is tethered by not very flexible or <b>lightweight</b> fiberoptic <b>cables</b> to {{a more or less}} stationary instrument 1. While restrained settings with a portable but stationary instrument might be well feasible for bedside monitoring, they hamper imaging in a more natural environment, e. g. during sports or physical therapy, or when imaging children. Developments towards miniaturized probe arrays or instruments have been reported before, however, usually at the cost of limited measurement channels or restricted specific portions of the head 2 - 4. We here present a new, miniaturized, portable diffuse optical NIR tomography system that allows brain imaging in freely moving subjects. The performance of the instrument is demonstrated on N= 7 subjects in a hand gripping motor paradigm on a bicycle performed during three conditions: (i) outdoor bicycle riding, (ii) indoor stationary paddling and (iii) rest. NIRS imager and controlling notebook computer were contained in a backpack worn by the subjects. Eight sources and eight detectors were arranged in two groups around positions C 3 and C 4 of the extended international EEG 10 - 20 system to ensure coverage of the primary motor areas of both hemispheres.

(it's an art) With limited funds, he secured a large geiger-mueller tube 18 inches long, one inch in diameter, which was adequate for his thesis experiments.He developed the needed accessory circuits (high-voltage source and amplifiers, all battery-powered, a borrowed mechanical pulse counter, and 400 ft of <b>lightweight,</b> high-voltage twin <b>cable</b> on a portable reel). With this equipment Cook found the effect of height on the gamma ray field from the soil (using flagpoles). He also ran fairly accurate (1.5%) radiation profiles at various heights over several gamma-ray sources: boxes of ore, the Mauch Chunk uranium deposit, and 0.1 gram of pure radium borrowed from a hospital! Heights up to 300 ft. were achieved using 6-foot hydrogen-filled balloons from the Meteorology department to lift the detector, preamplifier and cable. This work occupied much of the Winter and Spring of 1950-51. Cook wrote a careful thesis of over 100 pages, with 29 figures, which wife Vi typed in 3 copies, and was approved by the Committee.|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive, {{lightweight}} array antennas on flexible substrates {{are under}} development {{to satisfy a}} need for large-aperture antennas that can be stored compactly during transport and deployed to full size in the field. Conceived for use aboard spacecraft, antennas of this type also have potential terrestrial uses. most likely, as means to extend the ranges of cellular telephones in rural settings. Several simple deployment mechanisms are envisioned. One example {{is shown in the}} figure, where the deployment mechanism, a springlike material contained in a sleeve around the perimeter of a flexible membrane, is based on a common automobile window shade. The array can be formed of antenna elements that are printed on small sections of semi-flexible laminates, or preferably, elements that are constructed of conducting fabric. Likewise, a distribution network connecting the elements can be created from conventional technologies such as <b>lightweight,</b> flexible coaxial <b>cable</b> and a surface mount power divider, or preferably, from elements formed from conductive fabrics. Conventional technologies may be stitched onto a supporting flexible membrane or contained within pockets that are stitched onto a flexible membrane. Components created from conductive fabrics may be attached by stitching conductive strips to a nonconductive membrane, embroidering conductive threads into a nonconductive membrane, or weaving predetermined patterns directly into the membrane. The deployable antenna may comprise multiple types of antenna elements. For example, thin profile antenna elements above a ground plane, both attached to the supporting flexible membrane, can be used to create a unidirectional boresight radiation pattern. Or, antenna elements without a ground plane, such as bow-tie dipoles, can be attached to the membrane to create a bidirectional array such as that shown in the figure. For either type of antenna element, the dual configuration, i. e., elements formed of slots in a conductive membrane, can also be used. Finally, wide bandwidth antennas or arrays can be formed in which the principal direction of radiation is in the plane of the membrane. For this embodiment, the set of elements on the membrane is arranged to form one or more traveling wave antennas. In this case, a nonconductive form of the perimeter springlike material is required to provide the deploying force...|$|R
40|$|The CBM {{experiment}} is a fixed target experiment {{to be installed}} at the future accelerator facility at GSI/FAIR. It will investigate the properties of nuclear matter at extreme conditions and its underlying strong interaction. The research of the CBM experiment, which focuses on the regime of highest net-baryon densities and moderate temperatures, is complementary to this of the experiments at RHIC/BNL (STAR) and LHC/CERN (ALICE), which mainly focuses on the regime of high energy and zero net-baryon densities. The corresponding conditions in the CBM experiment can be produced in heavy-ion collisions at beam energies between 10 and 40 AGeV. Heavy particles, as e. g. charm carrying particles, could {{be sensitive to the}} properties of the medium in the early phase of the collision. However due to the short lifetime of open charm particles, they can only be reconstructed via their decay products and the corresponding track topology. Consequently in order to reconstruct the decay vertex with a high accuracy an ultrathin detector system with excellent spatial resolution is required. Due to the high particle fluxes expected, additional requirements to the rate capabilities {{as well as to the}} radiation hardness are set. For the precise vertexing a microvertex detector is envisaged, which has to be located directly behind the target and has to operate in the vacuum. Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are the most promising candidates for the underlying sensor technology for the MVD of the CBM experiment. As currently no suited detector is available, substantial research and development is needed in order to meet these requirements. In the context of this thesis first attempts haven been initiated in order to integrate mechanically MAPS sensors into an ultra-thin detector dedicated to the CBM experiment. The mechanical integration necessarily needs to contain the MAPS sensors, electrical services and a support structure to cool and mount the sensors. As, apart from the intrinsic properties of the sensor, the support structures contribute notably to the specific functions and properties of the detector, particular care has to be taken during its development. Its implementation is not meant to push already the limits, rather it is meant to provide an efficient and secure integration solution for MAPS sensors to a detector. In order to not run a risk of failures only state-of the art technologies were used. Thus the ultimate goal, regarding the demands of the CBM experiment, could not be achieved. Based on MAPS MIMOSA- 20 sensors the concept was developed and implemented. MIMOSA- 20 was a prototype sensor available at that time. Although this particular sensors do not meet the I Abstract requirements of the CBM experiment, they could be used for this study. Due to their <b>lightweight</b> construction, flexprint <b>cables</b> have been adapted to the use as electrical interconnection. Flexprint cables comprises thin conducting traces applied on thin kapton foils. For the demonstrator a standard flexprint cable with copper traces was chosen, focusing on electrical properties rather than on the material budget. In this respect only moderate demands on the material budget were made, in order to avoid any risk, related to malfunctions. Since for small areas cooling pipes contribute stronger to the mean material budget, no cooling pipes inside the acceptance were included. Instead highly conducting materials for the support structure were provided, in order to the evacuate the heat to an actively cooled heat sink. In this context synthetic high performance carbon materials turned out to be most suitable. Apart from their high heat conductivity, they essentially provide good rigidity at low material budget. The performance and the dimensioning of the support structure have been evaluated and optimized in consideration of the material budget by means of Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and analytic calculations. As determining factors both the requirements of the CBM experiment and the requirements of the sensors have been accounted for. As the requirements on a temperature profile of MIMOSA- 20 were not known initially, different determining analysis have been conducted. The MVD demonstrator was evaluated and validated by test runs performed in the laboratory and in a beam time at CERN SPS. Thereby the demonstrator setup was characterized extensively and the interplay of the components was studied. By means of the measurements at the beam time the positional stability could be evaluated very accurately. In the course of the systematic evaluation of the measured demonstrator data an extensive ROOT based analysis software was developed. Further on the strength of the systematic evaluation, evaluation approaches and optimization tools in terms of the operation under experimental conditions were concluded. Throughout the development comparison to similar projects were drawn, which could provide suggestions to be considered for the MVD demonstrator...|$|R
