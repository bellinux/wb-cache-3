25|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the zinc–carbon battery {{continued}} to be a popular primary cell battery, but its relatively <b>low</b> <b>battery</b> life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named Lewis Urry, working for Union Carbide at the National Carbon Company Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that alkaline batteries held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting alkaline batteries were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a manganese dioxide cathode and a powdered zinc anode with an alkaline electrolyte. Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries hit the market in 1959.|$|E
500|$|The {{study also}} include hybrid {{electric}} {{vehicles in the}} comparison, and analyzed several scenarios {{to determine how the}} comparative net savings will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase, and also assuming higher fuel efficiency of conventional cars, among other scenarios. Under the future scenarios considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ( [...] to [...] cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very <b>low</b> <b>battery</b> costs and high gasoline prices. The reason for the different savings among PEVs is because BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines. The following table summarizes the results of four of the seven scenarios analyzed by the study.|$|E

2500|$|A study {{published}} in 2011 by the Belfer Center, Harvard University, found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles’ lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices. This finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the U.S. market, and assuming no government subidies. According to the study estimates, a PHEV-40 is [...] more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine, while a battery electric vehicle (BEV) is [...] more expensive. The study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase. Under the future scenarios considered, {{the study found that}} BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ( [...] to [...] cheaper), while PHEVs, [...] will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very <b>low</b> <b>battery</b> costs and high gasoline prices. BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines.|$|E

Phase change materials or PCMs, which have high latent heats, are usually used where high energy absorption {{in a constant}} temperature is required. This work presents a numerical analysis of PCMs effects on cooling Li-ion batteries and their decrease in temperature levels during intense discharge. In this study, three PCM shells with different thermo-physical specifications located around a battery pack is examined.
