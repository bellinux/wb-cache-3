40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hoisting</b> <b>load</b> on {{transverse}} vibrations of hoisting catenaries during lifting in coal mines {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses of the vertical hoisting rope were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect of <b>hoisting</b> <b>load</b> on the transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the <b>hoisting</b> <b>load</b> ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect of <b>hoisting</b> <b>load</b> on transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries.

40|$|Large load {{swing of}} a gantry crane, due to cable {{flexibility}} and rapid movement, {{needs to be}} controlled. Herein, a wave-based approach interprets the cable motion as two superposed traveling waves. To combine position and active swing control, the trolley motion and <b>load</b> <b>hoisting</b> are carefully designed here, and a practical approach is adopted to design hoisting motions in the upward and downward manoeuvres, counteracting their reverse effects on the load swing. A robust control algorithm, based {{on the model of}} the crane system, is proposed to realize the trolley and hoisting motions, allowing for load variations and parameter uncertainties. This new solution to motion control of a gantry crane works very well, and is stable and adaptive to large load variations. As demonstrated in the simulation experiments, it lands the load rapidly and exactly at target and stops it dead, with nearly zero swing...|$|R

40|$|Material {{transportation}} for high-rise building construction {{relies heavily on}} tower cranes. Hence {{the proper use of}} tower cranes is of paramount importance for high-rise residential building construction. In planning and monitoring crane usage in Hong Kong, a schedule is usually prepared to coordinate hoisting operations. Apart from that, little research in optimizing crane usage has been carried out previously, except on operation cycle times, e. g. concreting using a crane and skip and formwork erection. Allocation of time for the hoisting schedule is based on the planners' and operators' experience. The accuracy of the hoisting schedule for crane dominated construction works has significant effects on the materials supply and on concreting operations. Imbalance in the allocation of crane usage for subcontractors may lead to conflicts between trades and idling of workers due to a shortage of materials. Although planners understand that the <b>load</b> <b>hoisting</b> time is proportional to hoisting height and other factors, floor construction cycles usually, for simplicity, are assigned to be constant six day, eight day or ten day cycles without making the necessary compensation for the longer hoisting times for upper floors. The prediction of hoisting times is of great importance to planners to ensure the accuracy of the construction schedule for crane dominated construction. This paper describes the derivation of a mathematical model to predict the hoisting times for a tower crane for public housing construction. Work measurement is used to collect hoisting times data for analysis. Twelve factors considered to influence hoisting time are identified for the model. Multiple regression models are built for predicting supply hoisting times and return hoisting times. The effects of the variables on hoisting time are reviewed. Estimated hoisting times calculated from the models are compared with actual hoisting times, and a worked example illustrating the application of the models is presented.

The lifting operation {{which is one of}} the installation operations includes lifting off, lifting in the air, splash zone crossing, deep submerging, and finally landing of the structure with an offshore support vessel crane.
