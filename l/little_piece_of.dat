[...] "My managers represented {{the guy who was}} directing the film; it was his first film. I saw a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the film, and I had the script. I wrote a theme and I said, 'What if I could get Madonna to write the lyrics for it?'", said Leonard.|$|E

500|$|For his London acts, Leno {{purchased}} {{songs from}} the foremost music hall writers and composers. One such composer was Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes. Other well-known composers of the day who supplied Leno with numbers included Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, Leno commissioned George Le Brunn to compose the incidental music to many of his songs, including [...] "The Detective", [...] "My Old Man", [...] "Chimney on Fire", [...] "The Fasting Man", [...] "The Jap", [...] "All Through A <b>Little</b> <b>Piece</b> <b>of</b> Bacon" [...] and [...] "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also provided the incidental music for three of Leno's best-known songs that depicted life in everyday occupations: [...] "The Railway Guard" [...] (1890), [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] and [...] "The Waiter" [...] (both from 1891). The songs in each piece became instantly distinctive and familiar to Leno's audiences, but his occasional changes to the characterisations kept the sketches fresh and topical.|$|E

500|$|Muir {{suggests}} that the feel of The Day After Tomorrow is [...] "a little more colourful (less minimalist) in colour and costume than Space: 1999s sterling [...] ", with such elements as Wadsworth's [...] "hard-hitting, hard-driving musical score" [...] livening up the proceedings. The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a [...] "dynamic pace", as well as Anderson himself. Muir summarises the final product as a [...] "Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding [...] fashion", and a [...] "time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction". To Law, it is [...] "half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados", but [...] "an interesting look at what might have been" [...] if Anderson {{had been able to}} produce a full series. Mills interprets it as a [...] "solid <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> 70s juvenile sci-fi" [...] that is perhaps [...] "not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E
500|$|In {{his music}} hall acts, Leno created {{characters}} based on observations mostly {{about life in}} London, including , grocer's assistants, beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a fireman and a hairdresser. [...] For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers, including Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes, Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar.

Leno made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, most as himself, and four as an actor. [...] He generally portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle. In An Obstinate Cork (1902), one of Leno's few surviving films, he struggles to pull a cork out of a champagne bottle while on a picnic with his wife Lydia.|$|E

According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back.
