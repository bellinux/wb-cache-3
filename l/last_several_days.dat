The <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> were spent working together with the Senate and the king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, the Senate, and the monarch.

5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E

25|$|Once downed, a {{reindeer}} {{is quickly}} field dressed {{by removing the}} viscera. The skin, head, and viscera are often discarded and left for consumption by foxes, ravens, and other birds. The meat is kept cool to minimize decomposition and protected from blow-flies {{by the use of}} mesh game bags, and any fly eggs (very visible) and maggots are removed immediately. The cool climate makes it possible for the meat to be kept out in the open longer than in warmer climates, therefore a hunting expedition can <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> without a serious loss of meat quality. Once home again, the meat can be hung and aged for a few days before further processing.|$|E
25|$|Rosés can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of rosés means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.|$|E
25|$|Blowing up the {{causeway}} had delayed the Japanese attack {{for over a}} week. Prior to the main assault the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942 Yamashita's heavy guns laid down a barrage of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per tube) along {{the entire length of}} the straits, cutting telephone lines and effectively isolating forward units from rear areas. Even at this stage, a counter artillery barrage as a response could have been mounted by the British on the coastline opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops. But the bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to imminent attack—Malaya Command believed that it would <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> and would later switch its focus to the north-east—despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign, and consequently no order was passed to the Allied artillery units to begin targeting possible Japanese assembly areas.|$|E
