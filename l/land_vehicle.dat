25|$|The Rose-Hulman Human Powered Vehicle Team {{constructs}} a man-powered <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{to compete}} in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Human Powered Vehicle Challenge. The vehicle must be light, highly efficient and powered only by its single occupant. The team at Rose–Hulman is a volunteer engineering club.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1948, a Northrop {{unmanned}} rocket sled {{became the first}} <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> to break the sound barrier. At a military test facility at Muroc Air Force Base (now Edwards AFB), California, it reached a peak speed of 1,019mph (1,640km/h) before jumping the rails.|$|E
50|$|Bucket-wheel {{excavators}} are {{the biggest}} (externally powered) <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> ever built, but do not fit into the popular conception of a landship. The largest self-powered <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> are NASA's two crawler-transporters.|$|R
50|$|Most {{mechanically}} driven <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{can develop}} astern propulsion, although {{in this case}} the ability is more usually termed 'reverse'. In <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> reverse propulsion is usually achieved through various transmission arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Many human-powered <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{can also}} be gravity-powered <b>land</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and vice versa, {{although}} some of the latter are quite awkward to use as the former. For example: street luges, gravity racers, and snow boards.|$|R
25|$|On October 15, 1997, in {{a vehicle}} {{designed}} and built by {{a team led by}} Richard Noble, Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green became the first person to break the sound barrier in a <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> in compliance with Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile rules. The vehicle, called the ThrustSSC ("Super Sonic Car"), captured the record 50 years and one day after Yeager's first supersonic flight.|$|E
25|$|Although the Rotachute concept {{had proved}} to be practical, the {{operational}} requirement for such a machine never materialised. About eight Rotachutes were constructed, most being progressively converted to Mark III and then to Mark IV specifications. They continued to be flown in ground-based and inflight trials until late 1943, to help research flight characteristics for a follow-on project, the Hafner Rotabuggy, an air-towed <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> with autogiro capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} trailhead {{parking lot at}} the top of Platte Clove, {{recently}} expanded by NYSDEC, hikers follow the old Steenburg Road, now the snowmobile trail, blazed both with large orange plastic discs for snowmobiles (rarely seen) and smaller blue ones for foot users (A color given on all DEC lands to sections of the Long Path not part of other designated trails). The cascades of a nearby tributary of Platte Creek beckon through hemlock stands, but are on private <b>land.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> tracks can still be seen as there are several forks leading to private homes in the area, usually chained off. Elevation gain is noticeable, but comes at a slight though steady pace.|$|E
50|$|The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV)—official {{designation}} AAV-P7/A1 (formerly {{known as}} <b>Landing</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> Tracked, Personnel-7 abbr.

The MK4, 7 and 8 teams use dolphins; MK5 uses sea lions, and MK6 uses both sea lions and dolphins. These teams can be deployed at 72 hours' notice by ship, aircraft, helicopter, and <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> to regional conflicts or staging areas around the world.|$|E

50|$|In Autumn 1996 and Spring 1997 the Al-Jafr-desert, {{located near}} Al-Jafr {{in the eastern}} part of the governorate, was the {{location}} of extensive tests of the ThrustSSC, the British-built currently fastest <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the world, which was the first <b>land</b> <b>vehicle</b> to break the sound barrier in October 1997 in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, United States.
