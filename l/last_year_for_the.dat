25|$|This was {{the last}} year of the old style B4U bodykit. There was a special edition model with {{metallic}} green paint, as well as gold rims and pinstriping. It was also the last year that a manual transmission could be ordered as an option. This was also the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> style of dashboard used 1988–1993.|$|E
25|$|For 1983, all Oldsmobile 88s {{received}} new grilles, hood ornaments {{and minor}} trim revisions including new steering wheels.

25|$|By this time, {{the station}} wagon, panel van, and pickup body styles {{had all been}} dropped and 1965 was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greenbrier window van, which was {{retained}} mainly for fleet orders, with 1,528 being built. In all, 235,528 Corvairs were built in 1965.

25|$|Galaxies for {{model year}} 1970 {{received}} minor trim changes. A new ignition lock was {{located on the}} right side of the steering column. Model year 1970 was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> XL, but Galaxie 500 hardtop coupes were also available in both formal-roof and SportsRoof body styles. The optional 4-speed manual transmission, which was available on the 429 the year prior, was dropped for 1970.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 {{model year}} was {{essentially}} a repeat of 1973, {{but it was the}} <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Galaxie 500 name. Ford elected to consolidate most of its full-size models under the popular LTD name for 1975, while reserving the base-model Custom 500 (which was below the Galaxie 500) nameplate for fleet buyers and private customers who insisted on the lowest-priced full-sized model possible. Power front disc brakes were standard.|$|E

25|$|Eventually {{the company}} name was changed to Jo-Han Models because of the already {{existing}} Ideal Toy Company. The new name reflected the first two letters of the founder's first name and the first three letters of his last name.

25|$|In June 1974, {{six years}} into the car's UK introduction, Ford {{announced}} {{the completion of the}} two millionth Ford Escort, a milestone hitherto unmatched by any Ford model outside the US. It was also stated that 60% of the two million Escorts had been built in Britain. In West Germany cars were built at a slower rate of around 150,000 cars per year, slumping to 78,604 in 1974 which was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Escort Mark I. Many of the German built Escorts were exported, notably to Benelux and Italy; from the West German domestic market perspective the car was cramped and uncomfortable when compared with the well-established and comparably priced Opel Kadett, and it was technically primitive when set against the successful imported Fiat 128 and Renault 12. Subsequent generations of the Escort made up some of the ground foregone by the original model, but in Europe's largest auto-market the Escort sales volumes always came in well behind those of the General Motors Kadett and its Astra successor.|$|E

25|$|A {{new body}} style for 1953 was the Skylark convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark {{was one of}} three {{specialty}} convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and the Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick’s 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last wood-bodied station wagon mass-produced in the United States. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137.|$|E
25|$|Game Five old Munster rivals meet in Limerick, The Cork Admirals @ U.L Vikings {{is always}} a game Coach O' Sullivan has pencilled in his diary. Despite a dismal season <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cork team they had bounced back this season rejuvenated, {{recording}} impressive victories, including a 26-0 win over the Rhino's, second seed in the north. The Vikings {{went to work on}} Cork scoring 34 points in the first half, a ten-yard rushing touch down by 2008 and 2009 shamrock bowl M.V.P Adrian Garvey and a spectacular 45 yard touch down pass by the Marc Ashworth / Sean Goldrick unit. The Admirals just could not get the ball moving especially not with the intense pressure coming from the Viking front 4, made up of Alan O' Carroll, Glen Carr, Kieran Coen and this year's d-line addition Ian Cahill who has fitted in comfortably with the three league veterans. Other scores included a 6-yard toss form Ashworth to Curtin and on Craig Switzers first ever offensive play he scored a 75-yard touchdown sweep on his rivals. The second half of the game was a struggle for both teams as it was littered with flags due to the Vikings indiscipline and a defensive stand from the Admirals they were able to control the Vikings and keep them scoreless in the second half, making the second half finish the same as the first 34-0, pushing the Vikings 5-0 record.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics and}} audiences have likened {{the film to}} a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that {{revolves}} around mistaken identity plot devices.

A large set of such fast k–NN search algorithms have been developed during <b>last</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> special case where k = 1.
