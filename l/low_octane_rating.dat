2500|$|... straight-run gasoline, usually {{also called}} naphtha is {{distilled}} directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, its <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> required lead additives. It {{is low in}} aromatics (depending on the grade of crude oil), containing some cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and no olefins (alkenes). Between 0 and 20% of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline, because the supply of this fraction is insufficient and its RON is too low. The chemical properties (namely octane and RVP) of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerisation. However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split in light and heavy naphtha. Straight-run gasoline can be also used as a feedstock into steam-crackers to produce olefins.|$|E
50|$|Where fuel {{quality is}} <b>low</b> and <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> is poor, {{compression}} ratios will be restricted. In these cases, the sidevalve engine still {{has much to}} offer. Particularly {{in the case of}} the developed IOE engine for a market with poor fuels, engines such as Rolls-Royce B series or the Land-Rover use a complicated arrangement of inclined valves, a cylinder head line at an angle to the bore and corresponding angled pistons to provide a compact combustion chamber approaching the near-hemispherical ideal. Such engines remained in production into the 1990s, only being finally replaced when the fuels available 'in the field' became more likely to be diesel than petrol.|$|R
50|$|Petrol/gasoline {{engines are}} limited in the variety {{and quality of the}} fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a {{carburetor}} required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary air-fuel ratio for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the compression ratio of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too <b>low</b> an <b>octane</b> <b>rating),</b> the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels. There has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and ethanol, petrol and propane, and petrol and methane.|$|R
5000|$|In some countries, {{pumps are}} able to mix two fuel {{products}} together before dispensing; this {{is referred to as}} blending or mixing. Typical usages are in a [...] "mix" [...] pump to add oil to petrol for two-stroke motorcycles, to produce an intermediate <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> from separate high and <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> fuels, or to blend hydrogen and compressed natural gas (HCNG). The benefit of blending for retailers is that it allows them to offer 3 grades of fuel while only having to maintain inventory of two grades. This frees up both working capital and tank capacity and improves fuel turnover.|$|R

One component of this ISOM site was a unit called the raffinate splitter. When operational, this 170-foot (50 m) tall tower was used to separate out lighter hydrocarbon components {{from the top of}} the tower (mainly pentane and hexane), which condensed and were then pumped to the light raffinate storage tank, while the heavier components were recovered lower down in the splitter, then pumped to a heavy raffinate storage tank.

50|$|Though Coleman fuel has an {{octane rating}} of 50 to 55 and a {{flammability}} similar to gasoline, it {{has none of}} the additives found in modern gasoline {{and should not be}} used as a substitute for gasoline. While it will function as a fuel for gasoline engines, its high combustion temperature and lack of octane boosting additives could damage engine valves, while its <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> and lack of anti-knock agents can produce knocking that could lead to bearing and piston rod damage, so such use should only be considered for emergencies and/or very short distances. And like gasoline, it should not be used as a substitute for kerosene or diesel fuel. However, it is quite popular as a fuel for model engines, where the <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> is not a problem, additives are unwanted, and the clean burning, low odor and longer shelf life are considered advantages.|$|E

New Zealand's unleaded petrol was of a <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating,</b> meaning that initially only uncatalyzed cars were on offer. In January 1994, the ZX estate debuted and went on sale in May, shortly followed by a mid cycle facelift.|$|E

The petroleum nut (P. resiniferum) yields petroleum nut oil, which is sometimes proposed as biofuel; due to its excessive n-heptane content and consequent <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating,</b> it is better suited {{as a source of}} n-heptane, which is otherwise produced from crude oil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> was {{originally}} determined by mixing a gasoline made entirely of heptane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (a highly branched octane), and assigning anti-knock ratings of 0 for pure heptane and 100 for pure 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. The anti-knock rating of this mixture {{would be the}} same as the percentage of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane in the mix. Modern octane ratings of gasoline are given octane ratings equal to those from this original heptane/octane scale. Different isomers of octane can contribute to a higher or lower <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b> For example, n-octane (the straight chain of 8 carbon atoms with no branching) has a -10 (negative) <b>octane</b> <b>rating,</b> while pure 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (a highly branched octane) has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 100. Some fuels have an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> higher than 100, notably those containing methanol or ethanol.|$|R
5000|$|The Penex process uses fixed-bed {{catalysts}} containing chlorides. [...] A {{single pass}} of feedstock with an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 50-60 {{through such a}} bed typically produces an end product rated at 82-86. If the feedstock is subsequently passed through a DIH (deisohexanizer) column, the end product typically has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 87-90.5. If the feedstock is subsequently passed through a Molex-technology column, the end product typically has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 88-91. If the feedstock is first passed through a DIP (deisopentanizer) column to remove iso-pentanes, then through the Penex bed, and subsequently through the DIH column, the end product typically has an <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of 91-93.|$|R
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{substitute}} for petrol, TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly used as a domestic heating fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> and would damage an engine built for petrol. The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from what is now sold as heating oil. These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back {{in a controlled manner}} into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70.|$|E
50|$|The Austin A40 Somerset saloon's {{reputation}} for being somewhat slow and lumbering to drive is not wholly deserved. It had to endure poor-quality petrol supplies in 1952, and in consequence had retarded ignition settings to tolerate the <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of the fuels available to avoid the engine knocking or 'pinging' condition that was well known in those times. In fact British Motor Corporation later produced a kit to improve the performance and fuel consumption of these cars once premium fuel supplies resumed under the popular petrol brands. This kit comprised a replacement distributor and an optional cylinder head gasket that was thinner and therefore raised the compression slightly from the standard 7.2:1.|$|E
50|$|The first tractor {{models of}} 1947 were built for petrol fuel. In 1949 {{versions}} of the engine using TVO, and in 1950 lamp oil were introduced. TVO has a <b>low</b> <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> of around 60 and so the engine had the usual changes to compression ratio and ignition timing. A heat shield around the manifolds increased the inlet temperature, encouraging vapourisation of the fuel. To avoid problems with fuel condensation in the inlet ports, diameter of the valves (in some engine versions) was also reduced, thus increasing flow velocity. The lamp oil engine used a zero octane paraffin (kerosene) fuel, but was only suitable for use in warm climates, or else the fuel did not vapourise adequately.|$|E

50|$|Liquid {{gasoline}} {{itself is}} not actually burned, but its fumes ignite, causing the remaining liquid to evaporate and then burn. Gasoline is extremely volatile and easily combusts, making any leakage potentially extremely dangerous. Gasoline sold in most countries carries a published <b>octane</b> <b>rating.</b> The <b>octane</b> number is an empirical measure of the resistance of gasoline to combusting prematurely, known as knocking. The higher the <b>octane</b> <b>rating,</b> the more resistant the fuel is to autoignition under high pressures, which allows for a higher compression ratio. Engines with a higher compression ratio, commonly used in race cars and high-performance regular-production automobiles, can produce more power; however, such engines require a higher octane fuel. Increasing the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> has, in the past, been achieved by adding 'anti-knock' additives such as lead-tetra-ethyl. Because of {{the environmental impact of}} lead additives, the <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> is increased today by refining out the impurities that cause knocking.|$|R
50|$|The <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> {{of a given}} fuel is {{a measure}} of the fuel's {{resistance}} to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical <b>octane</b> <b>rating</b> allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.|$|R
