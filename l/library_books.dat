5|$|While {{the library}} {{building}} {{dates to the}} early 20th century the move toward intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, though it had no building of its own. Before the library had its own building, <b>library</b> <b>books</b> were stored in a drug store {{and then in the}} County Treasurer's office. Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank building. This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} {{spend a lot}} of time at IUT Library and Documentation Centre. It is on the first floor of the Library/Cafeteria building overlooking a lake on the eastern and western sides. The library has a floor area of 1300 sq. meters with a shelf space of 52,000 books. It is divided into two sections, General and Research/Reference. To conduct the IUT Library service, a customised software was developed and installed. The CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) department developed a new software for library management which is accessible through computers and cell phones. The data of projects/thesis/dissertations have been incorporated in the software. Now the faculty members and the students may search their desired books/dissertation from OPAC (On-line Public Access Catalogue). Local Area Network (LAN) in the IUT campus. There are 26,200 books on engineering, technical and vocational subjects. 20 technical journals are being subscribed from abroad annually. It is an open-shelf <b>library.</b> <b>Books</b> are issued to the students and staff for home use. It is open from 8.00am to 10.00pm on all working days and on one weekend 2.00pm. to 10.00pm.|$|E
25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no <b>library</b> <b>books),</b> writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E
