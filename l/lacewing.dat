5|$|Larvae {{of other}} Chrysomelids are predated by birds, coccinellids, predatory bugs, <b>lacewing</b> larvae, syrphid larvae, carabids, ants, wasps, spiders and harvestmen, {{all of which}} are common on the tansy around the York population. The pupal stage may be {{directly}} predated by the European mole.|$|E
5|$|At least {{thirteen}} insect genera, three spider families, one phalangid (Opiliones), and one mite {{have been}} recorded as predators of the varying stages of L. decemlineata. These include the ground beetle Lebia grandis, the Coccinellid beetles Coleomegilla maculata and Hippodamia convergens, the Shield bugs Perillus bioculatus and Podisus maculiventris, as well as various species of the <b>lacewing</b> genus Chrysopa, the wasp genus Polistes, and the damsel bug genus Nabis.|$|E

25|$|Agents of {{biological}} control include {{a number of}} parasitoid wasps that attack the nymphs, including Leptomastidea abnormis, Leptomastix dactylopii, Chrysoplatycerus splendens, and Anagyrus pseudococci. Predators include the brown <b>lacewing</b> Sympherobius barberi, the green <b>lacewing</b> Chrysopa lateralis, hoverfly larvae, and the scale-feeding snout-moth larva. The mealybug destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), a ladybird beetle, readily attacks the citrus mealybug.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of Southern Television in 1981, Hargreaves teamed up with <b>Lacewing</b> Productions, a small company founded by David Knowles (ex-Southern Television). <b>Lacewing,</b> based in Winchester, were {{commissioned}} by Channel 4, via Limehouse Productions in London, to make a series similar to Out of Town. Setting up a studio – complete with the original shed set from Southern Television – in the village hall at Meonstoke Hampshire, Jack worked with Steve Wade, Phil Wade and Steve Wagstaff (location cameraman), {{to create a new}} version of Out of Town called Old Country. <b>Lacewing</b> produced a total of sixty Old Country episodes, broadcast nationally on Channel 4 between 1983 and 1985.|$|E
25|$|The green <b>lacewing</b> adults overwinter {{buried in}} leaf litter {{at the edge}} of fields or other rough places, {{emerging}} when the weather warms up in spring. Each female <b>lacewing</b> lays several hundred small eggs at the rate of two to five per day, choosing concealed spots underneath leaves or on shoots near potential prey. The eggs are normally laid during the hours of darkness.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} natural enemies exist. One survey in Egypt noted 12 species of {{parasitoid}} wasps on the citrus mealybug. It also recorded nine predatory insects, including ladybird beetles, moths, a gall midge, {{and a green}} <b>lacewing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil <b>lacewing</b> (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard <b>lacewing</b> (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea, {{known as}} the common green <b>lacewing,</b> is an insect in the Chrysopidae family. It is found {{in many parts of}} America, Europe and Asia. Although the adults feed on nectar, pollen and aphid honeydew, the larvae are active predators and feed on aphids and other small insects. It has been used in the {{biological}} control of insect pests on crops.|$|E
25|$|The Polyjuice Potion {{allows the}} drinker {{to assume the}} {{appearance}} of someone else {{for an hour or}} more depending on the quantity. The potion only causes a physical transformation of the drinker, but clothing and voice is not affected. Its ingredients include fluxweed, knotgrass, <b>lacewing</b> flies, leeches, powdered Bicorn horn, and shredded Boomslang skin. The final component is a bit of the individual to be impersonated; strands of hair are most often used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|The green <b>lacewing</b> {{eggs are}} oval and secured {{to the plant}} by long slender stalks. They are pale green when first laid but become gray later. The larvae are about one {{millimetre}} long when they first hatch. They are brown and resemble small alligators, crawling actively around in search of prey. They have a pair of pincer-like mandibles on their head with which they grasp their prey, sometimes lifting the victim off the leaf surface to prevent its escape. The larvae inject enzymes into the bodies of their victims which digest the internal organs, after which they suck out the liquidated body fluids. The larvae grow to about eight millimetres long before they spin circular cocoons and pupate.|$|E
2500|$|MorphoBank {{hosts the}} {{products}} of peer-reviewed scientific research on phenotypes. An increasing volume of systematics data is [...] "born digital" [...] and MorphoBank is well suited to handle this type of material. In August 24, 2007, 62 active research projects were hosted by MorphoBank, as well as 6 completed (and published) projects. By 2017 over 2000 scientists and their students were registered content builders (users {{are not required to}} register and are even more numerous) and has more than 500 publicly available projects with approximately 80,000 images that are {{the products of}} scientific research. Over 1,500 active research projects are hosted by MorphoBank. The software has been used to assemble phylogenetic research on such groups as mammals, from bats [...] to whales, bivalve molluscs, arachnids, fossil plants and living and extinct amniotes. It has also been used more broadly in evolutionary and paleontological research to host curated images associated with published research on <b>lacewing</b> insects geckos, raptor birds, dinosaurs, frogs and nematodes.|$|E
