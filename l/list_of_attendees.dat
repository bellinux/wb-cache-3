25|$|A fourth attempt {{came from}} the state of Virginia. Former President John Tyler, a private citizen of Virginia who was still much {{interested}} in the fate of the nation, had been appointed as a special Virginia envoy to President James Buchanan to urge him {{to maintain the status quo}} in regard to the seceded states. Later, Tyler was an elected delegate to the Virginia convention called to consider whether or not to follow the Deep South states out of the Union. Tyler thought that a final collective effort should be made to preserve the Union and in a document published on January 17, 1861, he called for a convention of the six free and six slave border states to resolve the sectional split. Governor John Letcher of Virginia had already made a similar request to the state legislature, agreed to sponsor the convention while the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>attendees</b> to all of the states was expanded.

The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>attendees</b> by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event.

50|$|In 697 a Mordail or General Convention {{was held}} in Birr, County Offaly in order to draw up laws for all Ireland. About 91 rulers of Church and State {{attended}}. Forty churchmen attended {{and the president of}} the synod and name at the top of the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>attendees</b> and guarantors was Fland Feblae, which points to Fland being recognized as the head of the Irish church. Armagh then followed the Roman custom of fixing the date of Easter but the community of Iona under Saint Adomnán still followed the Irish tradition of fixing the date. Adomnán also attended the synod and by allowing Fland Feblae to be president it was seen as an acknowledgement that Armagh held the primacy of Ireland and not Iona. The High-King of Ireland Loingsech mac Óengusso and 50 other chiefs also attended the synod. At the Synod Adomnán proposed the “Law of the Innocents” or Cáin Adomnáin which protected women, children and clergy from attack.|$|E

5000|$|Owain {{may also}} have participated in an {{assembly}} of kings with Æthelstan, King of the Anglo-Saxons (died 939) in 927. According to the [...] "D" [...] version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the meeting took place at , and was attended by Æthelstan, the Welsh king Hywel Dda (died 949/950), Custantín, Owain ap Hywel, King of Gwent (died c.930), and Ealdred. According to the twelfth-century Gesta regum Anglorum, an assembly took place at Dacre, an ecclesiastical centre near the River Eamont. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>attendees</b> in this source {{differs from that of}} the chronicle in the fact that Owain himself is listed instead of Owain ap Hywel. In fact, the assemblies may well refer to the same event, and it is not unlikely that both men were present. Whatever the case, Owain's involvement may have concerned support rendered to Gofraid ua Ímair (died 934), a man who temporarily seized the kingship of York in 927 before being driven out within the year by Æthelstan. According to Gesta regum Anglorum, Gofraid had been forced from York into Scotia, whereupon Æthelstan summoned the Cumbrian and Scottish kings to the assembly.|$|E

In 1953, Uphaus and his wife Ola became {{the directors of the}} World Fellowship Center, a summer conference and retreat center in Albany, New Hampshire. It was there in 1954, amidst the height of McCarthyism, that he was pressured by New Hampshire Attorney General Louis Wyman to surrender a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> all <b>attendees</b> <b>of</b> World Fellowship Center. Uphaus voluntariily met with Wyman several times in 1954 in a futile attempt to clarify that he had never officially been a member of any explicitly Communist party, but the attorney remained firm in his demand that Uphaus produce a list that included the addresses and contact information <b>of</b> all <b>attendees,</b> speakers, and employees at World Fellowship. To this Uphaus steadfastly refused; in January 1956, was subpoenaed to produce such list or face time in jail. After several appeals, Uphaus was sentenced to a year in jail on December 14, 1959, for contempt of court. In 1961, Uphaus resumed his directorship position at World Fellowship, authored an autobiography entitled Commitment in 1963 and retired in 1969. During the 1970s he divided his time between New Haven, Connecticut, and St. Petersburg, Florida. He died at age 92 on October 5, 1983, in New Haven.|$|R
