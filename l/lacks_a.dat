5|$|When {{collected}} in its typical habitat {{and during the}} appropriate season, Tricholoma vernaticum mushrooms can be readily identified because of their prominent characteristics: white color, stocky fruit body, farinaceous odor, and ring on the stipe. Tricholoma lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. T.portentosum has a gray cap, a stipe with yellow tints, and <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> ring, while T.mutabile has violet tones in its cap and also <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> ring. Other lookalikes include Hygrophorus subalpinus and H.camarophyllus, but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic odor of T.vernaticum.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To examine {{why people}} <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> regular source of {{ambulatory}} care (RSAC) and explore whether this commonly used access measure accurately identifies population subgroups {{at risk for}} barriers to continuity care. METHODS: Using data from a 1986 national telephone survey, we performed a content analysis of subjects' verbatim reports {{as to why they}} <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (n = 5, 748). RESULTS: The 16. 4 percent of respondents who <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> RSAC gave the following reasons: 1) financial problems, 8 percent; 2) local resource inaccessibility, 5 percent; 3) not wanting a regular source of ambulatory care, 61 percent; and 4) transitory loss of their regular source of ambulatory care, 18 percent. However, some sociodemographic subgroups reported substantially more problems with access barriers, and these disparities were often not detected by the global measure, RSAC. The poor were not more likely than the non-poor to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval, [0. 6, 1. 1]), but {{were much more likely to}} <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC for financial reasons (OR = 5. 2 [2. 6, 10. 6]). Similarly, rural respondents were not more likely than urban dwellers to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC, but were more likely to <b>lack</b> <b>an</b> RSAC because of local resource inaccessibility (OR = 5. 8 [2. 8, 11. 9]). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the global measure, RSAC, is not an accurate indicator of whether population subgroups have access barriers to obtaining a source of continuity care...|$|R

5|$|Hygrophorus pustulatus resembles H.agathosmus and has {{a similar}} almond odor. However, the fruit bodies of H.pustulatus are smaller, and it {{produces}} larger spores (11–14µm long). Hygrophorus occidentalis, which grows under conifers or oak, has a sticky stem and less pronounced almond odor. Hygrophorus marzuolus is also similar in appearance, but it <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> distinctive odor, and has smaller spores than H.agathamosus.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates from seed.|$|E

5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
