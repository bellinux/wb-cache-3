40|$|For {{multi-line}} insurance companies, allocating {{the risk}} capital to each {{line is a}} widely-accepted risk management exercise. In this article we consider several applications of the Euler capital allocation. First, we propose visual tools to present the diversification and the line-wise performance for a given <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio</b> so that the risk managers can understand the interactions among the lines. Secondly, on theoretical side, we prove that the Euler allocation is the directional derivative of the marginal or incremental allocation method, an alternative capital allocation rule in the literature. Lastly, we establish the equivalence between the mean-shortfall optimization and the RORAC optimization when the risk adjusted capital is the expected shortfall, and show how to construct the optimal insurance business mix that maximizes the portfolio RORAC.

40|$|Reinsurance {{is often}} empirically {{hailed as a}} value-adding risk {{management}} strategy which an insurer can utilize to achieve various business objectives. In {{the context of a}} distortion-risk-measure-based three-party model incorporating a policyholder, insurer and reinsurer, this article formulates explicitly the optimal insurance–reinsurance strategies {{from the perspective of the}} insurer. Our analytic solutions are complemented by intuitive but scientifically rigorous explanations on the marginal cost and benefit considerations underlying the optimal insurance–reinsurance decisions. These cost-benefit discussions not only cast light on the economic motivations for an insurer to engage in insurance with the policyholder and in reinsurance with the reinsurer, but also mathematically formalize the value created by reinsurance with respect to stabilizing the <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio</b> and enlarging the underwriting capacity of an insurer. Our model also allows for the reinsurer’s failure to deliver on its promised indemnity when the regulatory capital of the reinsurer is depleted by the reinsured loss. The reduction in the benefits of reinsurance to the insurer as a result of the reinsurer’s default is quantified, and its influence on the optimal insurance–reinsurance policies analyzed...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{properties}} of the KMV model of credit <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss.</b> This theoretical model constitutes the cornerstone of Basel II’s Internal Ratings Based(IRB) approach to regulatory capital. Our results show that this model tends to overestimate the probability of <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> when the probability of default of a single firm and the firms’ asset correlations are low. On the contrary, probabilities of <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> are underestimated when the probability of default of a single firm and asset correlations are high. Moreover, the relationship between asset correlation and probability of loan <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> is only consistent at very high quantiles of the <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> distribution.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that, {{in the absence of}} a trading market for loss reserves, a reasonable estimate of the “fair value ” of unpaid losses is the risk-free present value of an unbiased estimate of those losses plus a market-based risk margin. If the risk margin is defined as the risk-free present value of the market-clearing cost of the capital required to support the unpaid losses during the run-off period, the size of the risk margin depends on the amount of required capital. Existing literature shows how to calculate the risk margin in cases where the amount of required capital is specified exogenously. However, the European Solvency II directive defines the capital requirement as of any given date as an endogenous variable equal to the amount needed to ensure solvency over a one-year time horizon with 99. 5 % confidence. This paper derives and illustrates an integrated framework for quantifying the required capital, the implied cost-of-capital-based risk margin and the fair value reserve from the expected volatility, payment and other characteristics of an unpaid <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio</b> consistent with the Solvency II standard. The conceptual framework presented has application to both fair value reserving and economic capital modeling...|$|E
40|$|We develop {{quantile}} {{regression models}} {{in order to}} derive risk margin and to evaluate capital in non-life insurance applications. By utilizing {{the entire range of}} conditional quantile functions, especially higher quantile levels, we detail how quantile regression is capable of providing an accurate estimation of risk margin and an overview of implied capital based on the historical volatility of a general insurers <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Two modelling frameworks are considered based around parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models which we develop specifically in this insurance setting. In the parametric quantile regression framework, several models including the flexible generalized beta distribution family, asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution and power Pareto distribution are considered under a Bayesian regression framework. The Bayesian posterior quantile regression models in each case are studied via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies. In the nonparametric quantile regression framework, that we contrast to the parametric Bayesian models, we adopted an AL distribution as a proxy and together with the parametric AL model, we expressed the solution as a scale mixture of uniform distributions to facilitate implementation. The models are extended to adopt dynamic mean, variance and skewness and applied to analyze two real loss reserve data sets to perform inference and discuss interesting features of quantile regression for risk margin calculations...|$|E
40|$|The bias of the {{empirical}} estimate {{of a given}} risk measure has recently been {{of interest in the}} risk management literature. In particular, Kim and Hardy (2007) showed that the bias can be corrected for the Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE, a. k. a. Tail-VaR or Expected Shortfall) using the bootstrap. This article extends their result to the distortion risk measure (DRM) class where the CTE is a special case. In particular, through the exact bootstrap, it is analytically proved that the bias of {{the empirical}} estimate of DRM with concave distortion function is negative and can be corrected on the bootstrap, using the fact that the bootstrapped loss is majorized by the original loss vector. Since the class of DRM is a subset of the L-estimator class, the result provides a sufficient condition for the bootstrap bias correction for L-estimators. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the bootstrap bias correction. Later a practical guideline to choose the estimate with a lower mean squared error is also proposed based on the analytic form of the double bootstrapped estimate, which can be useful in estimating risk measures where the bias is non-cumulative across <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Exact bootstrap Bias correction Distortion risk measure Majorization Conditional tail expectation...|$|E

The findings of this study lend empirical support to the belief that the magnitude of efficiency losses for household investors differs with the different demographic characteristics and investment propensities. In particular, household investors with long-investment horizons, with more autonomy of choices in their SDAs, or with the tendency to select high levels of portfolio risk in SDAs are more vulnerable to efficiency losses. Factors to predict the levels of portfolio risk maintained by household investors in their SDAs are also explored.

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{the foreign}} exchange (FX) rates {{are a source of}} additional risk, but also an opportunity for further profits for internationally operating reinsurers. A DFA model that includes FX rates can be a means for measuring the potential impact of FX rate fluctuations on portfolios of ceded reinsurance and internationally invested assets. Moreover, such a DFA model can also be a means for testing different strategies for managing FX risk. We start by surveying the empirical properties of FX rate data and introduce some simple approaches for generating FX scenarios. We then study the different ways in which reinsurers are exposed to FX risk, and possible strategies for managing these risks. The emphasis is on so-called on-balance sheet currency hedging techniques, i. e. on offsetting FX risks on reinsurance contracts by investing appropriate amounts of money in the respective foreign currency. The theoretical reasonings are accompanied by a DFA study on an international <b>loss</b> <b>portfolio.</b> This study shows that FX fluctuations can {{have an impact on the}} reinsurer's business, and that the optimal strategy may not be a full hedge depending on the type of business and on the economic circumstances.

Version: FinalIn 2010, the Managing Authority (MA) in Malta launched the first Financial Engineering Instrument (FEI) under Cohesion policy, taking the form of a loan guarantee scheme entitled the JEREMIE First <b>Loss</b> <b>Portfolio</b> Guarantee Product. This addresses a “financing gap” in Malta wherein enterprises, particularly micro and small, face difficulties in obtaining the necessary financing from banks due to their above-average credit risk and lack of collateral. The JEREMIE scheme utilises funds under Operational Programme (OP) I, Priority Axis (PA) 1 entitled “Enhancing Knowledge and Innovation”, and comprises a holding fund of EUR 10 million to be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The current banking structure in Malta makes such forms of FEIs particularly successful. The JEREMIE scheme is currently the only FEI financed through ERDF in Malta. Although this is true, FEIs, financed through local funds, are not new to the Maltese economy. Unlike loan guarantee schemes, however, not all FEIs have proven to be suitable to the local economy. Venture Capital (VC) funds, for instance, are not economically viable for small ventures that are not engaged in cutting edge innovation. The local authorities realize that although FEIs may effectively generate growth potential for SMEs, non-refundable assistance is still necessary given Malta’s economic structure. Prior to EU accession, non-refundable assistance mainly took the form of tax credits which have been highly successful in retaining investment in Malta as well as attracting new investors to operate locally. Upon EU membership, through improved Community funding opportunities, Malta was better able to diversify its portfolio of assistance to industry and began to offer other forms of nonrefundable assistance, mainly grants. These may be more useful in helping businesses that need imminent and short-term assistance, such as start-ups and micro businesses. Since this type of assistance was lacking prior to EU accession, the authorities have focussed more of their resources on non-refundable assistance in the current programming period under OP IN/...|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} capital {{necessary}} to support a portfolio of debt securities depends on the probability distribution of the <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss.</b> Consider a <b>portfolio</b> of loans, {{each of which is}} subject to default resulting in a loss to the lender. Suppose the portfolio is financed partly by equity capital and partly by borrowed funds. The credit quality of the lender's notes will depend on the probability that the <b>loss</b> on the <b>portfolio</b> exceeds the equity capital. To achieve a certain credit rating of its notes (say Aa on a rating agency scale), the lender needs to keep the probability of default on the notes at the level corresponding to that rating (about. 001 for the Aa quality). It means that the equity capital allocated to the portfolio must be equal to the percentile of the distribution of the <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> that corresponds to the desired probability. In addition to determining the capital necessary to support a loan portfolio, the probability distribution of <b>portfolio</b> <b>losses</b> has a number of other applications. It can be used in regulatory reporting, measuring portfolio risk, calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), portfolio optimization and structuring and pricing debt portfolio derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations (CDO).

40|$|We model {{aggregate}} credit <b>losses</b> {{on large}} <b>portfolios</b> of financial positions contracted with firms subject to both cyclical default correlation and direct default contagion processes.

40|$|This thesis studies {{an asset}} {{value-based}} approach for the valuation of credit portfolio risk including the estimation and the backtesting of the model’s forecasting ability. On {{the basis of}} the credit valuation model proposed by Black and Cox (1976) an asset value-based factor model for the forecasting of credit portfolio risk is suggested. The model includes credit losses from the default of obligors as well as negative changes of credits’ mark-to-model values. Using market prices of defaultable corporate bonds a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of the state-space models of systematic factors and asset values of risk classes is performed. The backtesting procedure assesses the forecasting ability of the credit portfolio model using three zones of credit <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> that are defined analogously to the regulatory backtesting of internal market risk models. Probability distributions of credit <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> are simulated and the backtesting zones of <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> are compared for different credit portfolios and different variations of the backtesting procedure, the model structure and the parameters. The results show that for typical levels of confidence and typical time horizons the Credit-VaR exceeds banks’ capital considerably. Furthermore, backtesting zones of credit <b>portfolio</b> <b>loss</b> that fit to banks’ capital levels result in a level of test significance that is distinctly lower than in the backtesting of market risk models. It is concluded that the revised capital requirements set by the Basel Committee do not prevent credit <b>portfolio</b> <b>losses</b> exceeding banks’ capital with the statistical confidence presumed by supervisory authorities...|$|R
