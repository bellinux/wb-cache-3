50|$|The Lacquer Channel Mastering {{facility}} was in house at Phase One Studios up until 1989, {{when they moved}} to another location. At that time Studio B was torn down and moved into the space where the <b>original</b> <b>Lacquer</b> Channel stood.|$|R
50|$|After {{extensive}} restoration, started February 2008, Ginkaku-ji {{is again}} in full glory to visit. The garden and temple complex {{are open to}} the public. There is still no silver foil used. After much discussion, it was decided to not refinish the <b>lacquer</b> to the <b>original</b> state. The <b>lacquer</b> finish was the source of the original silver appearance of the temple, with the reflection of silver water of the pond on the lacquer finish.|$|R
50|$|Shulman’s latest {{photographs}} offer {{a unique}} {{glimpse into the}} precision of Koenig’s restoration. Although Koenig’s completed house is nearly exact to the original design, subtle changes are present. Among these are a slightly altered tiling layout for the inner courtyard wall and a more elaborate fountain mechanism below. The can-like lights that are present throughout the space {{appear to have a}} darkened patina applied as compared to the <b>original</b> <b>lacquered</b> fixtures. Additionally, Cracchiolo apparently requested the introduction of semi-translucent glass on the bathroom walls for increased privacy.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2017 a {{three part}} story about Lyn Stanley's sound {{recording}} career and her 2017 releases of The Moonlight Sessions Volumes One and Two {{was released by}} Part Time Audiophile's writer John Stancavage. [...] Stanley announced the release date of May 30, 2017 for The Moonlight Sessions Volume One in two formats—double vinyl 45RPM—Special Limited Edition using the One Step pressing process. This vinyl pressing process was popular in the 1950s before mass production of vinyl records was needed to meet demand. The One Step vinyl album uses the <b>original</b> <b>lacquer</b> to create the Father or Master stamper. Typically most vinyl records are made with the Three Step process whereby Father, Mother and Stampers are all created from one lacquer, hence three steps from the original. The One step process is one step from the <b>original</b> <b>lacquer</b> and therefore closer to the master tape/tracks. The Moonlight Sessions Volumes One and Two were recorded in February 2017 by Al Schmitt and Steve Genewick. Mixing Engineer was Michael Bishop of Five/Four Productions and the album was mastered by Bernie Grundman of Bernie Grundman Mastering. The musicians on this project include pianists Mike Garson, Christian Jacob and Tamir Hendelman; bassist Chuck Berghofer; guitar by John Chiodini; drummers include Joe La Barbara, Bernie Dresel, and Ray Brinker. Soloists: Hendrik Meurkens, Rickey Woodard, Chuck Findley and Corky Hale and Carol Robins. All vocals by Lyn Stanley.|$|R
50|$|Wet {{cleaning}} is {{the process}} of further removal of dirt, grime and residue {{from the surface of the}} object that is not successfully removed by dry cleaning. Testing of various solvents should be done prior to wet cleaning the surface of the object in order to prevent possible damage to or removal of the <b>original</b> <b>lacquer</b> surface. Aqueous solvents with different PH levels will have varying levels of success in the removal of dirt and grime from the surface of the lacquer, and have various levels of risk of damaging the surface. This also depends on the condition of the object prior to cleaning. Nonpolar solvents are less likely to damage surfaces that have been photodegradad.|$|R
50|$|Warner's {{retained}} Andy Pratt Film Labs who {{in conjunction}} with Eastman Kodak developed a method to remove the cracked and fading to brown, clear <b>lacquer</b> from the <b>original</b> 65 mm Technicolor negative. Warners did nothing further to restore the negative. Due to costs of making a 70 mm release print even without magnetic striping, using DTS disk for audio, there are no immediate plans for any new prints. The 65 mm roadshow print negative {{was used for the}} DVD release. Had any 35 mm Anamorphic elements been used the aspect ratio would have been 2.35:1. Mike Todd had limited 35 mm anamorphic prints made with a non-standard compression ratio to provide a 2.21:1 viewing experience. These special 35 mm prints are called Cinestage, the same name of Mike Todd's showcase theatre in Chicago.|$|R

[...] The original cast album was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress on March 21, 2013 for long-term preservation. The film soundtrack was released on the RCA Victor label in March 1958. [...] Kenrick calls the recording [...] "mixed up" [...] and does not recommend it.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{naturally}} occurring acidic lacquer polysaccharide with glucuronic acid at the terminals {{of the complex}} branches has specific biological activities including promotion of blood coagulation and antitumor activities. The polysaccharide has two molecular weight fractions M¯n= 10 × 104 and M¯n= 3. 0 × 104. In the present work, two pure fractions were isolated {{for the first time}} by Sephadex G- 100 column chromatography. Then, each fraction was treated with diluted alkaline solution to decrease the molecular weights to M¯n= 3. 0 × 104 and M¯n= 1. 4 × 104, respectively. The NMR and IR spectra and specific rotations of the fractionated and <b>original</b> <b>lacquer</b> polysaccharides were almost identical, suggesting that the lacquer polysaccharides are an associated structure with several low molecular weight polysaccharides of M¯n= 1. 4 × 104. Interactions between each lacquer polysaccharide and poly-l-lysine, a model compound of proteins and peptides with positively-charged amino groups, were investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to elucidate the biological mechanism. The apparent dissociation-rate (kd), association-rate (ka), and dissociation constant (KD) obtained by SPR indicate that the lacquer polysaccharides had weaker interactions with poly-l-lysine than sulfated polysaccharides and that the interaction depended on the molecular weight. These SPR results suggest that the specific biological activities of lacquer polysaccharides originate from electrostatic interaction...|$|R
40|$|Lacquer polysaccharides, which {{exist in}} the sap of Asian lacquer tree, are highly {{branched}} acidic polysaccharides with 1, 3 -β-galactan backbone and glucouronic acid terminals. Lacquer polysaccharides were reported to be antitumor active and blood coagulation promoting effective, which specific activities might be caused from electrostatic attraction between negative-charged carboxyl groups from the uronic acid terminal of polysaccharides, and positive-charged amino groups from target proteins. By use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the interaction dynamics between the polysaccharides and proteins can be quantitatively evaluated. Lacquer polysaccharides are usually found with two molecular weight fractions, 10 x 104 and 3. 0 x 104 Dalton {{in the proportion of}} about 25 % and 75 % respectively. In the previous study, the single fraction of 10 x 104 was reported to be degraded into 3. 0 x 104 after the sap was collected. The two pure fractions were first isolated in this study by using Sephadex size exclusive chromatography. It was found that both of the two fractions show the same structure by 1 H and 13 C NMR characterization. It was also found that addition of ferric or ferrous ion can lead to a gelation of lacquer polysaccharides with lower molecular weights in aqueous solution, suggesting that the degradation may cause by breakage of metal-carboxyl association linkages. Appearance at 1612 cm- 1 due to COO- ion of the IR spectra and alkaline degradation of 3. 0 x 104 fraction into 1. 4 x 104, which halved the molecular weight, could also be a proof of existence of metal-carboxyl association. In the dynamic study of proteins-polysaccharides interaction by SPR, poly-L-lysine as an all-positive charged polypeptide model was used to be evaluated the activity of lacquer polysaccharides and their derivatives. It was found that the interaction increased with increasing molecular weight of lacquer polysaccharides. In addition, the sulfated derivatives showed significantly high interactions with dissociation-rate constant of kd = 1. 74 x 10 - 4 [1 /s], association-rate constant of ka = 4. 31 x 104 [1 /Ms] and dissociation constant of KD= 4. 0 x 104 - 9 [M] respectively, while <b>original</b> <b>lacquer</b> polysaccharides gave only kd = 3. 54 x 10 - 4 [1 /s], ka = 4. 99 x 102 [1 /Ms] and KD = 7. 10 x 10 - 7 [M]. These result suggest that the sulfate groups, compared to carboxyl groups give stronger attraction to amino groups, and the interaction should be the reason why sulfated lacquer polysaccharides had potent anti-HIV acctivity. To evaluate the affection of sulfation to anti-HIV activities, lacquer polysaccharides were sulfated 1, 2 and 3 times respectively, by piperidine-N-sulfate to gives sulfated lacquer polysaccharides with different degree of sulfations. According to the amino acid sequence of V 3 loop, C-terminus, and CD 4 -binding domain of HIV surface glycoprotein gp 120 were synthesised and immobilized to the sensor chip separately. The C-terminus gave the highest response that increased with increasing the degree of sulfation. While the association-rate constant was different from the molecular weights, degree of sulfation, and binding ligands, the dissociation-rate constant of lacquer polysaccharide derivatives was not affective so much and gave rather low values. This implies high stability of the interaction and sulfated polysaccharides were expected for long-term effectives and were possible candidates as an anti-HIV medicine in the future...|$|R
