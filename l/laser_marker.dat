40|$|Authors: Massmiliano Cavallini, Denis Gentili, Pierpaolo Greco, Francesco Valle & Fabio Biscarini ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{provides the}} instructions for designing and fabricating stamping tools with features ranging from nanometer to micrometer scale, including the fabrication using commercial tools such as compact disks or digital video disks. In particular the reported procedures are oriented towards the tools fabrication for lithographically controlled wetting and soft lithography. Because the versatility of these methods that has almost no restrictions concerning the materials used for the stamps, {{a wide range of}} methods are provided in this protocol including photolithography, electron beam lithography, replica molding, laser engraving and nanoimprinting. ### Introduction **GENERAL INFORMATION** **PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY** Presently the most common method to fabricate rigid stamps (usually in silicon) and masters required for replica molding of the soft stamps is photolithography (see the protocol in ref. (1)). This process, widely used for microfabrication, is based on the selective removing of parts of a film upon the exposition to light (usually UV). This is achieved thanks to some materials known as photoresists, that are light-sensitive, meaning that, according to their composition, they become soluble or insoluble to their developing solution upon illumination. The first family is called positive photoresist and the second negative. The light is sent through a photomask that shadows the parts of the film that, according to the kind of resist used, must be removed or preserved. Different kind of masks can be used but their common feature is the ability to shadow as much as possible some parts of the photoresist below (contrasting power), the most used are transparent foils with pattern drawn by an ink non-transparent to UV-light or highly reflecting foils (usually metallic) where some portion have been removed by laser engraving. The current limits of photolithography is approximately 250 nm and the minimum feature size is 100 nm (2). These values are important on the one hand to define the ranges of fabrication of soft stamps for LCW {{but on the other hand}} for the forthcoming comparison with the feature sizes and resolution that LCW can achieve. The masks are usually drawn using CAD software and then transferred either by common printers on transparent foils, where the marks will represent the shadowed areas, or by laser engraving of highly reflective metallic sheets where the removed part will corresponding to the illuminated path. The photoresist film, upon illumination is then developed in the appropriate solution leaving on the surface only the features that will be used as master for replica molding or directly as stamp. **ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY** When the resolution limits required by the process are below those of photolithography (diffraction limit), electron beam lithography (EBL) is usually chosen for fabricating the masters. This technique is in fact able to achieve resolution of 20 - 30 nm in lateral size (see the protocol in ref. (1)), because it make use of an electron beam to locally alter the chemical properties of a material (resist) that will be then removed in a development step. Beside the illustrated resolution advantage one must remind that EBL is an expensive technology and it is a serial technique, thus it is much slower than photolithography. **REPLICA MOLDING** Replica molding (RM) is the most common way of fabricating the elastomeric stamp for soft lithography and LCW and it is one of the most important tools for these techniques. RM is based on the reticulation of the elastomeric precursors onto the master that is then removed, upon curing, by peeling it off. It is worth mentioning that the LCW is not limited to the elastomeric materials as other soft-lithographic methods and it makes wide use of rigid and metallic materials as it is shown other sections of this protocol. Nevertheless replica molding of the elastomeric materials still plays a crucial role because, making use of well known materials such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it allows tuning the surface properties of the stamp by liquid or plasma chemical treatments. Elastomeric stamps made of PDMS are deformed easily under the effect of capillary adhesion. The attractive force, exerted by the solution trapped between the substrate and the stamp, may involve sagging of the PDMS stamp and poor patterning in the region where the PDMS displaced the solution. The capillary force may be estimated according to De Gennes,(3) and needs to be considered during the design of the spacer and the dimensioning of the full PDMS replica. In this case, an effective parameter is the aspect ratio AR, defined as the ratio of width over thickness of the window delimited by the spacer. If we put PDMS Young modulus E ≈ 460 kPa, contact angle of solution θ = π/ 6, and surface tension γ = 0. 02 N/m (organic solvents), we derived the critical value for AR that will induce sagging for various distances between the substrate and the PDMS replica, by finite element calculation (Figure 1). The empirical relationship can be summarized with a linear abacus for fast design, providing that the overall dimension of the stamp is exceeding the window defined by the spacer. **NANOIMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY** Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is another important technique useful to fabricate tools (i. e. master for RM and stamps) for LCW. NIL consists of a physical (morphological) deformation of a thermoplastic material in a temperature and pressure controlled printing process. A silicon stamp fabricated by a conventional lithography such as EBL or photolithography is usually employed. In NIL the thermoplastic material (usually a polymer) is deformed by pressing the stamp into the polymer at a temperature above the polymer’s glass-transition temperature. The polymer is then cooled down below the glass-transition temperature and the stamp is removed. **VACUUM SUBLIMATION OF METALS** One of the advantages of LCW is the versatility with respect to the material of the stamp used for patterning. In this frame, a role is played also by metallic stamps, some of them (gold for instance) can be functionalized using thiol based Self Assembled Monolayers (SAM) to tune their surface properties. These stamps are usually fabricated by vacuum sublimation of a thin metallic layer on a master previously realized by one of the above mentioned techniques. For some substrates such as silicon or mica an adhesive layer (usually made of chromium or titanium) has to be previously evaporated on the underlying material to favour the stability of the metallic film. **COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE MASTER/STAMPS** Commercial metallic grids commonly used for Electron Microscopy experiments have proven to be very suitable for as a stamp for LCW (See Fig 2). When the grid comes as a large sheet that must be cut, it is crucial to cut it with very sharp scissors to avoid large deformations of the areas near the cut. For the most kind of patterning inexpensive masters such as Compact Disc (CD) Digital versatile disk (DVD) or diffraction gratings are commercially available. This kind of devices are made of: Blank CD, parallel stripes 1. 5 µm pitch, 500 nm width and 220 nm depth. Blank DVD, parallel stripes with 750 µm pitch, 300 nm width and 110 nm depth. Written disks contain a pattern o doth and line with the same size containing an information in digital (binary) code. Figure 3 shows typical AFM images CD and DVD masters. ### Reagents 1.

40|$|Prior to the Space Shuttle Program, space-borne {{vehicles}} {{launched into}} space were expended; consequently their part identifiers were applied using marking processes {{designed for use}} in ground operations. With the advent of reusable space transportation vehicles and retrievable satellites, NASA needed to rethink how part identification markings are applied to their space borne vehicles. Markings applied to reusable spacecraft need to survive the extreme environments encountered in space. To support this new requirement, NASA approached RVSI (now Siemens) to assist with a marking program to certify marking(s) for use in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). An experiment was designed to identify part identification methods and techniques that might survive the rigors of space. The experiment was to be designed to expose both human and machine-readable markings to LEO environments. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, vacuum, solar UV radiation, micrometeoroids and space debris, atomic oxygen (AO) and deep thermal cycles. Two specimen packages were assembled. The first package was incorporated into MISSE 1 and 2 (one year orbital experiments) and consisted of currently approved marking processes and number of newly developed Laser Additive marking techniques deemed safe for use in safety critical applications. The second package contained a series of more robust intrusive marking technique that utilized higher-powered <b>laser</b> <b>markers.</b> These specimens were incorporated in MISSE 3 and 4, which was scheduled to fly in orbit for three years. This report describes the results of the MISSE 1 and 2 marking experiments...|$|R

The Marines abandoned all their equipment, and although no one told us, {{it became clear that}} we were to withdraw. With no information, and the likelihood of having to fight our way out, Dave Greedus and I decided to abandon our equipment, destroying as much as we could.

40|$|Grave markers {{are often}} the only {{physical}} evidence of a person’s existence and offer opportunities for even ordinary people to ‘speak’ from the grave. Sometimes the deceased selects the marker or leaves instructions for its composition. In modern times, the grieving family typically chooses the type, style, motif, and inscription according to commercial availability, aesthetic appeal, and budgetary constraints. A cemetery visitor will likely {{have no idea of}} the actual circumstances that caused a particular marker to have its shape, design, and decorative elements. Like other possessions, markers are subject to fashion trends and since the advent of mass production and <b>laser</b> techniques, <b>markers</b> once unique for their individual carving may now be distinctive because modern technology permits extensive customization. This booklet seeks to provide the reader with an overview of the most frequently encountered marker types (shapes), styles, and motifs in Deep East Texas. Photographs are entirely from East Texas cemeteries, and thus may omit markers common in other areas...|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{tabletop}} {{and wall}} surfaces support collaboration and interactivity in novel ways. Apart {{from the traditional}} keyboards and mice, such systems can also incorporate other input devices, namely <b>laser</b> pointers, <b>marker</b> pens with screen location sensors, or touch-sensitive surfaces. Similarly, instead of a vertically positioned desktop monitor, collaborative setups typically use much larger displays, which are oriented either vertically (wall) or horizontally (tabletop), or combine both kinds of surfaces. In this paper we describe an empirical study that investigates how system constraints can affect group performance in high pace collaborative tasks. For this, we compare various input and output alternatives {{in a system that}} consists of interactive tabletop and wall surface(s). We observed that the performance of a group of people scaled almost linearly with the number of participants on an (almost perfectly) parallel task. We also found that mice were significantly faster than laser pointers, but only by 21 %. Also, interaction on walls was significantly faster than on the tabletop, by 51 %.

40|$|In {{radiation}} therapy, {{prior to}} each treatment fraction, the patient must {{be aligned to}} computed tomography (CT) data. Patient setup verification systems based on range imaging (RI) can accurately verify the patient position and adjust the treatment table at a fine scale, but require an initial manual setup using <b>lasers</b> and skin <b>markers.</b> We propose a novel markerless solution that enables a fully-automatic initial coarse patient setup. The table transformation that brings template and reference data in congruence is esti-mated from point correspondences based on matching local surface descriptors. Inherently, this point-based registra-tion approach is capable of coping with gross initial mis-alignments and partial matching. Facing the challenge of multi-modal surface registration (RI/CT), we have adapted state-of-the-art descriptors to achieve invariance to mesh resolution and robustness to variations in topology. In a case study on real data from a low-cost RI device (Mi-crosoft Kinect), the performance of different descriptors is evaluated on anthropomorphic phantoms. Furthermore, we have investigated the system’s resilience to deformations for mono-modal RI/RI registration of data from healthy volun-teers. Under gross initial misalignments, our method re-sulted in an average angular error of 1. 5 ◦ and an aver-age translational error of 13. 4 mm in RI/CT registration. This coarse patient setup provides a feasible initialization for subsequent refinement with verification systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{accuracy and}} time {{requirements of a}} stereoscopic X-ray-based positioning system in patients receiving conformal radiotherapy to the prostate. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Setup errors of the isocenter {{with regard to the}} bony pelvis were measured by means of orthogonal verification films and compared to conventional positioning (using skin drawings and <b>lasers)</b> and infrared <b>marker</b> (IR) based positioning in each of 261 treatments. In each direction, the random error represents the standard deviation and the systematic error the absolute value of the mean position. Time measurements were done in 75 treatments. RESULTS: Random errors with the X-ray positioning system in the anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and longitudinal direction were (average +/- 1 standard deviation) 2 +/- 0. 6 mm, 1. 7 +/- 0. 6 mm, and 2. 4 +/- 0. 7 mm. The corresponding values of conventional as well as IR positioning were significantly higher (p or= 5 mm occurred in 2 %- 14 % of treatments after X-ray positioning, 13 %- 29 % using IR markers, and 28 %- 53 % with conventional positioning. Total linac time for one treatment session was 14 min 51 s +/- 4 min 18 s, half of which was used for the X-ray-assisted positioning procedure. CONCLUSION: X-ray-assisted patient positioning significantly improves setup accuracy, at the cost of an increased treatment time. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
