25|$|In Standard Indian English, as in Australian, Singaporean, and British English, metric units {{such as the}} litre (liter), metre (meter), and {{metric tonne}} (ton) utilise the {{traditional}} spellings brought over from French, which differ from those used in the United States and the Philippines. The imperial <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> is invariably spelt with one 'n'. (See English in the Commonwealth of Nations for more information).|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per <b>long</b> <b>ton.</b> In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E
500|$|The South Georgia boat {{party could}} expect to meet hurricane-force winds and waves—the notorious Cape Horn Rollers—measuring from trough to crest as much as [...] Shackleton {{therefore}} selected the heaviest and strongest of the three boats, the [...] long James Caird. It had been built as a whaleboat in London to Worsley's orders, designed on the [...] "double-ended" [...] principle pioneered by Norwegian shipbuilder Colin Archer. Shackleton asked the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish, if he could make the vessel more seaworthy. Using improvised tools and materials, McNish raised the boat's sides and built a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing his work with oil paints, lamp wick, and seal blood. The craft was strengthened by having the mast of the Dudley Docker lashed inside, {{along the length of}} her keel. She was then fitted as a ketch, with a mainmast and a mizzenmast, rigged to carry lug sails and a jib. The weight of the boat was increased by the addition of approximately 1 <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> (1,016kg) of ballast, to lessen the risk of capsizing in the high seas that Shackleton knew they would encounter.|$|E

500|$|On 11 March 1943, the Cabinet of the United Kingdom {{formed the}} Brabazon Committee to {{determine}} the UK's airliner needs after {{the conclusion of the}} Second World War. One of its recommendations was for a pressurised, transatlantic mailplane that could carry non-stop, one <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> (1.0 t) of payload at a cruising speed of 400mph (640km/h). De Havilland chose to challenge the widely held scepticism of jet engines as too fuel-hungry and unreliable, So committee member Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, head of the de Havilland company, used his personal influence and his company's expertise to champion the development of a jet propelled aircraft; and proposed a specification for a pure turbojet-powered design. The committee accepted the proposal, calling it the [...] "Type IV" [...] (of five designs), and awarded a development and production contract to de Havilland under the designation Type 106 in February 1945. The type and design were to be so advanced that De Havilland had to undertake the design and development of both the airframe and the engines. This was because in 1945 no turbojet engine manufacturer in the world was drawing up a design specification for an engine with the thrust and specific fuel consumption, that could power an aircraft at the proposed cruising altitude (40 thousand feet), speed, and transatlantic range as was called for by the Type 106. First-phase development of the DH 106 focused on short and intermediate range mailplanes with a small passenger compartment and as few as six seats, before being redefined as a long-range airliner with a capacity of 24 seats. Out of all the Brabazon designs, the DH 106 was seen as the riskiest both in terms of introducing untried design elements and for the financial commitment involved. Nevertheless, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) found the Type IV's specifications attractive, and initially proposed a purchase of 25 aircraft; in December 1945, when a firm contract was laid out, the order total was revised to 10.|$|E
2500|$|... tonne or ton: In the UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, the {{spelling}} tonne {{refers to the}} metric unit (1000kilograms), which is the nomenclature used in SI units, whereas in the US the same unit is called a metric ton. The unqualified ton usually refers to the <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> (...) in the UK and to the short ton (...) in the US (but note that the tonne and <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> differ by only 1.6%, and are roughly interchangeable when accuracy is not critical; ton and tonne are usually pronounced the same in speech).|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 Niarchos had the 106,000 <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> [...] built. This was {{the largest}} {{merchant}} vessel ever built in the United States.

5|$|The {{amount of}} freight {{carried by the}} canal peaked in 1958 at 18 million <b>long</b> <b>tons</b> (20 million short tons), but the {{increasing}} size of ocean-going ships and the port's failure to introduce modern freight-handling methods resulted in that headline figure dropping steadily, and {{the closure of the}} docks in Salford in 1984.

50|$|A <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> {{is defined}} as exactly 2,240 pounds. The <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> arises from the {{traditional}} British measurement system: A <b>long</b> <b>ton</b> is 20 cwt, {{each of which is}} 8 stone (1 stone = 14 pounds).

5000|$|USS Harlan County, {{one of the}} Newport {{class of}} LSTs, was {{designed}} as a modernized [...] "battle-group" [...] version of the Tank Landing Ships (LSTs) of World War II.

5000|$|Other major {{proposals}} {{included the}} ones from Blohm & Voss and Vickers.

It would have been powered by six double-ended coal boilers with oil burners alongside. These boilers would have generated 38,000 shaft horsepower (shp) to drive four propellers, giving the ships a maximum speed of [...] Only one rudder would have been fitted.
