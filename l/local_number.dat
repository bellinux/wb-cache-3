5|$|A {{number of}} visiting black stars {{became part of}} the British R scene. These {{included}} Geno Washington, an American singer stationed in England with the Air Force. He was invited to join what became Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band by guitarist Pete Gage in 1965 and enjoyed top 40 hit singles and two top 10 albums before the band split up in 1969. Another American GI, Herbie Goins, sang with Blues Incorporated before leading his own band, the Nightimers. Jimmy James, born in Jamaica, moved to London after two <b>local</b> <b>number</b> one hits with The Vagabonds in 1960 and built a strong reputation as a live act, releasing a live album and their debut The New Religion in 1966 and achieving moderate success with singles before the original Vagabonds broke up in 1970. Champion Jack Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie pianist, who toured Europe and settled there from 1960, living in Switzerland and Denmark, then in Halifax, England in the 1970s and 1980s, before finally settling in Germany.|$|E

To mark {{the difference between}} the Printers and Mailers Unions, the ITU used the M before the <b>local</b> <b>number.</b> In New York City, Typographical #6 and Mailers, M-6. The position of the mailers was that of second class citizens in the ITU, with no voice on the executive council. Mailers Cary Weaver and Munro Roberts felt the needs of mailers fell on deaf printer ears on the ITU executive council.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{distance}} dialing, {{which allowed}} callers to reach other users outside their local calling area without operator assistance, {{was introduced to}} the public in Englewood. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California. As of that date, customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial some exchanges in the New York City area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code preceding the <b>local</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 029 is {{the current}} {{telephone}} dialling code for Cardiff, {{as well as for}} the neighbouring towns of Penarth, Dinas Powys and Caerphilly. The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area, with it being possible to dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit <b>local</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Local</b> <b>number</b> {{portability}} (LNP) {{allows a}} subscriber to request moving an existing telephone number to another telephone service provider. Number portability usually has geographic limitations, {{such as an}} existing local phone company only being able to port to a competitor within the same rate centre. [...] Mobile carriers may have much larger market areas, and can assign or accept numbers from any area within the region.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Area codes in County Donegal were combined {{into a single}} area code (074) with 7-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbering.</b> While other parts of South Donegal were combined into the (071) area code (e.g. Bundoran, Rossnowlagh) The area codes abolished were 073, 075 and 077. All <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> became 7-digit.|$|R
30|$|The <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number,</b> <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number,</b> and the <b>local</b> {{nanoparticle}} density are nonlinear increasing {{functions of}} the momentum slip parameter for the first solution while they are a decreasing function for {{the case of the}} second solution. It {{is interesting to note that}} the generation of vorticity for the shrinking velocity is reduced by an increase in the momentum slip at the surface (when α_ 1 > 1). The momentum slip parameter enhances the velocity at the surface which forces the solute and particle to move away from the surface. As a result, the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number,</b> <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number,</b> and <b>local</b> nanoparticle Sherwood <b>number</b> increase nonlinearly with the momentum slip parameter but decrease with increases in the solute slip coefficient. It evident that the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number</b> decreases with increase of the partial thermal slip coefficient and this finding is similar to earlier results by Zheng et al. [31]. The nature of the second solution for the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number,</b> <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number,</b> and <b>local</b> nanoparticle Sherwood <b>number</b> is quite similar and this mainly depends on the momentum slip coefficient rather than the other slip coefficient.|$|R
2500|$|Telephonic {{communication}} between the two cities requires international calling. To call Tijuana from the United States, [...] "011" [...] (the US international call prefix) must be dialed followed by Mexico's country calling code [...] "52"; to call San Diego from Mexico, [...] "00" [...] (the ITU prefix) must be dialed followed by [...] "1" [...] (the North American Numbering Plan calling code). Then the caller will in both cases proceed to dial the area code and the <b>local</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{in all of}} British Columbia, {{incumbent}} telephone {{services is}} provided by Telus; the area codes serving Tsawwassen are 604 and 778 - though the latter is primarily used for cell phones. The original CO Code servicing Tsawwassen was 943, but as the population expanded, a new code, 948, {{was introduced in the}} early 1990s. New codes have since been added, and <b>local</b> <b>number</b> portability has blurred traditional exchange differences. [...] Phone calls within Tsawwassen or the entire 604/778 region must adhere to the process of 10-digit dialing.|$|E
2500|$|Subscribers {{may choose}} a {{number in the}} country of the service they {{subscribe}} to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional [...] "virtual numbers" [...] for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's <b>local</b> <b>number</b> portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).|$|E
50|$|Population {{growth over}} the next few decades meant there was a need for more lines. This would see an {{exchange}} with existing three-digit numbers open one or more new ranges with four-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> (e.g. 5000-6999), and exchanges with existing four-digit numbers open one or more new ranges with five-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> (e.g. 60000-69999).|$|R
50|$|Post 2000, {{only a dozen}} {{places have}} long STD codes with five-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbers.</b> One area with a long STD code retains four-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbering.</b> Long STD codes are rare. Many people are not {{familiar}} with the (0xx xx), nowadays (01xx xx) format; or the now discontinued (0xx xxx) format, and often omit the space in written form.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This work {{uses the}} {{integral}} method {{to study the}} heat and mass transfer by mixed convection from vertical plates with constant wall temperature and concentration in porous media saturated with an electrically conducting fluid {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field. The approximate integral solutions are found to be in reasonable agreement with the similarity solutions. Results are plotted for the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number,</b> the <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number,</b> and the ratio of the thermal boundary layer thickness to the concentration boundary layer thickness. Increasing the buoyancy parameter tends to increase the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number</b> and the <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number,</b> while increasing the magnetic parameter decreases the <b>local</b> Nusselt <b>number</b> and the <b>local</b> Sherwood <b>number...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first was}} an update {{to a small}} number of {{geographic}} dialling codes in response to the rapid late-1990s growth of telecommunications and impending exhaustion of <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> in several cities. The change greatly expanded the pool of available numbers within those places while retaining 'local dialling' (the ability to dial <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> directly, without needing to dial an area code first). The change affected the dialling codes assigned to Cardiff, Coventry, London, Northern Ireland, Portsmouth and Southampton, culminating in a large switch on 22 April 2000. All of these places moved to eight-digit <b>local</b> <b>numbers</b> ensuring sufficient <b>local</b> capacity for many decades (London saw a five-fold increase in capacity, for example). No other geographic area codes were affected.|$|R
