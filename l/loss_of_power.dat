5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was also}} reported in Sinaloa on the Mexican mainland. The remnants of Ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior California. Over 300 lightning strikes from the remnant moisture {{was recorded in}} a one-hour period.

40|$|A design {{requirement}} probability of 0. 01 {{or less in}} a 4 -hour period ensures that the nuclear heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in the primary confinement areas of the Dry Transfer Facilities (DTFs) and Fuel Handling Facility (FHF) is working during a Category 1 drop event involving commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) assemblies (BSC 2004 a, Section 5. 1. 1. 48). This corresponds to an hourly HVAC failure rate of 2. 5 E- 3 per hour or less, which is contributed to by two dominant causes: equipment failure and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>power.</b> Meeting this minimum threshold ensures that a Category 1 initiating event followed {{by the failure of}} HVAC is a Category 2 event sequence. The two causes for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>power</b> include the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> offsite <b>power</b> and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> onsite <b>power</b> distribution. Thus, {{in order to meet the}} threshold requirement aforementioned, the failure rate <b>of</b> mechanical equipment, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> offsite <b>power,</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> onsite <b>power</b> distribution must be less than or equal to 2. 5 E- 3 per hour for the nuclear HVAC system in the primary confinement areas of the DTFs and FHF. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> offsite <b>power</b> occurs at a frequency of 1. 1 E- 5 per hour (BSC 2004 a, Section 5. 1. 1. 48). The purpose of this analysis is to determine the probability of occurrence of the unavailability of the nuclear HVAC system in the primary confinement areas of the DTFs and FHF due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>power.</b> In addition, this analysis provides insights on the contribution to the unavailability of the HVAC system due to equipment failure. The scope of this analysis is limited to finding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>power</b> to the nuclear HVAC system in the primary confinement areas of the DTFs and FHF...|$|R

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in the left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck {{the roof of the}} apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the process}} of cooling system design, the {{traditional}} method is calculating <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> devices, building thermal model <b>of</b> <b>power</b> devices, establishing system structure model, and making thermal analysis. While, the ideal assumptions and complex equivalent models in traditional methods bring in large error and the analysis of whole system model reduces the effectiveness of cooling system design for complicated high-power inverters. In this paper, the <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> devices in NPC (Neutral-Point-Clamped) three-level inverter based on SVPWM(Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation) was calculated firstly; the input power and cooling <b>power</b> <b>of</b> each <b>power</b> module block were analyzed, and the cooling <b>power</b> <b>of</b> each block supplied by cooling fan was obtained {{to figure out the}} cooling fan parameters. The designed forced-air cooling system was proved by finite element simulation. Finally, the temperature rise experiment was carried out on a 1 MW NPC three-level inverter, and the results proved the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R
5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> at the park marina.|$|E
5|$|In New Hampshire, the {{hurricane}} produced winds gusts {{of up to}} 38mph (61km/h) and around 1inch (25mm) of rain along the coast. In Maine, heavy surf closed several beaches and injured two people. Waves also damaged several boats. Winds were moderate near the coast, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with gusts to 54mph (87km/h) at Mount Desert Island. The winds knocked over several trees and caused sporadic power outages throughout the state, including <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for 1,900 Portland residents. In Kittery, water fell through an office building, damaging computer equipment. Rainfall was minor, peaking at 1.23inches (31.24mm) in Eastport.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{production}} was slowed {{as a result}} of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Oil prices rose above $80 a barrel in intraday trading on September 12 as a result, ending the next day at a record high of $80.09 a barrel. Natural gas futures rose 8percent ahead of the storm, but lost most of those gains the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E

5|$|As Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton {{stopped in}} the pit lane with a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and was pushed back into the garage. He was {{eventually}} {{able to go on}} track and qualified third, after starting several quick laps only to abandon them to leave his final run to the last moment. He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost three-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten. Ricciardo's pole position was the first for a Renault-powered turbocharged car since Ayrton Senna's front-of-the-grid start at the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} impact on the Ruhr armaments production was the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> hydroelectric <b>power.</b> Two power stations (producing 5,100 kilowatts) associated with the dam were destroyed and seven others were damaged. This resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>power</b> in the factories and many households in the region for two weeks. In May 1943 coal production dropped by 400,000 tons which German sources attribute {{to the effects of}} the raid.|$|R
50|$|The {{crossover}} {{was followed}} by a one-shot called House of M: Decimation - The Day After, a series called Son of M that depicts Quicksilver dealing with his <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> and Generation M, which devoted each issue to a different mutant dealing with the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their <b>powers.</b> Characters who appeared include Chamber, Jubilee, and Blob. Characters who lost their powers included Dani Moonstar, Magneto, and Tag. The storyline also led to the reboot of Excalibur into New Excalibur, a shift in the creative teams of several comics, and the debut of several spin-off series, including X-Men: Deadly Genesis, X-Men: The 198, Sentinel Squad O*N*E, Ms. Marvel, and a new X-Factor series.|$|R

5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the Whigs {{split from}} the Democratic-Republicans in {{response}} to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, {{the remnants of the}} old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and swept into power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion to modernize the state's infrastructure. The wilderness of northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, and half of their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig's <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
