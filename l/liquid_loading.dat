The <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> point corresponds to the overall packed bed <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> above which there is an increment in the liquid flowing outside the catalytic baskets and the catalytic baskets themselves are saturated with liquid. From tomographic images, we show that several factors affect the wetting and filling of catalytic baskets. The complex hybrid structure of catalytic packings influences the liquid distribution inside the elements. The liquid preferentially fills the external catalytic baskets because they receive the liquid not only from the packing element situated above but also from the wall wipers. Moreover, liquid hold-up inside a catalytic basket section depends significantly on the vertical position in the packing element and on the position of the packing in the column packed bed.

In this work, a three dimensional CFD model at small scale for hydrodynamics and physical mass transfer in structured packing elements is developed.

40|$|Due to the {{influence}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>load,</b> the equivalent resistance of in-liquid quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) increases sharply, and the quality factor and resonant frequency decreases. We found that the change in the resonant frequency of in-liquid QCM consisted of two parts: besides the frequency changes due to the mass and viscous load (which could be equivalent to motional inductance), the second part of frequency change was caused by the increase of motional resistance. The theoretical calculation and simulation proved that the increases of QCM motional resistance may indeed cause the decreases of resonant frequency, and revealed that the existence of static capacitance was the root cause of this frequency change. The second part of frequency change (due to the increases of motional resistance) was difficult to measure accurately, and may cause great error for in-liquid QCM applications.

40|$|Electroporation is {{the process}} where {{externally}} applied electric fields cause significantly increased permeability of the cell membrane. The increased permeability allows the transport of external compounds into the cell. This is important for applications in electrochemotheropy, electrofusion and drug delivery. Electroporation also has applications in the disinfection of liquids. Given a high enough electric field across the cell membrane, the electroporation process can become irreversible, leading to cell destruction. With the cell membrane under an intense electric field, the cell membrane structure fails causing the cell to die. Conventional liquid beverage disinfection systems rely on slow heating methods requiring large power requirements; this can reduce the taste and quality of some liquids. Pulse generators provide the necessary electric fields to produce the required voltage potential across the cell membrane. The usefulness of electroporation depends on several parameters such as amplitude, frequency and rise/fall times of the electric field. The wave shape also has a bearing on performance, and {{is limited by the}} pulse generator topology. A multilevel bipolar waveform is desired with operating frequencies above about 1 kHz. The cascaded H-bridge or full-bridge topology is the most useful as it capable of producing multilevel bipolar waveforms at high frequency. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a multilevel high-voltage pulse generator, capable of creating very high-voltage AC pulses. MOSFET switching devices in conjunction with good layout practices were used to provide required fast switching speeds. The full-bridge topology is used to create a multilevel output profile through cascading of multiple stages. As a full-bridge topology inherently creates a RCL resonant network, there are many challenges associated with mitigating high-frequency noise sources. Two separate stages are built, a low voltage stage capable of outputting up to 200 Vp and a high voltage stage capable of switching up to 1 kVp. A control board was also built for pulse signal generation and user configuration of the output waveforms. The designed pulse generator can produce short pulses of up to 1. 4 kVp at frequencies of up to 350 kHz using primarily resistive loads (that simulate a conductive <b>liquid</b> <b>load).</b> Little high frequency switching noise was observable on the output waveform.

In three-phase separators, well fluid is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately.
