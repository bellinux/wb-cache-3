40|$|The {{prediction}} of future mortality rates by any existing mortality projection models is hardly tobe exact, which causes an exposure to mortality and <b>longevity</b> <b>risks</b> for life insurance companies. Since {{a change in}} mortality rates has opposite impacts on the surpluses of life insurance andannuity products, hedging strategies of mortality and <b>longevity</b> <b>risks</b> can be implemented bycreating an insurance portfolio of both life insurance and annuity products. In this project, wedevelop a framework of implementing non-size free matching strategies to hedge against mortalityand <b>longevity</b> <b>risks.</b> We apply relational models to capture the mortality movements byassuming that the simulated mortality sequence is a proportional and/or a constant change ofthe expected one, {{and the amount of}} the changes varies in the length of the sequence. Withthe magnitude of the proportional and/or constant changes, we determine the optimal weightsof allocating the life insurance and annuity products in a portfolio for mortality immunizationaccording to each of the proposed matching strategies. Comparing the hedging performanceof non-size free matching strategies with size free ones proposed by Lin and Tsai (2014), wedemonstrate that non-size free matching strategies can hedge against mortality and longevityrisks more effectively than the corresponding size free ones...|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes an {{additive}} continuous-time stochastic mortality model which revises that (B&H model) of Ballotta and Haberman (2006). The {{structure of}} the B&H model implies that the future hazard rate {{is proportional to the}} stochastic component, thus inducing two questionable features. First, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will be enlarged as the base hazard rate increases. However, an increase in the base hazard rate may not cause a dramatic increase suggested by the exponential component of B&H (2006). Second, in the B&H model, the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will be larger in the group which is older and will be greatly augmented by the interaction of age and time. But the uncertainty of the future hazard rate may not increase with an increase in age. The problems can be resolved by our additive structure which is the sum of a deterministic estimator and a stochastic component. Since using the additive structure will contribute {{to the fact that the}} stochastic component is independent of age and the base hazard rate, in our model the uncertainty of the future hazard rate will not be affected by an increase in age or in the base hazard rate. We further demonstrate an application of our model by calculating reserves of <b>longevity</b> <b>risks</b> for pure endowments and various common annuity products in the UK. We also compare our results with those of the B&H model. Stochastic mortality <b>Longevity</b> <b>risks</b> Mortality risk Reserves Annuity...|$|R

50|$|Pension plans face {{a variety}} of {{liability}} risks including price and wage inflation risk, interest rate risk and <b>longevity</b> <b>risk.</b> While some of these risks materialize slowly over time, others - such as interest rate risk - are felt with each measurement period. Liabilities are the actuarial present value of future plan cash flows, discounted at current interest rates. Thus, asset/liability management strategies often include bonds and swaps or other derivatives to accomplish some degree of interest rate hedging (immunization, cash flow matching, duration matching, etc.). Such approaches are sometimes called “liability-driven investment” (LDI) strategies. In 2008, plans with such approaches strongly outperformed those with traditional “total return” seeking investment policies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of {{variable}} investment-linked deferred annuities (VILDAs) on lifecycle consumption, saving, and portfolio allocation patterns given stochastic and systematic mortality. Insurers have taken two approaches to manage systematic mortality risks, namely self-insurance and risk transfer to purchasers of the annuity products. We demonstrate that self-insurance leads to high loadings, so that households offered a choice would favor the risk transfer scheme. Reservation loadings on the actuarially fair VILDA price for non-participation are 0. 5 - 8 %; if insurers cannot hedge within this range, they will transfer systematic <b>longevity</b> <b>risks</b> to the annuitants. Our findings have implications for new payout products that may be attractive to older households seeking to protect against retirement shortfalls. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Longevity</b> <b>risk</b> is a {{major issue}} for the {{developed}} world. As both mortality rates and birth rates fall, the increasing burden of providing for retirees falls on a smaller working population. Under such circumstances, the accurate modelling and measurement of <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> becomes particularly important. <b>Longevity</b> <b>risk</b> {{is present in the}} annuity portfolios of insurance companies, and increasingly of reinsurers as well.

The <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> is accelerated correspondingly. In this paper, housing reverse mortgage <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> securitization is introduced, and empirical analysis is conducted with the survivor bonds as the case. According to the <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> bond model, a sensitivity test is carried out on the survivor bonds by acknowledging the impact of mortality improvement on the investment income. This is seen to be of assistance {{for the design of}} future housing reverse mortgage <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> bonds. The main body of this paper consists of six parts. The first chapter is the introduction, covering a brief research background, research problems, assumptions and limitations. The second chapter is the literature review. The development of the <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> market, management method, securitization products, <b>longevity</b> <b>risk,</b> pricing model of <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> derivatives and optimal allocation design have been reviewed. The third chapter is the methodology including both qualitative and quantitative methods used in this study. The <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> bond type, structure and cash flow analysis of the current housing reverse mortgage loan is introduced with emphasis. The fourth chapter is the overview of the background to study, with housing reverse mortgage, <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> securitization and the securitization of the housing reverse mortgage loan. Secondly, the meaning of <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> and mortality risk is illustrated broadly. The fifth chapter is the empirical analysis of the impact of housing reverse mortgage loan <b>longevity</b> <b>risk</b> bond on the investment income. Sensitivity analysis is conducted for the natural mortality and average housing price growth rate. The sixth chapter is the conclusion. It summarizes the main contribution, managerial conclusions, and puts forward some new prospects on future researches. To conclude, throughout the sensitivity test, it can be found that the Lee-carter model is more dynamic, and can be modified to more forms in mortality prospect researches. The results also show that, there is a limited impact on investor's returns along with the mortality improvement, which oversees that it fits Chinese market.

40|$|Prediction {{of future}} {{mortality}} rates {{is crucial to}} insurance companies because they face <b>longevity</b> <b>risks</b> while providing retirement benefits to a population whose life expectancy is increasing. In the past literature, a time series model based on multivariate power-normal distribution has been applied on mortality data from the United States for the years 1933 till 2000 to forecast the future mortality rates for the years 2001 till 2010. In this paper, a more dynamic approach based on the multivariate time series will be proposed where the model uses stochastic parameters that vary with time. The resulting prediction intervals obtained using the model with stochastic parameters perform better because apart from having good ability in covering the observed future mortality rates, {{they also tend to}} have distinctly shorter interval lengths...|$|R

The numerical results show that the presence of health spending risk drives households to shift their portfolios from risky equities to safer assets and works to enhance the demand for annuities due to their increasing-with-age superiority over bonds as a hedge against life-contingent health spending as well as <b>longevity</b> <b>risks.</b> The safe and higher-return annuities in turn provide a greater leverage for equity investment in the remaining asset portfolios.
