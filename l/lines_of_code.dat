5|$|Redemption {{was officially}} {{released}} to manufacturing on May 30, 2000. The game features 300,000 <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code,</b> with a further 66,000 lines for JAVA scripts. In January 2000, {{it was announced}} that Nihilistic was seeking a studio to port Redemption to the Sega Dreamcast video game console, however this version was never released. In February 2001, after the release of the PC version, {{it was announced that}} MacSoft was developing a MacOS version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E
5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages {{are similar to those}} of saving screen real estate with K&R style. An added advantage is that the starting and closing braces are consistent in application (both share space with a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code),</b> relative to K&R style, where one brace shares space with a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> and one brace has a line alone.|$|R

50|$|Each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> has an LCSAJ 'density' {{associated}} with it; line 17, for instance, appears within 6 unique LCSAJs - i.e. {{it has an}} LCSAJ density of 6. This is helpful when evaluating the maintainability of the code; If a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> is to be changed then the density is indicative of how many LCSAJs {{will be affected by}} that change.|$|R

25|$|Industrial {{application}} of CSP to software design has usually focused on dependable and safety-critical systems. For example, the Bremen Institute for Safe Systems and Daimler-Benz Aerospace modeled a {{fault management system}} and avionics interface (consisting of some 23,000 <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code)</b> intended for use on the International Space Station in CSP, and analyzed the model to confirm that their design was free of deadlock and livelock. The modeling and analysis process was able to uncover a number of errors {{that would have been}} difficult to detect using testing alone. Similarly, Praxis High Integrity Systems applied CSP modeling and analysis during the development of software (approximately 100,000 <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code)</b> for a secure smart-card Certification Authority to verify that their design was secure and free of deadlock. Praxis claims that the system has a much lower defect rate than comparable systems.|$|E
25|$|Interpreters {{are used}} to execute source code from a {{programming}} language line-by-line. The interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters {{is that they can}} easily be extended to an interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> are typed in and performed immediately.|$|E
25|$|Qubes {{implements}} a Security by Isolation approach. The {{assumption is}} {{that there can be}} no perfect, bug-free desktop environment. Such an environment counts millions of <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code,</b> billions of software/hardware interactions. One critical bug in any of these interactions may be enough for malicious software to take control over a machine.|$|E
25|$|APL is {{well known}} for its use of a set of non-ASCII symbols, which are an {{extension}} of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation. Having single character names for SIMD vector functions is one way that APL enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing Conway's Game of Life in one <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code.</b> In nearly all versions of APL, it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression, that is, in one <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{function}} point analysis sizing {{standard is}} supported by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). It can be applied early in the software development life-cycle and it is not dependent on <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> like the somewhat inaccurate Backfiring method. The method is technology agnostic and can be used for comparative analysis across organizations and across industries.|$|E

25|$|They {{also may}} claim {{that because it}} is compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger-scale {{software}} development and complexity, {{because the number of}} <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> can be dramatically reduced. Many APL advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as COBOL and Java as being comparatively tedious. APL is often found where time-to-market is important, such as with trading systems.|$|E

25|$|Since macros {{can have}} 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code,</b> {{they can be}} used to make {{assembly}} language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features.|$|E
25|$|As the {{computer}} kernel grows, so grows {{the size and}} vulnerability of its trusted computing base; and, besides reducing security, there {{is the problem of}} enlarging the memory footprint. This is mitigated to some degree by perfecting the virtual memory system, but not all computer architectures have virtual memory support. To reduce the kernel's footprint, extensive editing has to be performed to carefully remove unneeded code, which can be very difficult with non-obvious interdependencies between parts of a kernel with millions of <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to make the game online-only was {{based in part on}} the success of Age of Empires II and the popularity of its online integration with MSN Gaming Zone. Since online player interaction through the game was made a priority by the studio, two iterations of the game had to be created; a server version and a client version. This resulted in a heavily modified version of the BANG engine used in previous games of the series, along with requiring large amounts of additional server code and infrastructure to be implemented. Excluding the tools, Age of Empires Online contains over 1.2 million <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
