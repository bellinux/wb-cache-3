25|$|Lever-action guns {{represent}} the earliest successful repeating actions. Essentially unchanged {{for over a}} century, <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> rifles are faster to operate than a bolt action, though the traditional designs and tubular magazines used limit the pressures and bullet shapes that can be used. The use of <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> hunting rifles is deeply embedded in American culture.|$|E
25|$|A repeating rifle is {{a single}} barreled rifle {{containing}} multiple rounds of ammunition. Benjamin Tyler Henry, chief designer for Oliver Fisher Winchester's arms company, adapted a breech-loading rifle built by Walter Hunt and invented the first practical <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> repeating rifle in 1860. First known as the Henry rifle, it became famously known as the Winchester by Union soldiers in the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Cimarron {{produces}} firearms {{within the}} industry of western reproduction arms. The firearms are manufactured to their specifications by Uberti and Davide Pedersoli in Brescia, Italy. Uberti makes their revolvers, <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> rifles {{as well as the}} 1885 single shot falling block rifle, and shotguns. Pedersoli makes rolling block and falling block single shot rifles to their specifications. In 2011 Cimarron contracted Armscor to manufacture a pre-World War 2 pattern 1911 semiautomatic pistol to their specifications.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>lever</b> <b>actions</b> have a tubular {{magazine}} {{under the}} barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rim-fire primers rather than center-fire primers. The safety {{problem is that}} long-range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire center-fire cartridges. A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some <b>lever</b> <b>actions</b> such as the Savage Model 99 can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The Winchester Model 1895 also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for [...]30-06 and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.|$|R
25|$|Pump-action {{weapons are}} faster to cycle than <b>lever</b> <b>actions,</b> {{but are not}} well suited for firing from a {{supported}} position. Most pump-action designs are found in shotguns, which are typically fired from a standing position where {{the movement of the}} arm to operate the action is not an issue.|$|R
5000|$|Winchester's Model 9422 was {{introduced}} in 1972. It was designed to capture {{the image of the}} traditional lever-actions with exposed hammer, straight grip, tube magazine and barrel bands. Unlike older Winchester <b>lever</b> <b>actions</b> it came grooved for scope mounting. It was offered in [...]22 Long Rifle and [...]22 WMR, and was priced at {{the high end of the}} [...]22 LR sporting rifle market.|$|R
25|$|In August 2015 Leyonhjelm {{negotiated}} {{a deal to}} include a 12 month sunset clause on the temporary ban on importing the Adler <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> shotgun. The Government imposed the ban in July, while it reviewed the technical specifications of weapons {{in the wake of}} the Martin Place Siege. The Federal Government has agreed to allow the importation of the shotgun, in exchange for support on migration laws. A week prior to the ban lapsing as a result of the sunset clause, the Government reimposed the ban.|$|E
25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by <b>lever</b> <b>action,</b> releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E

50|$|Stronger <b>lever</b> <b>actions,</b> such as {{the action}} of the Marlin Model 1894 can utilize {{high-pressure}} cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary locking bolts ({{such as the}} Browning BLR with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the 300 Winchester mag, 300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum. Tilting block designs such as the Savage Model 99 are also strong enough to handle high pressures.|$|R

[...] Otto Schlicht patented an action in 1932 (...) which improved the pivot method of the <b>action</b> <b>levers</b> and allowed <b>action</b> <b>levers</b> to be manufactured by bending metal stock rather than by die stamping.

40|$|In {{a context}} of {{project-based}} organization reinforcement, the question of knowledge management has become an important issue for companies {{as well as for}} research in management. The point for the companies is to jointly manage the knowledge development and the development of innovative products and services through projects. The literature recognizes the need for a link between knowledge management and project-based organization, but contributions are nonetheless limited when it comes to distinguish the various <b>levers</b> of <b>action</b> that could be triggered to manage knowledge together with projects. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the different levers of this joint management. Our research is based on a qualitative approach, centered on a multiple case study, undertaken within four project-oriented companies operating in different sectors: IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Arkopharma, and Temex. The analysis of the four cases, in the light of the existing literature, enables us to identify and discuss eight <b>levers</b> of <b>action</b> ensuring the link between knowledge management and project-based organization: formalization of project management, post-project analysis, project documentation and its computer storage, professional communities of practice, physical proximity of the actors, staff inter-project meetings, occupational projects, and research and development upstream. The paper is original because it investigates the framework of <b>levers</b> of <b>action</b> to improve the understanding of knowledge management in project-based organizations...|$|R
40|$|ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4951 - 2106 - 7 International audienceThe {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this paper is to identify behavior and generic expectations of elderly people (mean= 65 years) relevant to Human-Machine Interface (HMI) in the context of health. Our work is based on two industrial cases of health care services. In one case, we conducted user tests on HMI coupled with an eye-tracker to identify one behavior pattern (16 subjects). And in both industrial cases, we realized interviews that reveal generic expectations in terms of information from seniors (16 + 8 subjects). Then, this double-case approach has enabled us to emphasize the explorer behavior of seniors and expectations “in the periphery of health” with a need for both social and reassuring projection. Based on our results, we propose recommendations for HMI design in our context and which <b>levers</b> (<b>action</b> parameters) for design in other fields...|$|R

2500|$|The Wagon Box Fight was an {{engagement}} on August 2, 1867, {{in the vicinity}} of Fort Phil Kearny, Wyoming, during Red Cloud's War. A party of 26 U.S. Army soldiers and 6 civilians were attacked by several hundred Lakota Sioux warriors. Although outnumbered, the soldiers were armed with newly supplied breech-loading Springfield Model 1866 rifles and <b>Lever</b> <b>Action</b> Henry rifles, and had a defensive wall of wagon boxes to protect them. They held off the attackers for hours with few casualties, although they lost a large number of horses and mules driven off by the raiders.|$|E
2500|$|Military rifle {{propellant}} was {{manufactured in}} batches in a procedure taking {{about two weeks}} from treating cotton linters with nitric acid, through curing the extruded grains to evaporate excess ether and alcohol, and finally coating the dried grains with DNT and graphite. Each batch had somewhat different reaction rates, so testing was required to determine the appropriate charge to generate required reaction pressure in the intended cartridge. Test results were forwarded to the factory or arsenal assembling cartridges. Propellants packaged in small sheet metal canisters for sale to civilians were labeled Military Rifle Powder to distinguish the product from low-density [...] "bulk" [...] propellants intended to react at lower pressures in shotguns or pistols and from Sporting Rifle Powder for early <b>lever</b> <b>action</b> rifles unable to withstand the pressures of 20th-century service rifle cartridges. Charges of low-density [...] "bulk" [...] propellants were often similar to the volumes of gunpowder used in older firearms and reaction rates were less variable at low pressures appropriate for those cartridges; but each batch of military rifle propellant required a different canister label specifying the batch or lot number with the tested charge weight to generate appropriate reaction pressure in intended cartridges.|$|E
50|$|The William A. Johnson Organ Company of Westfield, Massachusetts, {{which later}} became Johnson & Son Organ Company, {{was a highly}} {{respected}} firm that built 860 pipe organs throughout the United States and in Canada and Bermuda.

All Johnson organs were completely mechanical (tracker action) organs, with Barker <b>lever</b> tracker-pneumatic <b>actions</b> utilized in larger organs after 1871.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>lever</b> <b>actions</b> are not {{as strong}} as bolt-action or {{semi-automatic}} rifle actions. The weaker actions utilize low- and medium-pressure cartridges, somewhat similar to high-powered pistol ammunition. To increase the bullet's energy at the relatively low velocities, these often have larger, heavier bullets than other types of rifles. The most common cartridge is the [...]30-30, introduced by Winchester with the Model 1894. Other common cartridges include: [...]38 Special/.357 Magnum, [...]44 Special/.44 Magnum, [...]41 Magnum, [...]444 Marlin, [...]45-70, [...]45 Colt, [...]32-20 Winchester, [...]35 Remington, [...]308 Marlin Express, [...]22 calibre rimfire, and [...]300 Savage. There is dispute about which of these cartridges can safely be used to hunt large game or large predators. Even in the largest calibres, the low velocities give these cartridges much lower energies than Elephant gun cartridges with comparable calibres. However, even the smallest cartridges fit lightweight, handy rifles that can be excellent for hunting small herbivores, pest control and personal defense.|$|R
50|$|A 34-rank organ in the Swiss {{village of}} Ursy is {{equipped}} with hi-tech features from Syncordia, including what some erroneously claim is the first non-mechanical action that directly controls {{the opening of a}} pipe organ's pallets in direct proportion to key movement—ostensibly combining the virtues of electric action with the intimate control of tracker action.

5000|$|Wedged mauls: A typical wood {{splitting}} maul has a head weight of 6 to 8 lb or approximately 2.7 to 3.6 kg, respectively. Traditionally, mauls have a wedge-shaped head, but some modern versions have conical heads or swiveling sub-wedges. The original maul resembles an axe {{but with a}} broader head. For splitting wood, this tool {{is much better than}} a typical axe. The weight of it is more advantageous and due to its width, it is less likely to become stuck in the wood. The wedge section of a maul head must be slightly convex to avoid jamming and it cannot have the elongated [...] "hollow ground" [...] concave-section that a cutting axe may use. Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul's handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common.
