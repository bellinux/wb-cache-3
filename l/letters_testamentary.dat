50|$|When {{the will}} was offered for probate in Massachusetts, there was {{objection}} by the heirs upon the grounds, among others, {{of lack of}} testamentary capacity and undue influence. After a hearing, the probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues for trial before a jury. In that situation, a compromise agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees, and the executors under the will and the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement provided that the will should be admitted to probate and <b>letters</b> <b>testamentary</b> issued; that the specific and pecuniary bequests to individuals should be enforced; that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $200,000 should {{be paid to the}} heirs, and a like amount to the Endowment Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined, should be equally divided between the trustees of the Endowment Trust and the heirs.|$|E
50|$|Discontented {{with their}} {{inheritance}} prospects, the “heirs” seek {{to grab the}} whole of their wealthy relative’s fortune, enlisting {{the help of the}} notary’s clerk Goupil. The doctor conceals a <b>letter</b> of <b>testamentary</b> intention in a legal volume in his library. This, together with three bearer bonds, is stolen by one of the doctor’s nephews, the postmaster François Minoret-Levrault, who, in the era before railways, owns and manages the carriage and postchaise services in and out of Nemours.|$|R

But {{the name of that}} family, Davie boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws: an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of {{learning}} as befitted his position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the <b>testamentary</b> <b>letter</b> itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother." ...|$|R
60|$|Encouraged by this encomium, I proceeded, {{in answer}} to his inquiries, to relate what I remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of those {{circumstances}} which had brought about a neglect of my father's <b>testamentary</b> <b>letter.</b> When, in after times, Adrian's father, then king of England, felt his situation become more perilous, his line of conduct more embarrassed, again and again he wished for his early friend, who might stand a mound against the impetuous anger of his queen, a mediator {{between him and the}} parliament. From the time that he had quitted London, on the fatal night of his defeat at the gaming-table, the king had received no tidings concerning him; and when, after the lapse of years, he exerted himself to discover him, every trace was lost. With fonder regret than ever, he clung to his memory; and gave it in charge to his son, if ever he should meet this valued friend, in his name to bestow every succour, and to assure him that, to the last, his attachment survived separation and silence.|$|R
40|$|The name Évariste Galois and {{the subject}} known today as Galois theory are {{familiar}} {{to anyone who has}} studied modern algebra. In his short life of twenty years, ended following a duel in May 1832, Galois created the foundations of a large part of algebra as it is studied today, together with individual results that have never lost their sparkle. There were several French editions of his published work and other writings. These include the <b>testamentary</b> <b>letter</b> to his friend Auguste Chevalier, written {{on the eve of the}} fatal duel and published as Galois had requested in the Revue Encyclopédique in September 1832. Chevalier served as Galois’s literary executor, made copies of two of the most important unpublished works of Galois, and gave them to Joseph Liouville in 1843. Liouville published the Oeuvres Mathématiques d’Évariste Galois [10] in his Journal de Mathématiques pures et appliquées in 1846. Other editors of the Galois manuscripts were Jules Tannery, who published Manuscrits et Papiers inédits de Évariste Galois in 1906, and Robert Bourgne and Jean-Pierre Azra, whose critical edition Écrits et Mémoires Mathématiques d’Évariste Galois appeared in 1962. Translations of the manuscripts into German and Italian have appeared, along with English translations of some of them. The book that is the subject of this review, by Peter M.
