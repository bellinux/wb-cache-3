5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E

The oscillating deflection is sinusoidally carried out in a feeding direction. The laser is a high-performance-, fiber-, disk-, carbon dioxide- or diode lasers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises obtaining a maximum absorption of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> at a predetermined workpiece thickness, in which an inclination angle (phi c) of a cutting front by an adjustment of the geometry of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> using beam formation and/or a movement of the focal points of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> superimposed to the feed motion are changed, and superimposing an oscillating deflection of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> to an uniform feed motion. The oscillating deflection is sinusoidally carried out in a feeding direction. The laser is a high-performance-, fiber-, disk-, carbon dioxide- or diode lasers. The movement of the focal points is carried out, so that the inclination angle of the cutting front is permanently changed and an incident angle of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> (phi (IN)) is kept within an interval to Brewster-angle (phi (Br)). A path traverses between the two deflection points during the oscillating deflection of the focal point and {{is greater than the}} average diameter of the cross-section of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> in the focal point. The oscillating deflection is performed with a frequency of 10 - 1000 Hz, is considerably performed a saw tooth function and a triangular function in the feeding direction and is carried out in an elliptical and figure-of-eight shaped manner. The <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> is used with a rectangular or elliptical <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> cross-section. The <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> cross-section and/or the oscillation direction are adapted to the feeding direction. A cutting nozzle is adapted to the respective <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> cross-section and/or the oscillating deflection of the <b>laser</b> <b>beam,</b> is used with an aperture opening for the <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> with the rectangular or elliptical cross-section, and is considerably rotatable to the respective feeding direction.

25|$|A {{calculation}} of the MPE for ocular exposure {{takes into account the}} various ways light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, which means that the MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of spatial coherence than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the eye lens focuses the light into the smallest possible spot size on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, {{it is based on the}} power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSIZ136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.|$|E
