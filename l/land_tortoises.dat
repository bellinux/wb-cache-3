5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis <b>land</b> <b>tortoises,</b> as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.|$|E
25|$|Though {{worldwide}} in scope, the collection contains approximately 2,300 species from the Neotropics, 600 from Asia, 390 from the Nearctic, 350 from Africa, 275 from the Palearctic, and 220 from Australia/Oceania. Large holdings of <b>land</b> <b>tortoises</b> and varanid lizards resulted from Walter Auffenberg's research, {{and his work}} on the Herpetology of Pakistan produced the world's largest Pakistan collection. Large numbers of sea turtles came from Archie Carr and his students. Wayne King's surveys of Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guyana, assembled the largest collection of Latin American crocodilians. Sizable collections of Kinosternid turtles were donated by John Iverson, softshells by Peter Meylan, and Panama amphibians and reptiles by the late Howard W. Campbell. Samuel R. Telford, Jr., provided extensive collections from Japan, Burma, Panama, Venezuela, Tanzania, and Pakistan, and smaller numbers from Zaire, Thailand and the Philippines. Recorded vocalizations of 46 species of amphibians and 20 species of reptiles are catalogued in the museum's Bioacoustic Archives.|$|E

5000|$|The {{habitat of}} a sea turtle has a {{significant}} influence on its morphology. Sea turtles are able to grow so large because of the immense size of their habitat: the ocean. The reason that sea turtles are much bigger than <b>land</b> <b>tortoises</b> and freshwater turtles is directly correlated with {{the vastness of the}} ocean, {{and the fact that they}} travel such far distances, especially the leatherback sea turtles.

5000|$|Radeau <b>Land</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Shipwreck) is the Lake George {{site of a}} {{shipwreck}} {{from the}} French and Indian Wars era. The vessel is a radeau. Simple in construction, it was built by Capt. Samuel Cobb of Falmouth, now Portland, Province of Maine for the British and Colonial forces in 1758 to help combat the French in North America. She was built in just over a month, launched, tested ("rowed well with 26 oars") and then two days later intentionally sunk by adding ballast with plans to re-float her {{in the spring of}} 1759. This plan was never fulfilled, however, leaving the <b>Land</b> <b>Tortoise</b> at the bottom of Lake George for more than two centuries. [...] It {{is believed to be the}} oldest intact warship in North America, and is the only surviving ship of its type. [...] It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998.

5000|$|Though one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, the {{peninsula}} of New Farm was once called Binkinba (place of the <b>land</b> <b>tortoises)</b> by the indigenous Turrbal tribe of Brisbane.

According to a recent book, Reflections on New Farm, published by the New Farm and Districts Historical Society the area was also a working site of convicts (lime kilns dating back to 1870 are still evident on the river banks) a marine base in World War II and home to many wealthy merchants and lawyers. [...] Politician and judge Samuel Griffith built his house 'Merthyr' in the suburb in 1870.|$|E
50|$|Anonyme Island has {{abundant}} {{plant life}} including ironwood (bois noir) and banyan trees. Also several Aldabra giant tortoises make Anonyme their home.

Anonyme boasts more than its fair share of bird life, and fruit bats are also to be found along with a number of giant <b>land</b> <b>tortoises.</b> The waters surrounding this tiny island are ideal for snorkeling and the isle commands spectacular views of sunsets and the other neighboring inner islands.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} one of the rarest <b>land</b> <b>tortoises</b> in the world, {{classified}} as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The principal threats to the species are believed to be fires started to clear land for cattle grazing, and collection for the pet trade. The tortoise has a restricted distribution, likely a result of past collection for food, the expansion of agriculture, and accompanying fires. An additional threat is predation by the bushpig. Fires made to clear land can get out of control, turning into wildfires, which cut back more of the angonoka tortoise's habitat. Following efforts to create firebreaks through controlled fires in savanna fringes by conservation groups, out-of-control fires have decreased, until less than 50 ha of its habitat were burnt in 2004.|$|E
