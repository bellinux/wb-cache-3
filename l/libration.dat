Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit <b>libration.</b> This <b>libration</b> could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans do not {{maintain}} a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically {{moving closer to}} Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their <b>libration</b> is about 150 years. The amplitude of the <b>libration</b> (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known).|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the <b>libration</b> points and perturb their orbits leaving this <b>libration</b> point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E

5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of <b>libration,</b> about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above <b>libration.</b> When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This {{is known as the}} 1:1 superresonance. All the Jovian planets, particularly Jupiter, {{play a role in the}} creation of the superresonance.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a <b>libration</b> of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{coupling}} between librational {{motions and}} rotational isomeric jumps in polymers is investigated. <b>Librations</b> originate from bond stretching, bond angle distortion, and small-amplitude {{fluctuations in the}} bond dihedral angles. Molecular dynamics trajectories for a polymer chain of 100 bonds in vacuo are used for assessing the contribution of <b>librations</b> to the dynamic behavior of chains. Each trajectory is resolved into two sets of components, low and high frequency, representing bond rotameric transitions and <b>librations,</b> respectively. Librational motions are observed to be strongly correlated with the rotational jumps of bonds between isomeric states. In fact, the passage from an isomeric state to another is accompanied by an enhancement in librational motions. Examination of the contribution of <b>librations</b> to the local relaxation behavior of polymers indicates that <b>librations</b> affect the mechanism of motion via two opposing effects. On the one hand, they provide an additional degree of freedom which causes a faster relaxation of the conformational correlation functions associated with the bond dihedral angles. On the other hand, the orientational correlation functions associated with the spatial reorientation of backbone bonds exhibit a slower time decay due to the compensating effect of librational motions. In fact, librational motions are not random but highly directed such that they collectively preserve local chain direction and help in accommodating the local reorientations induced by isomeric jumps, which would otherwise result in larger displacements of chain segments. Finally, it is shown that replacing the <b>librations</b> of a trajectory with random, uncorrelated fluctuations leads to an overestimation of the relaxation rate of configurational correlations...|$|R

5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the <b>libration</b> islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate {{towards and away from}} Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal <b>libration,</b> which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal <b>libration,</b> which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of <b>libration</b> in latitude.|$|E

Also we show that they are possibly chaotic depending on two parameters: a constant $k$ related to the principal moments of inertia of the satellite, and the eccentricity $e$ of its orbit. We prove that the plane $k$-$e$ contains an open region $Omega$ with the property that the longitudinal <b>librations</b> of any satellite are possibly chaotic if the point $(k,e) $ belongs to this region. Since Hyperion's point is inside $Omega$, the results of this paper are more general than those obtained previously...|$|R

The Rayleigh wave for the CH_(3) - and CD_(3) -terminated Si(111) surfaces exhibited a nonsinusoidal line shape, which {{can be attributed to the}} hybridization of overlayer <b>librations</b> with the vibrations of the underlying substrate.

25|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation, {{meaning that}} it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times. This synchronous rotation is only true on average, because the Moon's orbit has a definite eccentricity. As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity. When the Moon is at its perigee, its rotation is slower than its orbital motion, and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern (right) far side. Conversely, when the Moon reaches its apogee, its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western (left) far side. This {{is referred to as}} longitudinal <b>libration.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} near-integer-ratio {{relationships}} between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, these have no dynamical significance {{because there is no}} appropriate precession of perihelion or other <b>libration</b> to make the resonance perfect (see the detailed discussion in the section above). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because (unlike a true resonance), after each cycle the relative position of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. The mismatch after 8 years is only 1.5° of Venus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their relative position is effectively random.|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la <b>libration</b> de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

25|$|The second {{modification}} was {{the requirement}} {{that one of the}} ice giants and Jupiter encounter Jupiter causing its semi-major axis to jump. In this jumping-Jupiter scenario an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink. This results in a step-wise separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits instead of a smooth divergent migration. The step-wise separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn avoids the slow sweeping of secular resonances across the inner solar System that resulted in the excitation of the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and an asteroid belt with an excessive ratio of high- to low-inclination objects The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in this model allow Jupiter to acquire its own irregular satellites. Jupiter trojans are also captured following these encounters when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps and, if the ice giant passes through one of the <b>libration</b> points scattering trojans, one population is depleted relative to the other. The faster traverse of the secular resonances across the asteroid belt limits the loss of asteroids from its core. Most of the rocky impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment instead originate from an inner extension that that is disrupted when the giant planets reach their current positions, with a remnant remaining as the Hungaria asteroids. Some D-type asteroids are embedded in inner asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU, during encounters with the ice giant when it is crossing the asteroid belt.|$|E
500|$|Measurements of Enceladus's [...] "wobble" [...] as it orbits Saturn—called libration—suggests {{that the}} entire icy crust is {{detached}} from the rocky core and therefore that a global ocean is present beneath the surface.

500|$|Because of {{its small}} {{separation}} from Gliese 581, the planet has been {{generally considered to}} always have one hemisphere facing the star (only day), and the other always facing away (only night), or in other words being tidally locked. [...] The most recent orbital fit to the system, taking stellar activity into account indicates a circular orbit, but older fits use an eccentricity between 0.10 and 0.22. If the orbit of the planet were eccentric, it would undergo violent tidal flexing. Because tidal forces are stronger when the planet {{is close to the}} star, eccentric planets are expected to have a rotation period which is shorter than its orbital period, also called pseudo-synchronization. An example of this effect is seen in Mercury, which is tidally locked in a 3:2 resonance, completing three rotations every two orbits. In any case, even in the case of 1:1 tidal lock, the planet would undergo <b>libration</b> and the terminator would be alternatively lit and darkened during <b>libration.</b>|$|E
