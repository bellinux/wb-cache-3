He made a great riot at the lodge-gate to the keeper's wife (who, being a West-country woman, did not understand his English or his Gascon French), {{because there was no}} carriage in waiting to drive him to the house, a mile off, and because he could not walk entire leagues in his fatigued state and varnished boots. This was Monsieur Alcide Mirobolant, formerly Chef of his Highness the Duc de Borodino, of H. Eminence Cardinal Beccafico, and at present Chef of the bouche of Sir Clavering, Baronet:--Monsieur Mirobolant's <b>library,</b> <b>pictures,</b> and piano had arrived previously in charge of the intelligent young Englishman, his aide-de-camp. He was, moreover, aided by a professed female cook, likewise from London, who had inferior females under her orders.|$|E

50|$|Sutton {{retired from}} the RAF on 7 June 1945, {{just prior to the}} end of World War II. Sutton made Little Park Farm at Crookham Common, which is near Newbury in Berkshire, his home and he planned to enjoy his <b>library,</b> <b>pictures,</b> and garden. However, by this time Sutton was not in good health and he died just over a year later on 28 September 1946.|$|E
5000|$|The {{historical}} {{architecture of}} the town centre {{is one of the}} major attractions of Køge. The oldest dated half-timbered house in Denmark, which is also the oldest dated non-nobility and non-religious building of the nordic countries, can be found in Køge. It was built in 1527. Originally a section of a row of , it is now a part of the public <b>library.</b> <b>Pictures</b> can be found in the gallery. The Third largest Viking Ring Fortress was found near the city of Køge, Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Sisterdale {{was one of}} the Latin Settlements, {{resulting}} from the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Those who came were Forty-Eighters, intellectual liberal abolitionists who enjoyed conversing in Latin and believed in utopian ideals that guaranteed basic human rights to all. They reveled in passionate conversations about literature, music and philosophy. The free thinkers petitioned the Texas Congress in 1853 for a charter to operate a German-English college to be built at Sisterdale, but the petition did not come to fruition. Visitors to Behr's Sisterdale home included Duke Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg, John Russell Bartlett, and Frederick Law Olmsted, who admired his lending <b>library,</b> <b>pictures,</b> and harpsichord.|$|E

5000|$|Stock footage, and similarly, archive footage, <b>library</b> <b>pictures,</b> {{and file}} footage is film or video footage {{that can be}} used again in other films. Stock footage is {{beneficial}} to filmmakers as it saves shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is called a [...] "stock shot" [...] or a [...] "library shot". Stock footage may have appeared in previous productions but may also be outtakes or footage shot for previous productions and not used. Examples of stock footage which might be utilized are moving images of cities and landmarks, wildlife in their natural environments, and historical footage. Suppliers of stock footage may be either rights managed or royalty-free. Many websites offer direct downloads of clips in various formats.|$|E
5000|$|Development of {{the second}} {{underwater}} game named Creation began around November 1993, and the development team was led by Phil Jones. Molyneux believed that the game would be [...] "more exciting" [...] than Magic Carpet and Theme Park, which were in development at the time. To get the underwater scenery correct, Jones worked form <b>library</b> <b>pictures.</b> By January 1994, Creation was a base defence game in which {{the goal was to}} defend against other bases, and there were around ten species of fish which took around 80 to 120kb of memory. The game used the same graphics system as Magic Carpet, and as Magic Carpet evolved, Creations graphics were backwards engineered. An idea being explored was the possibility of linking Creation and Magic Carpet together: Magic Carpet would have had the player be able to jump into the water, and it would detect whether Creation was installed and load it if so, with the world being based on the Magic Carpet one the player had just left. Coming out of the water would send the player back.|$|E
5000|$|PVS News, the earnest, no-frills network. The set, presentation, and {{on screen}} {{graphics}} mirror that of BBC News 24. The main anchors are Adam Lockwood and Frances Walsh (Clare Wille) (reportedly born {{within minutes of}} each other and have been indistinguishable ever since) whose running gag is to complete each other's words and sentences. The station features live links to various locations, with international correspondent Will Parker (Benedict Cumberbatch). The station uses poor quality live satellite links to locations where events have not occurred yet ("Donald Rumsfeld is very much his own man, and people here are talking about what he will not say as much as what he will say when he does turn up. He will probably not say what we expect him to say, because that's not his style") and covers unimportant stories too, just to fill up the time ("Due to a debate between TV producers and librarians, news channels cannot shoot new footage of libraries. These <b>library</b> <b>pictures</b> were shot months ago.") The field reporters often ask the main anchors [...] "What more can you tell us" [...] - a complete role reversal.|$|E
