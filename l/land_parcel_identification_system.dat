The <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> (LPIS) are established in all MS as a state register and evidence a new kind of land management in the agricultural sector. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to study institutional requirements of the EU regulatory framework and (ii) to introduce the framework of conceptual modelling and methodological approaches for standardisation in this sector domain. This paper addresses the recent challenges for LPIS geographic data, such as operating within a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and its requirements for data harmonisation and interoperability. The core LPIS Conceptual Model (LCM) that represents conceptual compliance with the EU regulations is introduced. The first-cut LCM described in this paper is the initial step on the way to standardization in the IACS Spatial Data Interest Community (Devos et al, 2007). The LCM is generated by means of both (i) methodological approaches of International Standards of ISO 19100 series and the INSPIRE principles and (ii) reverse engineering of existing operational systems.

In order to administrate and to control the farmers ' declarations, the EU decided to establish an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in 1992. Over the years it was found, that the declared areas often do not represent the reality. As a result, the process of declaration should be improved by the establishment of a <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System,</b> preferably based on orthophotos. This identification system has to be developed and established before 1. 1. 2005 and has to be updated at least every five years. In this paper an updating process based on image classification and change detection is investigated. For this purpose the usefulness of the most common commercial highresolution satellite systems as well as newly developed airborne camera systems is discussed. In order to get reliable information about agricultural parcels areas, the images have to be rectified. Problems in image rectification are outlined and a classification case study using the eCognition software shows chances and limits for land parcel update.

40|$|To date, the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System</b> (LPIS) {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as the foundation for}} effective spatial management of agriculture and the environment and many land managers have suggested incorporating it in most of the instruments for sustainable agriculture. The LPIS is originally used for registration of agricultural reference parcels considered eligible for annual payments of European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies to farmers. Its intrinsic quality depends on the frequency and magnitude of the discrepancies in area, since some parcels can be under- or over-declared by farmers compared with reference registered within the LPIS. General application of the LPIS therefore depends on our capacity to ¿ first identify and explain the causes of these area discrepancies perceived as anomalies by national CAP payment agencies ¿second, to propose future improvements in its overall quality. From a set of images used during the 2005 Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) campaign, using the geographic information system (GIS) and ecological methodologies we assessed the quality of the LPIS by identifying the diversity of the existing anomalies. To that end, the ecological sampling method was adapted to the specific case of image-based detection of anomalies. The observed anomalies assemblages obtained from a set of European Member States representing the four types of LPIS were analysed to establish the spatial pattern of the anomalies. We showed that the twelve zones surveyed can be grouped into four different clusters, each individually correlated with the presence of certain categories of LPIS anomaly. Some clusters were more particularly related to the presence of natural and anthropogenic landscape features, whereas others were typified by anomalies which stemmed from the process for creating and updating the LPIS, which accounted for 20 % of the anomalies detected. Finally, we also showed that, even if useful for establishing procedures to manage the LPIS, the LPIS typology used in the European Union had no effect on the anomalies assemblage or on the spatial pattern; consequently, the type of LPIS no longer needs to be considered and LPIS anomalies assemblages could be pooled across Europe. In the light of the results obtained, different proposals are made to improve LPIS quality by: ¿ identifying the critical points along the LPIS management chain; ¿ using landscape ecological methodologies to explain the causes of the clusters observed; and ¿ extrapolating the whole results in the CwRS risk analysis to perform ex-ante LPIS anomalies risk map.

Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches {{have been based}} on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence {{at the level of the}} farmer's block as mapped in the French <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of “marginal land” by integrating also the farm management criteria. In conclusion, our approach elicited real farmers' criteria regarding miscanthus location to capture local specificities and explore different miscanthus location probabilities at the farm and landscape levels...|$|E

40|$|Countries in EU {{have been}} using Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in order to {{administer}} agricultural subsidies since 1992. In time, IACS experienced some major changes indicating the usage of concrete spatial reference systems. In this context, <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> (LPISs) emerged in order mainly to spatially represent the activities of farmers on their lands. LPIS requires the usage of orthophotos or orthoimagery as a basic guidance and sometimes uses cadastre coverage as an ancillary data source in demarcating agricultural parcels {{in conjunction with the}} declarations by farmers. These systems cover only agricultural areas. They mainly records agricultural land use information declared by farmers rather than land tenure information. The main reason for using such a system rather than using land records under land administration authorities is that land records were not readily available for the majority of countries. Another reason for that is the so-called complexity of both these land records and related administrations. The LPISs of this kind are regarded as easy to build, update and manage, and also low cost systems.

For this purpose, Member States (MS) are expected to establish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), including a <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System</b> (LPIS) as the spatial part of IACS. Different MS have chosen different solutions for their LPIS. Currently, some MS based their IACS/LPIS on data from their Land Administration Systems (LAS), and many others use purpose built special systems for their IACS/LPIS. The issue with different IACS/LPIS is {{that they do not have}} standardized structures; rather, each represents a unique design in each MS, both in the case of LAS or special systems. In this study, we aim at designing a core data model for those IACS/LPIS based on LAS.

40|$|Since its {{creation}} {{in the late}} 1950 ’s, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has shaped the European agriculture. In tandem, the CAP has evolved {{through a series of}} reforms in order to adapt to the changing needs of both agriculture and society as a whole. Today, rural areas still cover 90 % of the EU territory, of which more than half is farmed. Also, the CAP {{is one of the most}} significant policy instruments in financial terms. In order to ensure that these funds are spent appropriately, Member State Authorities and the Commission services have to establish and apply appropriate management and control mechanisms. During the past decade, CAP legislative requirements have evolved towards geo-referenced, on-line, information that is supported by up-to-date nationwide image datasets, and consolidated in the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). This evolution has been facilitated and pushed by technical innovations in geospatial and geomatics domains. To date, the control with remote sensing (CwRS), Digital <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System</b> (LPIS), and parcel area measurement using GNSS devices are the keystones of the efficient administration and control of CAP subsidies.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the new CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) of the European Union is the enhancement of environmental performance through a mandatory "greening" component of direct payments, which will support agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment. A part of the financial support that farmers receive will be linked to simple, generalized, non-contractual farming practices that go beyond cross-compliance, such as crop diversification, the maintenance of permanent grassland, and the establishment of ecological focus areas. In order to better achieve {{the objectives}} of "greening" and to allow for its efficient administration and control, these practices are implemented {{depending on the size of}} the eligible area declared by the farmer and are compared to the whole area held by the applicant. The compulsory nature of those practices should also concern farmers whose lands are fully or partly situated in "Natura 2000 " areas. The implementation of the "greening" component in the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> (LPIS) is a challenge to be further analyzed according to their specific conditions. All spatial objects of the "greening" category should be identifiable, measurable, locatable and stable in time, which allow efficient controls. This article addresses the geospatial nature of the LPIS „greening“ component and introduces possible monitoring, measuring and control methods for the related elements and practices.

40|$|Most {{land cover}} mapping {{initiatives}} have been biased towards optimized data capture and cartographic quality. Interoperability {{of the resulting}} data has proven difficult due to the semantic ambiguity embedded in the classification and methodology of each initiative, which often does not correctly reflect and account for the complexity and specificity of the landscape under observation. This chapter describes how the tegon concept can model land cover as a real world phenomenon. Tegons are instances of the elementary physical components behind any existing mapping unit or legend class, expressed in the Land Cover Meta Language, specified in ISO 19144 - 2. Two large scale examples from an agricultural context show how the concept {{has been used for}} demarcating the land cover universe of discourse and for harmonization efforts. The tegon concept was developed by the Monitoring of Agriculture ResourceS (MARS) Unit of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and first applied during 2010 quality assessment of the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> (LPIS). This exercise required a full description of the European agriculture land cover types of all Member States (MS), based on the FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). Later, its application has been expanded towards cross-border land monitoring initiatives, such as the project SPATIAL involving Bulgaria and Romania, where the tegon concept became the key methodological instrument for the land cover inventory and spatial data harmonization to cover the entire cross-border area representing a major part of Lower Danube Basin. Both application experiences demonstrate the high potential of the concept, in particular for addressing complex land cover phenomena and for insuring interoperability between existing classifications and their data sets. This potential is most evident at large scale data. Automation of the tegon modeling will be required to verify the claim of exhaustiveness and universality at these scales. Application of tegon conceptualization during the inception of new classifications or data sets should introduce the correct semantics in those initiatives. However, as tegon modeling in itself does not address the limitations of current data capture methodologies, impact for ongoing inventories will be limited to improving semantic interoperability.

The objective of the study is to develop a change detection method that could be used as an aid in the updating of the FLPIS. The method is based on object-based interpretation, and it uses existing parcel boundaries and new aerial ortho images as input data. Rules for classifying field and non-field objects are defined automatically by using the classification tree method and training data. Additional, manually created rules are used to improve the results. Classification tests carried out during the development work suggest that real changes can be detected relatively well. According to a recent visual evaluation, 96 % of changes larger than 100 m 2 were detected, at least partly. The overall accuracy of the change detection results was 93 % when compared with reference data pixel-by-pixel. On the other hand, there are also missing changes and numerous false alarms. The main challenges encountered in the method development include the wide diversity of agricultural fields and other land cover objects locally, across the country, and at different times of the spring and summer, variability in the digital numbers (DNs) of the aerial images, the different nature of visual and automatic interpretation, and the small percentage of the total field area that has really changed.

30|$|Since {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, one of the main application areas of remote sensing in agriculture in Europe has been the control of area-based agricultural subsidies given to the farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) [1]. For many years, this activity, also referred to as controls with remote sensing (CwRS), has consisted in checking whether the area and the crop type declared by the farmer are in line with the real situation as identified mainly from satellite remote sensing data. In the early years, when the identification of crop types was very important, both computer aided photo-interpretation methods (CAPI) and automatic classification procedures were involved in CwRS. Recent changes in the CAP decreased the importance of crop-type identification during the control procedure, while increasing the importance of the detection of anomalies related to the compliance with the rules defined as good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). While CwRS covers the control aspect of the CAP management there is another important element: the <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> (LPIS). The LPIS is the so called reference system for locating and identifying each agricultural parcel in the EU that is declared in the farmers’ annual applications. The LPIS has to be as up to date as possible in order to reflect the real situation on the ground inside the LPIS parcels in terms of the correct quantification of the maximum eligible area in each LPIS parcel. For identification of these parcels, the use of digital geographic information system (GIS) techniques has been compulsory since January 2005, by a legislation change in 2000 [2].|$|E
40|$|After its 2016 {{performance}} audit on the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System</b> (LPIS), the European Court of Auditors {{recommended that the}} Commission should carry out a cost-benefit analysis {{in order to determine}} whether the representativeness of QA samples could be improved so that a better coverage of the population of parcels in LPIS be achieved. This report holds the results of that analysis. An appropriate indicator for representativeness was developed and benchmarked. That indicator, “percentage of the population in the 95 % central probability interval (PCPI) ” was then applied to the actual samples of the past to measure their performance. Additionally, the simulation of several sampling scenarios allowed to assess whether sub-optimal conditions could be remediated by the appropriate mitigation measures. The results reconfirmed that the initial approach of spatial stratification does not interfere with the representativeness in se, but it also found that the current implementation could leave a few territories with some residual effect from the implied spatial clustering. This potential weakness was addressed by improving the resolution of the stratification control layer, ensuring a minimum set of clusters as well as introducing stratified random sampling. Simulations demonstrated these combined remedies were effective for nearly all Member States and regions. Cyprus and Luxemburg missed the target, but only just. The revised methodology led to a 15 percent increase of the number of control zones over Europe, but did not require any procedural modification or other additional inspection workload for the Member States. This revised sampling methodology thus considers the Court’s cost-benefit concerns and has been fully implemented for the 2017 LPIS QA campaign. JRC. D. 5 -Food Securit...|$|E
40|$|The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) is a Draft International Standard (ISO DIS 19152) and in January 2011 was {{distributed}} by the ISO central secretariat for a five month voting and commenting time interval. If everything goes as planned, ISO 19152 will be an International Standard (IS) by 2012. In this paper the road towards this standard is briefly described. An overview of the DIS and the changes {{during the last year}} of the LADM standardization process is given; most of the changes are textual and organizational improvements. With the official status of the LADM as an International Standard approaching, the question arises: what’s next? The answer is of course, implementation and use in practice. Already several country profiles have been created and other model usage is being conducted; e. g. the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> of the European Union and the Social Tenure Domain Model. It was noted in earlier publications that Land Administration is key in the information infrastructure and strongly related to other registrations. Within LADM these registrations are explicitly indicated as external classes, such as persons (parties), addresses, valuation, taxation, land use, coverage, physical utility networks, etc. Within the European Union, some of these domains are treated in INSPIRE, but certainly not all. Here lies an important role for FIG at a global scale (and with a relationship to ISO). Also, FIG could continue the work of ISO on Observations & Measurements (ISO 19156, under development) and make sure that this standard is refined for cadastral surveying needs. The requirements from future land governance stem from improving registration of public restrictions, registration of public benefits, registration practices with regard to public land, registration of ‘public goods’ and its spatial extents and policy implications. In the past, there have been more publications on the anticipated developments of Land Administration, see (Van der Molen, 2003) and more recently (Bennett et al, 2010; Lemmens, 2010 a; Lemmens, 2010 b). The expected further requirements for the next decade are support of: mature information infrastructures to serve society; dynamic process models with updating/participation by actors; 3 D, 4 D and 5 D that is, space, time and scale integrated in Land Administration; spatial design applications; new rights, restrictions and responsibilities; international semantic web-based seamless registration; monitoring applications and community driven cadastral mapping. LADM can bring support here from a modeling perspective. OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|The impact {{assessment}} of the environmental policy integration into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU requires combination of data on bio-physical and economical conditions as well as data on agricultural practice. A major restriction for comparative assessment is that data sources are collected, managed and distributed by different institutions and those datasets are not harmonised across Europe. The challenge is to allocate macro-economic statistics to the farm on landscape level. In this paper we investigate the potentials {{for use of the}} CAP administrative datasets in the development of environmental indicators. The basic concepts of the Integrated Administrative and Control Systems (IACS) datasets and common core model are described.

40|$|An {{important}} government {{activity for}} all nation states is building {{and maintaining a}} land administration system (LAS) with the primary objective of supporting an efficient and effective land market. This usually includes cadastral surveys to identify and subdivide land, land registry systems to support simple land trading (buying, selling, mortgaging and leasing land) and land information systems to facilitate access to the relevant information, increasingly through an Internet enabled e-government environment. For most countries a cadastre {{is at the core}} of the LAS providing spatial integrity and unique <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification</b> in support of security of tenure and effective land trading. For many cadastral and land administration officials and for much of society, these are the primary, and in many cases the only roles of the cadastre and LAS. However the role, and particularly the potential of LAS and their core cadastres, have rapidly expanded over the last couple of decades and will continue to change in the future. Cadastres provide the location or place for many activities in the built environment through the cadastral map. This in turn provides the spatial enablement of the broader lan...|$|R
40|$|An {{agricultural}} monitoring {{project has}} been carried out in Finland in the framework of ESA’s Envisat Announcement of Opportunity (EAO- 488). The project started in spring 2003 when a test area was selected near the city of Seinäjoki in South Ostrobothnia, which is located in the western Finland at the latitude of 63 º North. South Ostrobothnia is one of the northernmost consistent agricultural areas in the world. The main crops, approximately 50 % of all parcels, are barley and oats, which are sown in springtime, but there are also small areas of wheat and rye. Altogether 16 alternating polarization SAR images (VV/VH) were requested from the growing season in 2003, from which 12 images were acquired. Simultaneously with image acquisition, we collected field measurements of growing stage, crop height and soil surface moisture. Soil surface roughness was measured {{in the beginning of the}} growing season before the emerging of the crops. The topography of the area is flat, thus, the effect of land slope is negligible. Information about test parcels, such as crop species and parcel boundaries, were acquired from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which maintains the <b>Land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> (LPIS) in Finland. A Finnish company Kemira Agro Oy provided us test parcels for more detailed research from their Kemira LORIS precision farming system. All SAR images were orthorectified into the Finnish uniform coordinate system and time series of average backscattering were calculated for each of the test parcels. The results of the multiple linear regression modelling for estimating the crop growth from backscattering are presented in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|For almost 10 years JRC's ¿Guidelines for Best Practice and Quality Control of Ortho Imagery¿ {{has served}} as a {{reference}} document for the production of orthoimagery not only for the purposes of CAP but also for many medium-to-large scale photogrammetric applications. The aim is to provide the European Commission and the remote sensing user community with a general framework of the best approaches for quality checking of orthorectified remotely sensed imagery, and the expected best practice, required to achieve good results. Since the last major revision (2003) the document was regularly updated in order to include state-of-the-art technologies. The major revision of the document was initiated last year in order to consolidate the information that was introduced to the document in the last five years. Following the internal discussion and the outcomes of the meeting with an expert panel it was decided to adopt as possible a process-based structure instead of a more sensor-based used before and also to keep the document as much generic as possible by focusing on the core aspects of the photogrammetric process. Additionally to any structural changes in the document new information was introduced mainly concerned with image resolution and radiometry, digital airborne sensors, data fusion, mosaicking and data compression. The Guidelines of best practice is used as the base for our work on the definition of technical specifications for the orthoimagery. The scope is to establish a core set of measures to ensure sufficient image quality for the purposes of CAP and particularly for the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>System</b> (PLIS), and also to define the set of metadata necessary for data documentation and overall job tracking.

40|$|Highlights • Farmers' {{criteria}} to locate real miscanthus fields were investigated. • We modelled agronomic, morphological and contextual field characteristics. • Boosted regression tree method used to upscale from supply {{area to the}} regional level. • Small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks resulted to be relevant to locate miscanthus. • Our approach provided miscanthus location probabilities from farm to landscape levels. Abstract. Miscanthus is an emerging crop with high potential for bioenergy production. Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches {{have been based on}} real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence {{at the level of the}} farmer's block as mapped in the French <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of “marginal land” by integrating also the farm management criteria. In conclusion, our approach elicited real farmers' criteria regarding miscanthus location to capture local specificities and explore different miscanthus location probabilities at the farm and landscape levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{vision of}} a {{spatially}} enabled government involves establishing an enabling infrastructure to facilitate use of place or location to organise information about activities of people and businesses, and about government actions, decisions and polices. Once the infrastructure is built, spatial enablement allows government information and services, business transactions and community activities to be linke d to places or locations. Given the potential of new technologies, use of place or location will facilitate the evaluation and analysis of both spatial and non-spatial relationships between people, business transactions and government. Most governments already have considerable infrastructure and administrative systems for better management of land and resources. Basic information creating processes are cadastral surveying that identifies land and running a digital cadastral database (DCDB) providing the spatial integrity and unique <b>land</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>identification,</b> registering <b>land</b> that supports simple land trading (buying, selling, mortgaging and leasing land); running land information systems (LIS); and geographic information systems (GIS) that provide mappin g and resource information.

40|$|When {{the current}} {{situation}} {{in the rural areas}} of the EU is considered, {{it is a fact that}} there are two separated spatial data bases; Land Administration Systems (LASs) and Integrated Administration and Control Systems/Land <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Systems</b> (IACS/LPISs). They may handle different aspects of the rural land and population, but their target objects–rural land and population–are the same. This situation may be caused by varying scopes of LASs throughout the European Union (EU). This study is aimed at analyzing a number of solutions to the problem of different, but related systems. For this purpose, the two extreme alternatives are discussed. As the first alternative a theoretical approach is introduced as an ideal system. In this case, in a LAS-land <b>parcel,</b> different <b>land</b> use types can be represented as sub-parcels. However, due to the fact that the current systems are far from this theoretical approach, a more practical approach is also introduced. In this approach, a case study (in two different case study areas) in the Netherlands is carried out with a focus on the extent to which the geometry between the two systems is shared (or at least strongly related). In addition to that, the extent to which the administrative information content of the two business processes is shared is also analyzed a...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the use of}} IACS {{and other}} datasets for reporting and accounting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and removals in the land use sector. The land use sector comprises land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as well as agriculture, jointly referred to as agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Decision 529 / 2013 /EU of the European Council and the Parliament of 21 May 2013 brings the LULUCF sector in the EU emission accounting obligations. These new accounting obligations for EU member states are phased in over a period extending to 2022. This Report, as part of work performed by the JRC for DG Climate Action under an Administrative Arrangement (AA), aims at exploring the usefulness for cropland management (CM) and grazing land management (GM) accounting of the vast amount of data already regularly collected on the EU level {{in the context of}} environmental and agricultural policies. One of the most promising datasets to meet LULUCF reporting obligations is the “Integrated Administration and Control System” (IACS) that has been set up by all member states to manage the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy, and its GIS, “the <b>Land</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>Identification</b> System” (LPIS). The data the LPIS holds are geo-referenced polygons of <b>land</b> <b>parcels</b> (units of management or production), and information on the type of land cover, as a minimum in terms of broad categories such as arable land, grassland, permanent crops, and broad families of crops, with their area (eligible hectares). The LPIS is a pan-EU database that provides very detailed and accurate information on the status of agricultural land cover at any given time since 2005. The potential of the LPIS to efficiently track land use changes is derived from its pan-European semantic definition of agricultural land cover types, and the mandatory adequate update cycle of the dataset. This study assessed other potential datasets, including Eurostat “Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey” (LUCAS); the Farm Structure Surveys (FSS); the Farm Accountancy Data Network; CORINE Land Cover.
