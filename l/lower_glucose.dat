25|$|Insulin is {{released}} into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by {{about two-thirds of the}} body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage. <b>Lower</b> <b>glucose</b> levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose.

50|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that interval training assists in managing {{risk factors of}} many diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes.

5000|$|Several {{studies have}} shown acute {{peripheral}} administration of PYY3-36 inhibits feeding of rodents and primates. Other studies on Y2R-knockout mice have shown no anorectic effect on them. These findings indicate PYY3-36 has an anorectic (losing appetite) effect, which is suggested to be mediated by Y2R. PYY-knockout female mice increase in body weight and fat mass. PYY-knockout mice, on the other hand, are resistant to obesity, but have higher fat mass and <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> tolerance when fed a high-fat diet, compared to control mice.

50|$|Insulin is {{essential}} in triggering the sympathoadrenal system (the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine) to respond to hypoglycemia, which then raises glucagon levels. The insulin present in the brain acts on {{the central nervous system}} by crossing the blood-brain barrier and affecting the sympathetic nervous system. Thereby, helping to initiate a response to hypoglycemia through the sympathoadrenal system. Individuals with hypoglycemia should self-monitor their blood glucose level and can take glucose in the forms of tablets or foods high in glucose. Parenteral therapy may be necessary for severe hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) can occur if left untreated. The sympathoadrenal system activity is significantly reduced because the changed glycemic threshold allows for <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> concentrations. Glucose cannot effectively regulate itself, decreasing epinephrine responses.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Circulating glucose {{inhibits}} glucose {{production in}} normal rodents and humans, but this glucose effectiveness is disrupted in diabetes due partly to sustained hyperglycemia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Metabolism of {{long-chain}} {{fatty acids}} within the duodenum {{leads to the}} activation of duodenal mucosal protein kinase C (PKC) -d and the cholecystokinin (CCK) -A receptor to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production through a neuronal network. However, the interfunctional relationship between duodenal PKC-d and CCK remains elusive. Although long-chain fatty acids activate PKC to stimulate the release of CCK in CCK-secreting cells, CCK has also been found to activate PKC-d in pancreatic acinar cells. We here evaluate whether activation of duodenal mucosal PKC-d lies up-stream (and/or downstream) of CCK signaling to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We first determined with immunofluorescence whether PKC-d and CCKwere colocalized within the duodenal mucosa.

40|$|SummaryCholecystokinin (CCK) is a {{peptide hormone}} that is {{released}} from the gut in response to nutrients such as lipids to lower food intake. Here we report that a primary increase of CCK- 8, the biologically active form of CCK, in the duodenum lowers glucose production independent of changes in circulating insulin levels. Furthermore, we show that duodenal CCK- 8 requires the activation of the gut CCK-A receptor and a gut-brain-liver neuronal axis to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production. Finally, duodenal CCK- 8 fails to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production in the early onset of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. These findings reveal a role for gut CCK that lowers glucose production through a neuronal network and suggest that intestinal CCK resistance may contribute to hyperglycemia in response to high-fat feeding...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe fat-derived hormone leptin binds to its {{hypothalamic}} receptors {{to regulate}} glucose homeostasis. Leptin is also synthesized {{in the stomach}} and subsequently binds to its receptors expressed in the intestine, although the functional relevance of such activation remains largely unknown.

40|$|Diabetes is {{characterized}} by hyperglycemia due partly to increased hepatic glucose production. The hypothalamus regulates hepatic glucose production in rodents. However, it is currently unknown whether {{other regions of the}} brain are sufficient in glucose production regulation. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is composed of NR 1 and NR 2 subunits, which are activated by co-agonist glycine and glutamate or aspartate, respectively. Here we report that direct administration of either co-agonist glycine or NMDA into the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), targeting the nucleus of the solitary tract, lowered glucose production in vivo. Direct infusion of the NMDA receptor blocker MK- 801 into the DVC negated the metabolic effect of glycine. To evaluate whether NR 1 subunit of the NMDA receptor mediates the effect of glycine, NR 1 in the DVC was inhibited by DVC NR 1 antagonist 7 -chlorokynurenic acid or DVC shRNA-NR 1. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of DVC NR 1 negated the metabolic effect of glycine. To evaluate whether the NMDA receptors mediate the effects of NR 2 agonist NMDA, DVC NMDA receptors were inhibited by antagonist d- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (d-APV). DVC d-APV fully negated the ability of DVC NMDA to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production. Finally, hepatic vagotomy negated the DVC glycine ability to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production. These findings demonstrate that activation of NR 1 and NR 2 subunits of the NMDA receptors in the DVC is sufficient to trigger a brain-liver axis to <b>lower</b> <b>glucose</b> production, and suggest that DVC NMDA receptors serve as a therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity...|$|E
