5|$|Chromium {{minerals}} as pigments came to {{the attention}} of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact crocoite (lead chromate) with a formula of PbCrO4.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence <b>lead</b> <b>compound.</b> Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E

5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
25|$|These {{could be}} applied in three {{different}} ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|E

2500|$|Thalidomide was {{discovered}} by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal (now Grünenthal GmbH) around 1953.

Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program.

2500|$|In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{held that}} two Bayer patents on Avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by Dr. Reddy's ANDA for a generic version of Avelox. The {{district}} court sided with Bayer, citing the Federal Circuit's prior decision in Takeda v.

[...] According to Bayer's press release announcing the court's decision, it was noted that Teva had also challenged the validity of the same Bayer patents at issue in the Dr. Reddy's case. Within Bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter Bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two Bayer patents. Under the settlement terms agreed upon, Teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the U.S. shortly before the second of the two Bayer patents expires in March 2014.

EPA has also decided {{that it would be}} inappropriate to develop a reference dose (RfD) for inorganic <b>lead</b> (and <b>lead</b> <b>compounds)</b> because some of the health effects associated with exposure to lead occur at blood lead levels as low as to be essentially without a threshold (IRIS 2005).
