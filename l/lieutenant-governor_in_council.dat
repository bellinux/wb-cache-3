5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{had forced}} Aberhart to abdicate {{a portion of}} his power to the newly created Social Credit Board, which {{consisted}} of five Social Credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts. While the initial plan was to have this commission headed by C. H. Douglas, social credit's British founder, Douglas did not like Aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form. He refused to come. Instead, he sent two subordinates, L. D. Byrne and G. F. Powell. These surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in Alberta. Their first round of proposals, which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging the constitutionality of any Alberta law in court without receiving the approval of the <b>Lieutenant-Governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council,</b> was disallowed by the federal government. The second round included the Accurate News and Information Act.|$|E

500|$|Byrne and Powell {{prepared}} three acts for {{the implementation}} of social credit: the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act, and the Judicature Act Amendment Act. The first required all bankers to obtain a license from the Social Credit Commission and created a directorate for the control of each bank, most members of which would be appointed by the Social Credit Board. The second prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions. The third prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's laws in court without receiving the approval of the <b>Lieutenant-Governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council.</b> All three acts were quickly passed. New Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, asked to grant royal assent, called Aberhart and Attorney-General Hugill to his office. He asked Hugill if, as a lawyer, he believed that the proposed laws were constitutional; Hugill replied that he did not. Aberhart said that he would take responsibility for the bills, which Bowen then signed. As they left the meeting, Aberhart asked Hugill for his resignation, which he received. Shortly after, the federal government disallowed all three acts. Powell was not discouraged, stating that the acts [...] "had been drawn up mainly to show the people of Alberta who were their real enemies, and in that respect they succeeded admirably." ...|$|E
