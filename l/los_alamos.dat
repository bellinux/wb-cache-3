5|$|Alvin Cushman Graves (November 4, 1909 – July 19, 1965) was an American nuclear {{physicist}} {{who served}} at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory and the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory criticality accident in <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|April 1: <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> {{laboratory}} is established.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{retired as}} {{director}} of <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in 1970. His successor, Harold Agnew, invited {{him to become a}} senior consultant, but Bradbury declined the offer, although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies, including the National Academy of Sciences, and {{as a member of the}} boards of the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Medical Center, the First National Bank of Santa Fe, the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> YMCA and the Santa Fe Neurological Society.|$|E
5|$|Colonel John M. Harman was {{the first}} post {{commander}} at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> He joined the Santa Fe office as a lieutenant colonel on 19 January 1943, and was promoted to colonel on 15 February. <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> officially became a military establishment on 1 April 1943, and he moved to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> on 19 April. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel C. Whitney Ashbridge, {{a graduate of the}} <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Ranch School, in May 1943. In turn, Ashbridge was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Gerald R. Tyler in October 1944, Colonel Lyle E. Seaman in November 1945, and Colonel Herb C. Gee in September 1946. The post commander was answerable directly to Groves, and was responsible for the township, government property and the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|February 2: First Hanford {{plutonium}} {{arrives at}} <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b>|$|E
5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> on 13 December 1943. At <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{almost all}} {{research}} at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> was redirected to the implosion-type plutonium weapon. Overall {{responsibility for the}} uranium gun-type weapon was assigned to Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division. All the design, development, and technical work at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group.|$|E
5|$|July 10: First {{sample of}} {{plutonium}} arrives at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b>|$|E
5|$|May 10: Second {{meeting of}} the Target Committee, at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reines, F., Cowan, C. L. Jr., Carter, R. E., Wagner, J. J. & M. E. Wyman. , <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory (LANL) (through {{predecessor}} agency <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Scientific Laboratory), United States Department of Energy (through predecessor agency the Atomic Energy Commission), (June 1958).|$|E
5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
5|$|April 20: The University of California {{becomes the}} formal {{business}} {{manager of the}} <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Charles Critchfield {{is buried}} {{next to his}} wife, Jean, in Guaje Pines Cemetery in <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> County, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{an offer}} from Norris Bradbury, who had {{replaced}} Oppenheimer {{as the director of}} <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> in November 1945, to become the head of the Theoretical (T) Division, Teller left <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> on February 1, 1946, to return to the University of Chicago as a professor and close associate of Fermi and Goeppert-Mayer. Mayer's work on the internal structure of the elements would earn her the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Fitch, V. , <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory, United States Department of Energy (through {{predecessor}} agency the Atomic Energy Commission), (March 16, 1949).|$|E
5|$|In May 1943, Bainbridge joined Robert Oppenheimer's Project Y at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> He {{initially}} led E-2, the instrumentation group, {{which developed}} X-ray instrumentation for examining explosions. In March 1944, he became {{head of a}} new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first nuclear test. In Oppenheimer's sweeping reorganization of the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, Oppenheimer asked Segrè to {{join the}} Manhattan Project at its <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Instead of the {{seafaring}} assignment {{he hoped}} for, Reynolds {{was sent to}} the Manhattan Project's <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky {{in the design of the}} explosive lenses required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. In April 1944, Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b>|$|E
5|$|January 11: A special {{group of}} the Theoretical Division is created at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> under Edward Teller to study implosion.|$|E
5|$|July 20: The <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> {{organizational}} structure is completely changed {{to reflect the}} new priority.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence began {{converting}} his old 37-inch cyclotron {{into a giant}} mass spectrometer. On his recommendation, {{the director}} of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., appointed Oppenheimer as head of its <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in New Mexico. While the Radiation laboratory developed the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process, the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory designed and constructed the atomic bombs. Like the Radiation Laboratory, it was run by the University of California.|$|E
5|$|November 16: Groves and Oppenheimer visit <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> New Mexico and {{designate}} it as {{the location}} for Site Y.|$|E
5|$|October 16: Oppenheimer resigns as {{director}} of <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> and is succeeded by Norris Bradbury the next day.|$|E
5|$|September 22: First RaLa {{test with}} a {{radioactive}} source performed at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a {{third of}} the {{technicians}} at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> were from the SED. While there, he met many of the greats of physics including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending courses on physics taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well-acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic bombs that was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> on July 17, 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy enriched uranium gun design, and almost all of the research at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory was re-oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{returned}} to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> in 1949, {{and worked on}} the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964. He {{also served as a}} Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961, and was the Scientific Adviser to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) from 1961 to 1964. He was director of the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory from 1970 to 1979, when he resigned to become President and Chief Executive Officer of General Atomics. He died at his home in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{served as}} a Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961. He was the first state senator to be elected from <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> County. Senators served unpaid, {{receiving}} only a per diem allowance of five dollars. Since the New Mexico legislature convened for only 30 days in even numbered years and 60 days in odd numbered years, {{he was able to}} continue working at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> taking leave without pay to attend. He attempted to reform New Mexico's liquor laws, which specified a minimum mark-up. He was unsuccessful in 1957, but the law was reformed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Bethe, H. A. , <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> National Laboratory (LANL), United States Department of Energy (through {{predecessor}} agency the Atomic Energy Commission), (October 1972).|$|E
5|$|Bomb {{engineering}} {{was carried}} out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests. By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia. As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos.</b> To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began to taper off, and production models started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity {{to use some of}} the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos</b> laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at <b>Los</b> <b>Alamos,</b> which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E
