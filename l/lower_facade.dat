500|$|One South Broad is a 28-story [...] {{art deco}} office tower on south Broad Street in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by {{architect}} John Torrey Windrim, the skyscraper contains [...] of space. One South Broad originally had an ornate <b>lower</b> <b>facade</b> {{with a lot}} of detail and fluting that was removed in the 1950s renovation. Philadelphia National Bank's renovations included the addition of granite black slabs on the street level facade. These were removed in the 2000 renovation and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the skyscraper's original architecture. The 2000 renovation also created a new entrance on the building's Broad Street front, which leads to a three-story gallery lobby. The lobby was expanded by demolishing a wall and connecting it to the lobby of the neighboring Widener Building.|$|E
500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The <b>lower</b> <b>façade</b> was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.|$|E

5|$|The {{exemplar of}} Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the <b>lower</b> <b>façades</b> were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|R
2500|$|So {{named after}} the Puuc hills in which this style {{developed}} and flourished during the latter portion of the Late Classic and throughout the Terminal Classic in the northern Maya lowlands, Puuc architecture consists of veneer facing stones applied to a concrete core. [...] Two façades were typically built, partitioned by a ridge of stone. [...] The blank <b>lower</b> <b>façade</b> is formed by flat cut stones and punctuated by doorways. [...] The upper partition is richly decorated with repeating geometric patterns and iconographic elements, especially the distinctive curved-nosed Chaac masks. [...] Carved columnettes are also common.|$|E

50|$|Despite its {{aesthetic}} functionalism, {{the building}} {{is not a simple}} purpose building; especially the materials have not saved costs or effort.

5000|$|Giorgio Vasari was the architect, {{commissioned}} in 1567 by Grand Duke Cosimo I, for {{the first}} remodeling of the church, which included removing its original rood screen and loft, and adding six chapels between the columns.

50|$|The feed-in tariff, {{in force}} since 1 August 2004, was {{modified}} in 2008.In {{view of the}} unexpectedly high growth rates, the depreciation was accelerated and a new category (>1000 kWp) was created with a <b>lower</b> tariff. The <b>facade</b> premium was abolished. In July 2010, the Renewable Energy Sources Act was again amended to reduce the tariffs by a further 16% {{in addition to the}} normal annual depreciation, as the prices for PV panels had dropped sharply in 2009. The contract duration is 20 years.|$|R
