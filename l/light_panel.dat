2500|$|The Torino model line-up was {{the same}} as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport no longer was {{available}} with the [...] "Sportsroof" [...] fastback roofline, and the new [...] "Gran Torino Elite" [...] was introduced. The Gran Torino Elite was developed by Ford to help respond to Chevrolet's ever popular Monte Carlo. The Elite, was designed as an entry level [...] "personal luxury" [...] vehicle, for those who couldn't afford a Thunderbird, and was in the same price range as the Monte Carlo. The Elite was described by Ford as [...] " [...] A totally new 2-door hardtop[...].with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury[...].plus mid-size economy." [...] The Elite wasn't totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite had unique front sheet metal, with styling that was indeed inspired by the Thunderbird. It had twin headlamps surrounded by chrome bezels and parking lamps on the outer edges of the pointed front fenders. Its grille was large and rectangular arching across the front. The quarter panels and doors were shared with the Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar and did not have the sweeping body line like other Torinos. The tail <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> also featured larger tail lights that ran the full width of the car; the centre portion being non-functional. The Elite came standard with a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof, opera windows, split bench seat, [...] "Westminster" [...] cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

It was introduced in 1961 as a successor to the station wagon and pick-up versions of the Škoda 1201 and closely resembled the slightly smaller Octavia Combi.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} system in all {{six years of}} the XL175 was a six volt system and included a battery, headlight with high/low beam, turn signals, brake/taillight, instrumentation lights, and a horn. A warning <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> was also included on models 1976 through 1978 which displayed lights for 'High Beam' (blue light), 'Turn Signal' (orange light) and 'Neutral' (green light). Models from 1973 through 1975 incorporated warning lights for neutral and turn signals into the tachometer face, and a high beam indicator light {{on the top of}} the headlight housing.|$|E

40|$|Prototype <b>lighting</b> <b>panels</b> and luminaires were {{fabricated}} using DuPont Displaysâ solution-processed small-molecule OLED technology. These <b>lighting</b> <b>panels</b> {{were based}} on a spatially-patterned, 3 -color design, similar in concept to an OLED display panel, with materials chosen to maximize device efficacy. The majority of the processing steps take place in air (rather than high vacuum). Optimization of device architecture, processing and construction was undertaken, with a final prototype design of 50 cm{sup 2 } being fabricated and tested. Performance of these panels reached 35 lm/W at illuminant-A. A unique feature of this technology is the ability to color tune the emission, and color temperatures ranging from 2700 to > 6, 500 K were attained in the final build. Significant attention was paid to low-cost fabrication techniques...|$|R
50|$|Another {{modification}} {{made to the}} PDP-10 by CompuServe engineers was {{the replacement}} of the hundreds of incandescent indicator lamps on the KI10 processor cabinet with LED lamp modules. The cost of the conversion was easily offset by the cost savings in electric consumption, the reduction of heat, and the manpower required to replace burned-out lamps. Digital followed this step all over the world. The picture on the right hand side shows the <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> of the MF10 memory which is contemporaneous with the KI10 CPU. This item is part of a computer museum, and was populated with LEDs in 2008 for demonstration purposes only. There were no similar banks of indicator lamps on KL and KS processors.|$|E
50|$|The NCR 315-100 was {{the second}} version of the {{original}} 315. It too had a 6 microsecond clock cycle, and from 10,000 to 40,000 slabs of memory. The 315-100 series console I/O incorporated a Teletype printer and keyboard {{in place of the}} original 315's IBM typewriter. The primary difference between the older NCR 315 and the 315-100 was the inclusion of the Automatic Recovery Option (ARO). One of the problems with early generation of computers was that when a memory or program error occurred, the system would literally turn on a red light and halt. The normal recovery process was to copy all register and counter setting from the console <b>light</b> <b>panel,</b> and to restart the program that was running {{at the time of the}} error. Usually the restart was from the very beginning of the program.|$|E
5000|$|Season 2 - 1968 Dodge Dart GTS 340 {{convertible}} [...] "kustomized" [...] by George Barris with functional hood scoops, Lucas Flamethrower driving lights, blacked-out grille, racing-style gas filler cap, molded-in rear spoiler, {{blacked out}} tail <b>light</b> <b>panel,</b> and custom tail light lenses. The car was originally red, but Executive Producer Bruce Geller wanted it {{changed to a}} British Racing Green, which Barris did. (This car still retains its original red paint under the carpet.) A Motorola car-phone (a remarkably expensive and rare item in 1968) was installed. Rader mag wheels like those on the Batmobile were originally installed by Barris, but changed later in the 1968 season to Cragar S/S chrome wheels. George Barris also installed his own [...] "Barris Kustoms" [...] emblem on {{the lower part of}} each front fender. No duplicate 1968 Mannix Darts were built; it is a [...] "1 of 1" [...] car. This car was used in both the 1968 and 1969 seasons of Mannix.|$|E

5000|$|In Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman can wield {{a single}} Batarang from the beginning, and the player has the {{opportunity}} to unlock multiple as well as remote-controlled Batarangs and Sonic Batarangs, which can be used to attract enemies. In addition, the Collector's Edition of the game comes with a 14" [...] plastic Batarang model (scuffed and scratched to suggest heavy usage) affixed to a display base. The Batarang appears in the sequel, Batman: Arkham City along with the remote-controlled Batarangs and a new type, a reverse Batarang able to loop behind an enemy and attack from behind. Batman: Arkham Knight, the third and final installment in Rocksteady's Arkham trilogy, also features the batarang with many of the same variants and abilities seen in the previous two games. Batman also has a new Batarang called the Bat Scanner he can throw high into the air around Gotham to scan a specific area and is used several times during Batman's hunt for Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight. Interestingly though the Bat Scanner resembles a remote control Batarang, it can fly much farther into the air, though unlike most gadgets it only appears during cutscenes. Toy and prop replica company NECA produced a batarang replica based in the Arkham Knight design, which can be purchased through video game retailer Gamestop. This batarang replica can be folded at its middle hinge and rapidly opened with the press of a button, and also has a removable LED <b>light</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
