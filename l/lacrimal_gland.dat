25|$|The preorbital gland is a paired {{exocrine gland}} {{found in many}} species of hoofed animals, which is {{homologous}} to the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined {{by a combination of}} sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{supply of}} {{parasympathetic}} nerves {{to the face}} and the upper jaw (maxilla) derives from the greater superficial petrosal (GSP) branch of cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve. The GSP nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve (of the sympathetic nervous system), derived from the carotid plexus, to form the vidian nerve (in the vidian canal) that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion (an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve), wherein only the parasympathetic nerves form synapses, which serve the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> and the glands of the nose and of the palate, via the (upper jaw) maxillary division of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the synthesis and cellular distribution of group II phospholipase A 2 and lysozyme in the main and accessory <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> Methods. The authors studied samples of normal main <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of seven autopsied subjects and accessory <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of eight patients who underwent ptosis surgery. The specimens were immunostained with a rabbit antiserum against group II phospholipase A 2 and a monoclonal antibody against lysozyme. Expression of group II phospholipase A 2 gene was shown using Northern hybridization and in situ hybridization. Results. Lysozyme was present in the secretory granules of most acini, whereas group II phospholipase A 2 was seen in a minority of acinar cells, primarily in the central parts of lobules in the main and accessory <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> Synthesis of group II phospholipase A 2 in the glandular cells was confirmed by Northern hybridization and by in situ hybridization. Conclusions. There are two specialized cell types in the main and accessory <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands,</b> one synthesizing group II phospholipase A 2 and the other synthesizing lysozyme. These enzymes are important nonspecific antibacterial factors in tears. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1996; 37 : 1826 - 1832...|$|R

500|$|A {{disorder}} {{commonly found}} in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as [...] "dry eye". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or heal over time.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{specific}} synkinesis, crocodile tears syndrome (hyperlacrimation upon eating), {{has been shown}} to respond exceedingly well to Botox injection. Botox is injected directly into the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> and has shown to reduce hyperlacrimation within 24–48 hours. The procedure was shown to be simple and safe with very little chance of side-effects (although on rare occasions ptosis can occur due to botulinum toxin diffusion). Furthermore, reduction in hyper-lacrimation was shown to last longer than the expected 3 months (about 12 months).|$|E

30|$|The uptake {{shown in}} the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> {{will result in a}} {{significant}} dose from 68 Ga, approximately 1.19 E− 10 [*]Gy/decay (428 [*]mGy/MBq[*]h), given that the organ is spherical with a mass of 0.7 [*]g. Applying this approximation for the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> means that this organ will obtain an absorbed dose of 0.12 [*]mGy per administered megabecquerel. This is less than that for the kidneys, but the second highest organ dose. PSMA uptake in the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> has been observed by others [16, 27 – 29]; however, there is little published data on absorbed dose to the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> found in the literature, possibly partly due to the low cancer frequency in this organ [30] and the assumed low sensitivity to radiation. Furthermore, ICRP do not include the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> in their different reports, not even in the Reference man report (ICRP Publication 89 [31]). A mass as low as 0.7 [*]g for one gland means that the partial volume effect will affect the assessment of the total activity content considerably. To compensate for this, a NEMA phantom was measured on the same scanner to derive a correction factor, and {{it was found that the}} voxel showing the measured activity of the highest voxel should be multiplied by a factor of 2 to obtain the true activity concentration in the gland.|$|R

40|$|Sjögren’s {{syndrome}} (SS) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease characterized by severe inflammation of exocrine glands {{such as the}} salivary and <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> When it affects the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands,</b> many patients experience keratoconjunctivitis due to severely dry eyes. This study investigated the pathological and immunological characteristics of ocular lesions in a mouse model of SS. Corneal epithelial injury and hyperplasia were confirmed pathologically. The number of conjunctival mucin-producing goblet cells was significantly decreased in the SS model mice compared with control mice. Expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, interleukin (IL) - 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) 12 were significantly higher in the corneal epithelium of the SS model mice than in control mice. Inflammatory lesions were observed in the Harderian, intraorbital, and extraorbital <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> in the SS model mice, suggesting that the ocular glands were targeted by an autoimmune response. The <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of the SS model mice were infiltrated by cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 + T cells. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed significantly increased mRNA expression of TNF-α, TGF-β, CXCL 9, and lysozyme in the extraorbital <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of the SS model mice compared with control mice.

Immunohistochemical studies showed that VAMP 8 is expressed in all examined exocrine tissues such as salivary <b>glands,</b> <b>lacrimal</b> (tear) <b>glands,</b> sweat glands, sebaceous glands, mammary glands, and the prostate.

40|$|Abstract. A {{sequential}} {{light and}} electron microscopic {{study of the}} exorbital and Harderian <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> was done on 2. 5 - to 15 -month-old Wistar rats exposed to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Typical coronaviral particles were readily demonstrated in cytoplasmic vesicles of Harderian and exorbital glands examined at 6 days post-inoculation. Lesions were seen in a relatively high percentage of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> in infected animals of all ages, with no obvious age-related variations in the incidence and extent of changes. Lesions frequently persisted for a longer interval post-exposure in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> than in salivary glands. The persistence of lesions commonly seen in Harderian glands was attributed, at least in part, to the cytotoxic effects of porphyrin-containing secretions released during the acute necrotizing stages of the disease. The persistence of lesions in some <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> indicates that they are useful tissues for microscopic examination for the retrospective provisional diagnosis of SDA. Persistent lesions also indicate that normal functions of these glands may be compromised for up to several weeks following outbreaks of SDA.

40|$|Introduction: In Sjögren’s syndrome, {{keratoconjunctivitis sicca}} (dry eye) is {{associated}} with infiltration of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> by leukocytes and consequent losses of tear-fluid production {{and the integrity of}} the ocular surface. We investigated the effect of blockade of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTBR) pathway on lacrimal-gland pathology in the NOD mouse model of Sjögren’s syndrome. Methods: Male NOD mice were treated for up to ten weeks with an antagonist, LTBR-Ig, or control mouse antibody MOPC- 21. Extra-orbital <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for high endothelial venules (HEV), by Affymetrix gene-array analysis and real-time PCR for differential gene expression, and by ELISA for CXCL 13 protein. Leukocytes from <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Tear-fluid secretion-rates were measured and the integrity of the ocular surface was scored using slit-lamp microscopy and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining. The chemokine CXCL 13 was measured by ELISA in sera from Sjögren’s syndrome patients (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 30). Statistical analysis was by the two-tailed, unpaired T-test, or the Mann-Whitney-test for ocular integrity scores. Results: LTBR blockade for eight weeks reduced B-cell accumulation (approximately 5 -fold), eliminated HEV in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands,</b> and reduced the entry rate of lymphocytes into <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> Affymetrix-chip analysis revealed numerous changes in mRNA expression due to LTBR blockade, including reduction of homeostatic chemokine expression. The reduction of CXCL 13, CCL 21, CCL 19 mRNA and the HEV-associated gene GLYCAM- 1 was confirmed by PCR analysis. CXCL 13 protein increased with disease progression in lacrimal-gland homogenates, but after LTBR blockade for 8 weeks, CXCL 13 was reduced approximately 6 -fold to 8. 4 pg/mg (+/- 2. 7) from 51 pg/mg (+/- 5. 3) in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of 16 week old control mice. Mice given LTBR blockade exhibited an approximately two-fold greater tear-fluid secretion than control mice (P = 0. 001), and had a significantly improved ocular surface integrity score (P = 0. 005). The mean CXCL 13 concentration in sera from Sjögren’s patients (n = 27) was 170 pg/ml, compared to 92. 0 pg/ml for sera from (n = 30) healthy controls (P = 0. 01). Conclusions: Blockade of LTBR pathways may have therapeutic potential for treatment of Sjögren’s syndrome. </p...|$|R
