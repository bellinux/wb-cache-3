Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger; he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then—citing numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, [...] "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels."

500|$|During the 1880s, {{sections}} of the American press popularized {{the notion that the}} West had been won and {{there was nothing left to}} conquer in the United States. The time when great scouts like Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close. Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro, were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs <b>like</b> <b>Sitting</b> Bull, Chief Joseph, and Geronimo only in Wild West Shows. In 1890 the United States Census Bureau formally closed the American frontier, ending the system under which land in the Western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers. [...] As a [...] "soldier of fortune", as Richard Harding Davis later called him, Burnham began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier, feeling that the American West was becoming tame and unchallenging. When he heard of the work of Cecil Rhodes and his pioneers in southern Africa, who were working to build a railway across Africa from Cape to Cairo, Burnham sold what little he owned. In 1893 with his wife and young son, he set sail for Durban in South Africa, intending to join Rhodes's pioneers in Matabeleland and Mashonaland.|$|E

[...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

In the home opener against , Smith scored on a 24-yard pass from backup quarterback Danny O'Brien and a five-yard pass from starter Jamarr Robinson. Smith scored two touchdowns of 60and 80yards in Maryland's failed comeback attempt at 21st-ranked West Virginia, 31–17. After the West Virginia game, Sports Illustrated considered Smith a rising prospect for the 2011 NFL Draft and described him as [...] "a true vertical threat who has NFL size and home-run hitting speed." [...] Redshirt freshman Danny O'Brien secured the starting quarterback position after Jamarr Robinson suffered a shoulder injury, and the rookie soon [...] "found great chemistry" [...] with Smith. Against Florida International, Smith made eight receptions for 159yards, including a 68-yard touchdown catch and a 32-yard catch that set up another score. He limped off of the field after his touchdown catch, but later said, [...] "I was fine. I was Jim Brown-ing." [...] The following week, he was limited in practice, but started against Duke and caught a 44-yard reception during a first-half scoring drive. However, the lingering ankle ailment continued to bother Smith, and head coach Ralph Friedgen considered using punt returner Tony Logan for kickoff returns until he fully healed. Smith had four receptions for 55yards in the 31–7 loss to Clemson, but was hindered by his sore ankle which {{kept him out of}} practice. Smith said, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> out [...] I feel like I'm leaving my teammates out to dry. I didn't battle with them all week." [...] After the game, Friedgen said in the future he would sit players who could not practice by the Thursday before a game.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{original}} Saints Row developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design. They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics, and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic. Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system. A central design goal was to [...] "create a world that exists independent of the player" [...] that featured more realistic non-player characters (NPCs) that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, drink coffee, open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support close proximity NPC interaction <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> together or cuddling. As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.|$|E

The lyrics of Hollow Crown focus {{on a number of}} themes, with some songs dealing with everyday life <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> in a car with friends or angst against girls, while some other songs, particularly [...] "Early Grave", [...] "Follow the Water" [...] and [...] "In Elegance", were written about Carter's growing dependence on cannabis and him [...] "struggling against his own instincts and self-destructive obsessions". Two songs featured on Hollow Crown – [...] "Dead March" [...] and [...] "Left with the Last Minute" [...] – feature [...] "call and response-type" [...] lyrics about a stalker and their victim's response to being stalked, respectively. For the lyrics of Daybreaker, Carter and Tom Searle collaborated on writing, focusing on what they believed to be [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes, such as the critique of negative aspects of religion and society. Carter and Searle collaborated again on the lyrics of Lost Forever // Lost Together, and in an attempt not to sound like a [...] "broken record", they no longer only addressed political issues, but also focused on themes that everyone can relate to.|$|E

[...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports.

2500|$|Wreden and Pugh {{announced}} that the remake would be released on Steam on October 17, 2013, and accompanied the announcement with a playable demo. Given the unique nature of the title which is aimed at surprising the player and breaking their expectations, a traditional demo that would showcase {{some parts of the}} actual game would take away from the surprise in the full title. They also found that using a section of the game, taken out of context, left playtesters confused and annoyed with no understanding of that section without including additional monologues. Instead, they opted to create a non-traditional demo, which was developed to give the player the flavor of the game, using the same concepts of misconceptions and non-linear storytelling that were part of the original game. This includes a section modeled after a waiting room, {{which was one of the}} first elements designed for the demo. According to Wreden, [...] "It catalyzed this sense that even very mundane tasks <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> in a waiting room are fun if they're not what you're ‘supposed' to be doing". Wreden had sent personalized versions of the demos to Game Grumps and Adam Sessler of Revision3 for Let's Play versions, each including a few re-recorded lines directed at these players; Wreden considered that based on the higher-than-average viewcounts for these videos that this helped towards marketing of the game. Wreden considered that the demo received similar coverage as the full title, effectively helping to generate media buzz equal to two game titles for the additional two months of work it took to create the specialized demo. IGN's Luke Reilly listed The Stanley Parables as one of the top six demos in video games, citing how the demo is [...] "an entirely standalone exercise designed to prepare [...] for the unique player and narrator relationship that forms the core of The Stanley Parable experience".|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Takiff from The Philadelphia Inquirer {{praised the}} album for being [...] "serious and reflective, at times heavily laden with psychic trauma. You might {{consider}} Like a Prayer to be 's Misfits...or her {{hour in the}} confessional box". Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, described the album as [...] "a collection of pop confections layered with live instrumentation, sophisticated arrangements, deeply felt lyrics, and a stronger, more assured vocal." [...] The review concluded by declaring Like a Prayer [...] "one of the quintessential pop albums of all time. Barry Walters from the San Francisco Examiner, named the album [...] "'s best and most consistent collection yet [...] the album [...] crosses the line between craft and inspiration. From the start, she's had an intuitive grasp of how {{to put on a}} good show. Now she's got the guts to show us what's inside". Senior editor from The Cavalier Daily Chaz Repak, praised Madonna's [...] "improved" [...] songwriting; [...] "her religious faith and her marriage to Sean Penn, are completely well written", however, he ended his review on a more critical note by saying: [...] "Like a Prayer constitutes Madonna's best work to date. But after such work as [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart", that's not saying much." [...] Negative criticism came from [...] Spin magazine. Reviewer Christian Logan wrote: [...] "On Like a Prayer your relationship to Madonna changes from to song to song, and it makes you uncomfortable. It's <b>like</b> <b>sitting</b> on a table with a friend who's telling too much about herself to people she doesn't know". Joe Levy, from the same magazine, was also critical, writing that [...] "there's not a lot of old Madonna, nothing of the generation of women who grew up in her wake: Regina, Debbie Gibson, and Taylor Dayne", but highlighted [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "the only great dance song on the record". At the end of 1989, Like a Prayer was voted the 18th best record {{of the year in the}} Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice.|$|E
