50|$|The <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> (Globicephala melas) {{is a large}} {{species of}} oceanic dolphin. It shares the genus Globicephala with the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus). <b>Long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are known as such because of their unusually long {{pectoral}} fins.|$|R
50|$|Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> can be {{confused}} with their relatives the <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> but there are various differences. As their names indicate, their flippers are shorter {{than those of the}} <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with a gentler curve on the edge. They have fewer teeth than the <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with 14 to 18 on each jaw. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are black or dark grey with a grey or white cape. They have grey or almost white patches on their bellies and throats and a grey or white stripe which goes diagonally upwards from behind each eye.|$|R

40|$|There are {{two species}} of <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> in the Western Atlantic — the Atlantic or <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> Globicephala melas, and the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> G. macrorhynchus. The {{distribution}} of <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> a northern species, overlaps {{with that of the}} short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> a predominantly southern species, between 35 ° 30 'N to 38 ° 00 'N (Leatherwood et al. 1976). Although <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are most likely the species bycaught in the waters north of Delaware Bay, many of the <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> takes are not identified to species and bycatch does occur in the overlap area. In this summary, therefore, <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala melas) and unidentified <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala sp.) are considered together. <b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala sp.) are distributed principally along the continental shelf edge in the winter and early spring off the northeast USA coast, (CETAP 1982; Payne and Heinemann 1993; Abend and Smith 1999). In late spring, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> move onto Georges Bank and into the Gulf of Maine and more northern waters, and remain in these areas through late autumn (CETAP 1982; Payne and Heinemann 1993). In general, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> occupy areas of high relief or submerged banks. They are also associated with the Gulf Stream north wall and thermal fronts along the continental shelf edge (Waring et al. 1992; NMFS unpublished data).

5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> grow more slowly than <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> For the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|R
500|$|The <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> has {{traditionally}} been hunted by [...] "driving", which involves many hunters and boats gathering in a semicircle behind a pod of whales close to shore, and slowly driving them towards a bay, where they become stranded and are then slaughtered. This practice was common in both the 19th and 20th centuries. At the Faroe Islands, <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> hunting started {{at least in the}} 16th century, and continued into the modern times, as thousands were killed during the 1970s and 1980s. In other parts of the North Atlantic, such as Norway, West Greenland, Ireland and Cape Cod, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have also been hunted, but to a lesser extent. Iceland,. One fishery at Cape Cod harvested 2,000–3,000 whales per year during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Newfoundland's <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> fishery was at its highest in 1956, but declined shortly after and is now defunct. In the Southern Hemisphere, exploitation of <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> has been sporadic and low. [...] Currently, <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are only hunted at the Faroe Islands and Greenland.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales.</b> For short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have a 15-month gestation period.|$|R

40|$|Although the {{expected}} {{distribution of the}} <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> in the Atlantic includes the Azores, overlapping with the known northern distribution of the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> the only documental references to the species in the archipelago {{are based on a}} single specimen captured in 1894. Moreover, a clear distinction between the two species of pilot-whales based on osteological grounds was only possible after 1971 and before that a great uncertainty existed about the phylogeny of the Genus. The <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> thus, has never been confirmed by sightings at sea in the region and the extent of its occurrence to the South in the central North Atlantic has been, up to now, an open issue.

5|$|The short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed {{from the}} skeleton that the whale {{had a large}} beak.

5|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to}} the genus Globicephala.

Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> living in colder waters and short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> living in tropical and subtropical waters. <b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale.

500|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>whales</b> emit {{echolocation}} clicks for foraging {{and whistles}} and burst pulses as social signals (e.g. to keep contact {{with members of}} their pod). With active behavior, vocalizations are more complex, while less-active behavior is accompanied by simple vocalizations. Differences {{have been found in}} the calls of the two species. Compared with short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have relatively low-frequency calls with narrow frequency ranges. In one study of North Atlantic <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> certain vocalizations were heard to accompany certain behaviors. When resting or [...] "milling", simple whistles are emitted. Surfacing behavior is accompanied by more complex whistles and pulsed sounds. [...] The number of whistles made increases with the number of subgroups and the distance in which the whales are spread apart.|$|R
500|$|<b>Long-finned</b> and short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are so similar, it is {{difficult}} to tell the two species apart. They were traditionally differentiated by the length of the pectoral flippers relative to total body length and the number of teeth. The <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was thought to have 9–12 teeth in each row and flippers one-fifth of total body length, compared to the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> with its 7–9 teeth in each row and flippers one-sixth of total body length. [...] Studies of whales in the Atlantic showed much overlap in these characteristics between the species, making them clines instead of distinctive features. Thus, biologists have since used skull differences to distinguish the two species. The skull of the short-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> has a shorter and broader rostum with a premaxilla that covers more of the maxilla. By contrast, the <b>long-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale's</b> skull has a more elongated rostum and a more exposed maxilla.|$|R
