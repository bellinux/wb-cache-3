40|$|Aluminum alloys {{are widely}} used in aerospace, automotive, railway and the {{shipbuilding}} industry, as materials with remarkable properties for applications in these fields. For this reason, {{in the recent years}} the interest for friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding</b> of light alloy sheets increased. The behaviour of welding materials, from the plastic and mechanic viewpoint, is different in case of friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding</b> compared to friction stir butt welding. The friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding</b> tools can have different configurations and sizes compared to butt welding. The welding parameters have to be reconsidered, in order to obtain a proper flow of material for stir <b>lap</b> <b>welded</b> joints. In addition, it is very important the preparation of the sheet surfaces that comes into contact and their placement (relative to each other). The paper presents considerations regarding friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding,</b> with examples/concrete results obtained in welding of similar and dissimilar light alloys (alloys of aluminum, magnesium and titanium). It also presents data on the characteristics of obtained welded joints, related with particularities of friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding.</b> The obtained results showed that light alloys sheets used in various industrial fields can be joined respecting certain basic conditions, specific for the friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welding</b> process...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. Friction stir welding {{has been}} shown by {{previous}} investigators to have many advantages over traditional metal joining practices. Friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welds</b> and friction stir spot welds {{have been shown to}} be stronger than rivets when joining materials of the same thickness. Substructures containing continuous <b>lap</b> <b>welded</b> joints have demonstrated increased load carrying capabilities over their riveted counterparts. In full-scale structures, however, continuous welds are not always an option. Welds may be interrupted by fixturing limitations, tooling restrictions, or stiffening members that cross the weld path. In these situations, a discontinuous <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> would be necessary. The principal problem with a discontinuous weld is that the tool plunge and exit locations cannot be eliminated with a run-off tab, as in continuous welded structures. These plunge and exit locations are then subjected to operational loads. In fatigue applications, it has been demonstrated that cracks will initiate in the exit hole of a discontinuous weld. The purpose of this study was to investigate techniques to terminate a <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> without compromising the structure by leaving an unprotected exit hole...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPresshardened {{steel is}} used in {{nowadays}} automotive production. Due to its high strength, sheet thicknesses can be reduced which results in decreasing weight of car body components.

In this paper laser beam welding of 22 MnB 5 with varying energy input per irradiated area is presented. It is found that increasing energy input per seam length reduces tensile strength. Using a small spot size of 200 μm, tensile strength of 1434 N/mm 2 can be reached in bead on plate <b>welds.</b> In <b>lap</b> <b>welds</b> tensile strength is limited because of coating particles agglomerating at the melt pool border line.

In this case, Aluminum material A 1100, with thickness of 0. 4 mm was used. Tool material of HSS material was shaped with micro grinding process.

In this investigation, friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>welded</b> (FSLWed) joints of AZ 31 B-H 24 Mg alloy were characterized {{in terms of the}} welding defects, microstructure, hardness, and fatigue properties at various combinations of tool rotational rates and welding speeds. It was observed that the hardness decreased from the base metal (BM) to the stir zone (SZ) across the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). The lowest value of hardness appeared in the SZ. With increasing tool rotational rate or decreasing welding speed, the average hardness in the SZ decreased owing to increasing grain size, and a Hall-Petch-type relationship was established. Fatigue fracture of the <b>lap</b> <b>welds</b> always occurred at the interface between the SZ and TMAZ on the advancing side where a larger hooking defect was present (in comparison with the retreating side). The welding parameters had a significant influence on the hook height and the subsequent fatigue life.
