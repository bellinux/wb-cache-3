50|$|These exciton eigenstates provide {{valuable}} insight to SBEs and SLEs, especially, when one analyses the linear semiconductor absorption spectrum or photoluminescence at steady-state conditions. One simply uses the constructed eigenstates to diagonalize the homogeneous {{parts of the}} SBEs and SLEs. Under the steady-state conditions, the resulting equations can be solved analytically when one further approximates dephasing due to higher-order many-body effects. When such effects are fully included, one must resort to a numeric approach.

[...] The reduction in intensity of a light wave propagating through a medium by {{absorption of}} a part of its photons is often called attenuation.

50|$|Typically, two-photon {{absorption}} (TPA) {{takes place}} at twice the wavelength as one-photon absorption (OPA). This feature allows for the TPCD based study of chiral systems in the far to near ultraviolet (UV) region. ECD cannot be employed in this region due to interferences from strong <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> of typical buffers and solvents and {{also because of the}} scattering exhibited by inhomogeneous samples in this region.Several other advantages are {{associated with the use of}} non-linear absorption, i.e. high spatial resolution, enhanced penetration depth, improved background discrimination and reduced photodamage to living specimens. In addition, the fact that TPA transitions obey different selection rules than OPA (even-parity vs. odd-parity) leads to think that in chiral molecules ECD and TPCD should present different spectral features, thus making the two methods complementary. TPCD is very sensitive to small structural and conformational distortions of chiral molecules, and therefore, is potentially useful for the fundamental study of optically active molecules. Finally, TPCD has the potential to penetrate into the far-UV region, where important structural/conformational information is typically obscure to ECD. This would enable the discovery of new information about molecular systems of interest such as, peptides, biological macromolecules (allowing for a deeper understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) and potential candidates for negative refractive index (for the developing of cloaking devices).|$|E

5000|$|Two-photon {{absorption}} is a third-order {{with respect}} to the third-order optical susceptibility [...] and a second-order process {{with respect to}} light intensity. For this reason it is a non-linear process several orders of magnitude weaker than <b>linear</b> <b>absorption,</b> thus very high light intensities are required {{to increase the number of}} such rare events. For example, tightly-focused laser beams provide the needed intensities. Here, pulsed laser sources are preferred as they deliver high-intensity pulses while depositing a relatively low average energy. To enable 3D structuring, the light source must be adequately adapted to the photoresist in that single-photon absorption is highly suppressed while two-photon absorption is favoured. This condition is met if and only if the resist is highly transparent for the laser light's output wavelength λ and, simultaneously, absorbing at λ/2. As a result, a given sample relative to the focused laser beam can be scanned while changing the resist's solubility only in a confined volume. The geometry of the latter mainly depends on the iso-intensity surfaces of the focus. Concretely, those regions of the laser beam which exceed a given exposure threshold of the photosensitive medium define the basic building block, the so-called voxel. Other parameters which influence the actual shape of the voxel are the laser mode and the refractive-index mismatch between the resist and the immersion system leading to spherical aberration.|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{mediated}} ablation of collagen gels and porcine cornea was {{studied at}} various laser pulse durations {{in the range}} from 350 fs to 1 ns at 1, 053 nm wavelength. A time resolved stress detection technique was employed to measure transient stress profiles and amplitudes. Optical microscopy was used to characterize ablation craters qualitatively, while a wide band acoustic transducer helped to quantify tissue mechanical response and the ablation threshold. The ablation threshold was measured as a function of laser pulse duration and <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient. For nanosecond pulses the ablation threshold was found to have a strong dependence on the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of the material. As the pulse length decreased into the subpicosecond regime the ablation threshold became insensitive to the <b>linear</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient.

High quality ablation craters with no thermal or mechanical damage to surrounding material were obtained with 350 fs laser pulses.
