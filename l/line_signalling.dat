50|$|R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> {{variants}} {{that support}} R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> in its electrical-pulse form by dedicated two-wire or four-wire circuits usually represent each signal as two different pulse lengths (e.g., 150 milliseconds versus 600 milliseconds), {{where the two}} different meanings of those two different pulse lengths varies by context.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is a {{class of}} {{telecommunications}} <b>signaling</b> protocols. <b>Line</b> <b>signaling</b> is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register <b>signaling</b> occurs, <b>line</b> <b>signaling</b> remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R

50|$|E and M {{signaling}} (E&M) is an out-of-band channel-associated signaling system. The base {{system is}} intended for <b>line</b> <b>signaling,</b> but if decadic pulses are used it can also convey register information.

50|$|R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> is {{a family}} of {{protocols}} that govern the resource acquisition and resource release related to a two-party telephone call attempt and, if successful, {{the establishment of a}} two-party telephone call. Although in the 1960s R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> was represented as electrical pulses on a two-wire or four-wire circuit, by the latter 1970s these analog electrical pulses also could be represented in digital form by a signalling DS0 channel in the trunk, which is normally channel 16 in an E1 trunk.|$|E
50|$|R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> {{variants}} {{that support}} R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> in its digital form via the A, B, C, and D bits in DS0 channel #16 of an E1 {{fall into two}} general categories: those that use only the A bit to represent each signal and those that use multiple A, B, C, and D bits to represent each signal, with using only two, the A bit and the B bit being {{by far the most}} common. Those that use only the A bit, strongly resemble the analog electrical R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling,</b> where each signal is a timed pulse that differs by length of time that the pulse is in the high voltage (i.e., one-valued bit) state before returning to the untimed resting voltage state (i.e., zero-valued bit). Those that use multiple bits to represent each signal usually are stateful in that time of exhibition of that bit pattern typically plays no role in conveying meaning.|$|E

50|$|At {{the media}} layer, VAN is a {{differential}} bus with dominant and recessive states signalling ones and zeros much like CAN bus. The data is encoded using enhanced Manchester which sets it apart from {{almost every other}} <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> protocol. This encodes blocks of 4 bits as 3 non-return-to-zero encoded bits followed by 1 Manchester encoded bit.|$|E
50|$|As of 2012, multiway {{switching}} {{in residential}} and commercial applications is increasingly being implemented with power <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> and wireless signalling techniques. These include the X10 system, available since the 1970s, and newer hybrid wired/wireless systems, such as Insteon and Z-Wave. This is particularly useful when retrofitting multi-way circuits into existing wiring, often avoiding the need to put holes in walls to run new wires.|$|E

Two days of driver familiarisation followed, with passenger operation commencing {{on the morning of}} 28 March 2011. A new control centre has been built on the down side opposite the earlier signal box which has since been demolished.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, a {{consortium}} of several companies started to study Bombardier Transportation's LRC, which was a more conventional approach to high-speed rail, in having separate cars and locomotives, rather than being an articulated train. Pulled by heavy conventional-technology diesel-electric locomotives designed for 201 km/h normal operating speed, inspired by the British InterCity 125, it entered full-scale service in 1981 for Via Rail, linking cities in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor, but at speeds never exceeding the 170 km/h limit mandated by <b>line</b> <b>signalling.</b> It was the world's first active tilting train in commercial service.|$|E
50|$|R2 {{register}} signalling {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the conveyance of addressing information during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase. Although in the 1960s R2 {{register signalling}} was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi-frequency audio tones and by electromechanical devices that could detect those audio tones, by the latter 1970s these electromechanical registers also could be represented by digitized PCM audio in DS0 channels of an E1 other than the R2 <b>line</b> <b>signalling</b> DS0 channel in that E1.|$|E
50|$|In addition, for line {{signaling}} a 2 frequency (2VF) code using compelled sequences of 2400 Hz and 2600 Hz rather than continuous SF tone {{was used to}} seize {{the line at the}} beginning of a call over that trunk and clear it at the end of the call - long after the valuable register had sent 15 or KF and dissociated from the call. This <b>Line</b> <b>signalling</b> element was 2VF to introduce the possibility of more meanings and tone-off idle in order that hundreds of channels in transmission media would not be transmitting standing tones simultaneously.|$|E

Terminating trains from Manchester and beyond use the stub of the former Oldham branch (which has {{been converted into a}} turnback siding) to reverse clear of the main <b>line.</b> <b>Signalling</b> at the station has also been modernised, with colour lights controlled from Castleton replacing the semaphores previously in use (the old signal box at Rochdale had to be demolished in 2011 as it stood in the alignment of the planned Metrolink flyover).|$|E

50|$|The {{prevailing}} tactical orthodoxy at {{the time}} involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single line of battle and then engaging broadside in parallel lines. Before this time the fleets had usually {{been involved in a}} mixed mêlée. One reason {{for the development of the}} line of battle system was to facilitate control of the fleet: if all the ships were in <b>line,</b> <b>signalling</b> in battle became possible. The line also allowed either side to disengage by breaking away in formation; if the attacker chose to continue, their line would be broken as well. This often led to inconclusive battles, or allowed the losing side to minimise its losses; but Nelson wanted a conclusive action.|$|E
