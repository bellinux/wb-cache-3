5|$|The post-war {{years were}} also a period of major bridge {{building}} in the state. The Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1, 1957, the Portage Lake <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge,</b> the largest double-deck <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> was completed in August 1959, and the International Bridge opened across the St. Marys River three years later on October 31, 1962. The State Highway Department started erecting mileposts along the Interstates in 1963, and later expanded the practice to other freeways and used the mileages to number the interchanges along I-94.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, straightened, and deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a vertical <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the vertical <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

US 213 was moved to the new Chesapeake City Bridge, and MD 537B was assigned to the bypassed portion of highway between the canal and county-maintained Hemphill Street, as well as the piece of Lock Street that connected with US 213.|$|E
5|$|The Arthur Kill Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> was renovated in 2006 {{and began}} regular service on April 2, 2007, sixteen {{years after the}} bridge closed. A portion of the North Shore Line was rehabilitated, and the Arlington Yard was expanded. Soon after service {{restarted}} on the line, Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially commemorated the reactivation on April 17, 2007. Along {{the remainder of the}} North Shore Branch, there are still tracks and rail overpasses in some places.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{the last}} of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E

It allows {{traffic on the}} Rue de Crimée to cross the canal and connects the Quai de l'Oise on the north-west side to the Quai de la Marne on the south-east side. When the bridge is raised pedestrian traffic can still continue on a fixed elevated walkway. At {{the time of its}} construction it was the third largest <b>lifting</b> <b>bridge</b> to be built in France. It is now the last one in Paris and is registered as an historical monument.|$|R

5|$|US41 enters Houghton along Townsend Drive on {{the campus}} of MTU. After {{crossing}} the campus, it uses College Avenue into downtown. There, US41 is split along the one-way pairing of Sheldon Avenue for northbound and Montezuma Avenue for southbound traffic.

5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot vertical <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E

5|$|Past this intersection, County Route 507 {{turns away}} from Route 7, {{becoming}} concurrent with Route 17. by heading north on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Bellevill Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a <b>lift</b> <b>bridge,</b> known as the Belleville Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into Belleville, Essex County, where the local street name changes from Belleville Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first section of Route 7 ends at an intersection with Main Street underneath Route 21.|$|E
5|$|State {{maintenance}} resumes {{once again}} as SR 275 crosses the Sacramento River on the Tower Bridge, a four-lane <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> that formerly carried a Sacramento Northern Railroad {{track in the}} center. At {{the east end of}} the bridge, the roadway becomes Capitol Mall, maintained by the city of Sacramento, and crosses over Interstate 5. Seven blocks later, the main road ends at 9th Street; the last block of Capitol Mall to 10th Street, on which the State Capitol fronts, is a two-lane road with a mid-block traffic circle around a fountain.|$|E

In Twin Lakes M-26 passes {{the shores of the}} namesake lakes and Twin Lakes State Park. M-26 passes through wooded, hilly terrain in western Houghton County. The segment of roadway in South Range was recently realigned to smooth out curves in the roadway. From there north, M-26 runs generally downhill on approaching the western business district of Houghton and the Portage Lake <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> from the west.|$|E

5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock {{has been replaced by}} a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|State {{maintenance}} begins {{again on}} the Terminal Island Freeway, which is also signed as State Route 103. After a partial interchange with New Dock Street, only allowing access {{to and from the}} north, SR 47 crosses the Cerritos Channel on the Schuyler Heim Bridge, a <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> opened in 1948. Just beyond the bridge, SR 47 leaves the freeway, which continues northeast as SR 103, onto Henry Ford Avenue, and state maintenance ends. The remainder of what is signed as SR 47, along Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street to the Redondo Beach Freeway (SR 91), is locally maintained. Henry Ford Avenue quickly crosses the Dominguez Channel and Anaheim Street, and merges with Alameda Street, which continues southwest into Wilmington as a local street.|$|E
5|$|Beyond West Brighton near a NYCDEP water {{pollution}} control facility, the line rose onto a reinforced concrete trestle {{known as the}} Port Richmond Viaduct, crossing Bodine Creek and running for about a mile through the Port Richmond neighborhood. West of Nicholas Avenue near Port Richmond High School, the line entered an open cut, crossing under the Bayonne Bridge approach and continued west to the Arlington Yard and station at South Avenue. Rapid transit service continued via a northern spur to Port Ivory; freight service passed the current Howland Hook Marine Terminal (adjacent to Port Ivory) and crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> to Cranford Junction in New Jersey. The right-of-way from the Port Richmond Viaduct to Arlington Yard has remained intact and in good condition, though the former station sites and infrastructure are dilapidated and need rehabilitation or replacement should passenger service be reactivated.|$|E
