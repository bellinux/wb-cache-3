5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle <b>loop</b> <b>design</b> that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} robustness {{of stable}} feedback <b>loops,</b> <b>designed</b> {{on the basis}} of multirate-output controllers (MROCs), is analyzed in this paper. For MROC-based feedback <b>loops,</b> <b>designed</b> in order to achieve LQ optimal regulation, we characterize additive and multiplicative norm-bounded perturbations of the loop transfer function matrix which do not destabilize the closed-loop system. New sufficient conditions for stability robustness, in terms of elementary MROC matrices, are presented. Moreover, guaranteed stability margins for MROC-based LQ optimal regulators are suggested for the first time. These margins are obtained {{on the basis of}} a fundamental spectral factorization equality, called the modified return difference equality, and are expressed directly in terms of elementary cost and system matrices. Sufficient conditions in order to guarantee the suggested stability margins are established. Finally, the connection between the suggested stability margins and the selection of cost weighting matrices is investigated and useful guidelines for choosing proper weighting matrices are presented...|$|R
