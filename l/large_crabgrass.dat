5000|$|The {{prevalent}} {{species of}} Digitaria in North America are <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (D. sanguinalis), sometimes known as hairy crabgrass; and smooth crabgrass (D. ischaemum). These species often become problem weeds in lawns and gardens, growing especially well in thin lawns that are watered lightly, underfertilized, and poorly drained. They are annual plants, and one plant {{is capable of}} producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late {{spring and early summer}} and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses, expanding outward in a circle up to 30 cm in diameter. In the autumn when the plants die, they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the crabgrass seeds to germinate the following season.|$|E

40|$|Biochar, a carbon-rich residue {{similar to}} charcoal, has been {{proposed}} as a soil amendment to improve soil quality and increase crop yields while simultaneously mitigating climate change by the sequestration of carbon. The beneficial effect of biochar on crops may extend to weed species and, although {{it is well known}} that weeds reduce crop yields, there is little published research on the effect of biochar on agricultural weed species. In a series of greenhouse and growth chamber experiments, three questions were addressed. First, how does nitrogen interact with biochar produced from a single feedstock to affect weeds? Second, how do differences in biochar feedstock affect root growth and root system architecture? Finally, how do differences in biochar feedstocks affect weed and crop growth? In the first experiment, three common weed species, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli L. Beauv.), <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis L. Scop.), and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), were grown to maturity under greenhouse conditions using a factorial design with biochar (0 and 2 % of the soil dry weight) and nitrogen (0 and 14 g N m- 2) treatments. Nitrogen increased barnyardgrass and redroot pigweed total dry weight and <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> panicle dry weight. Biochar increased barnyardgrass height by 22 % and total dry weight by 47 % but did not affect root : shoot biomass partitioning. Biochar reduced redroot pigweed height by 30 % but increased branch dry weight by 95 %. Finally, biochar increased <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> shoot dry weight by 34 % but reduced root dry weight 30 % suggesting that biochar allowed <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> to partition more biomass to shoots than roots. In the second experiment, we examined the effects of two types of biochar on <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> root system architecture using a rhizobox mesocosm. Root growth of <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> varied with the type of biochar used; however, biochar did not affect total plant dry weight. The high-nutrient biochar increased above-ground dry weight and the low-nutrient biochar increased below-ground dry weight when compared to plants grown in the unamended soil. When given a choice between unamended and biochar-amended soil, <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> roots grew preferentially in the biochar-amended soil, regardless of biochar type. In the final experiment, we examined the effect of two types of biochar on the growth of two crop and two weed species grown to maturity under greenhouse conditions. Biochar increased the growth of both crop species suggesting that the incorporation of biochar, especially high-nutrient biochar, into temperate agricultural soils may increase crop yields. However, biochar also increased the growth of both weed species, which may complicate current weed management practices. Overall, this research suggests that biochar has the potential to alter root system architecture and to increase the growth of common weed species. Biochar may therefore exacerbate weed problems in agricultural systems. ...|$|E

Herbicides were applied when weeds were 5 to 15 cm in height. Overall weed control was greater when nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron were applied with other herbicides than when it was applied alone. Results indicated that postemergence (POST) application of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron is effective at controlling grasses including barnyardgrass, green foxtail, and giant foxtail. The research also showed that broadleaf weed control was more effective when nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron were applied with other broadleaf herbicides. 	A field {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the differential response of ALS-resistant grain sorghum to POST applications of nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron at three growth stages. Grain sorghum was treated with nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron at the 3 - to 5 -leaf, 7 - to 9 -leaf, or 11 - to 13 -leaf collar stage. Nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron injured grain sorghum when applied at the 3 - to 5 -leaf, and 7 - to 9 -leaf collar stage, however, sorghum yields and plant height were only reduced for the 3 - to 5 -leaf collar stage.

40|$|Digitaria species {{infestation}} {{levels have}} recently increased in South Africa {{due to the}} prevailing misconception amongst producers and herbicide agents that acetanilide herbicides will control all Digitaria spp. equally effective, irrespective of species differences. Since 2008 a relatively unknown Digitaria spp was noticed in maize fields and was positively identified as D. nuda (naked crabgrass). Research on naked crabgrass world-wide is limited; {{it has been reported}} to be of importance in sugarcane in Brazil and is considered as a serious grass weed in West Africa. Growth chamber trials were conducted to elucidate the germination characteristics of naked crabgrass. Germination of fresh naked crabgrass seed was less than 20 %. Pre-treatment of fresh seed, by means of soaking seed for 24 h in distilled water, increased germination to 99 %. Stored seed (1 -yr old) germinated best (100 %) in a 0. 2 M KNO 3 solution. Naked crabgrass germinated best at constant temperature greater than 25 °C and at fluctuating regimens of 30 / 15 °C, with alternating light/dark conditions. Naked crabgrass emerged faster and total seedling emergence was 20 % higher on clay soil. Above-ground biomass was 5. 0 g per plant on clay soil compared to 2. 3 g on sandy soil. Seedling emergence was reduced by 27 % after burial at a depth of 1 cm and only 5 % seeds emerged at a depth of 6 cm. In a replacement series glasshouse trial naked crabgrass was more aggressive with regard to root mass (AI= 0. 3) and <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (D. sanguinalis) with regard to shoot mass (AI= 0. 04). Naked crabgrass was more competitive in a wet soil profile (CR= 1. 88) and <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> in a dry soil profile (CR= 2. 02). Both grass weeds are making similar demands on the available resources (RYT= 1). The competition effect of both naked and <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> was determined in glasshouse trials in two soil types at different watering regimens. A negative linear relationship was recorded between grass density and maize plant height, shoot- and kernel weight. Estimated yield loss of maize varied between 29 and 76 % and was described by the hyperbolic equation of Cousens (1985). <b>Large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> had a higher damage coefficient (4. 1 on sandy soil) compared to naked crabgrass (3. 1 on clay soil). A critical period of weed control was established in field trials for naked crabgrass. The beginning of the critical period of weed control when a 10 % yield loss is estimated varied between the two and six leaf stage of maize, ending at the twelve leaf stage or two weeks after tasseling, indicating a need for season-long control of naked crabgrass. Yield loss of maize in the field trials ranged between 28 and 82 % in the seasonlong weedy control treatments. In field and glasshouse trials the efficacy of naked crabgrass control was evaluated with different herbicides registered on maize. Naked crabgrass is more tolerant to acetochlor and s-metolachlor and started to emerge two weeks after applications. <b>Large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> is still effectively controlled by these herbicides. More than 85 % of naked crabgrass was controlled when PRE applications of acetanilide herbicides were followed by triketone herbicides. Indiscriminate identification of all crabgrass species as “large crabgrass” can cause a shift from <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> to naked crabgrass since the latter is more difficult to control. Extrapolation of characteristics and factors affecting germination and growth between similar species is perilous and should be verified. Results of this study proved that both grass weeds are severe competitors of maize, causing significant yield losses, but species specific characteristics could be distinguished and will improve decision making processes significantly to control naked crabgrass effectively in maize.

40|$|Predicting weed {{emergence}} {{is useful}} for planning weed management programs. Unfortunately, our ability to anticipate initial emergence and subsequent levels of emergence from simple field observations or weather reports is often inadequate to achieve optimal control. Weed emergence models may provide predictive tools that help managers anticipate best management options and times and, thereby, improve weed control. In this study, the germination characteristics of four annual grass weeds (<b>large</b> <b>crabgrass,</b> goosegrass, green foxtail, and yellow foxtail) were investigated under different temperatures and water stresses to calculate base temperatures and base water potentials. These parameters were used to develop a mathematical model describing seedling emergence processes in terms of hydrothermal time. Hydrothermal time describes seed germination in a single equation by considering the interaction of soil water potential and soil temperature. The model, called WeedTurf, predicted emergence with some accuracy, especially for <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (lowest efficiency index [EF] value 0. 95) and green foxtail (lowest EF value 0. 91).

ThompsonThe acetolactate synthase {{inhibitor}} herbicide-resistant {{grain sorghum}} technology introduced {{will allow for}} the application of nicosulfuron for postemergence (POST) grass control, however it is essential to determine a program-based approach to ensure broad spectrum weed control. Field experiments were conducted at three locations across Kansas in 2015 and 2016 to assess a range of possible herbicide programs for grass and broadleaf weed control and crop tolerance using InzenTM Sorghum. The experiments consisted of 1 early pre-plant (EPP), 2 preemergence (PRE), and 3 POST, and 5 PRE followed by POST herbicide treatments. Weed control and crop response were evaluated visually at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after POST treatment (WAPT). Treatments containing nicosulfuron and/or bromoxynil & pyrasulfotole caused 10 to 20 % crop injury at 1 WAPT in both 2015 and 2016 at the three locations. Treatments containing nicosulfuron + dicamba caused up to 30 % injury with more injury in 2015 than in 2016. In 2015 at Manhattan the nicosulfuron-only treatment provided 64 % control of Palmer amaranth and, when tank mixed with dicamba or bromoxynil & pyrasulfotole, control ranged from 71 to 76 %. When nicosulfuron POST followed PRE of S-metolachlor & atrazine, Palmer amaranth control was 96 to 100 %. At both locations, nicosulfuron provided 35, 55, and 61 % control of <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass,</b> yellow foxtail, and stinkgrass, respectively. Annual grass control ranged from 85 to 100 % when nicosulfuron followed a PRE S-metolachlor & atrazine. Greenhouse experiments were set up to determine the efficacy of nicosulfuron on four annual grass species at six different rates, two different rates, and the addition of atrazine. The four grass species evaluated were <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass,</b> yellow foxtail, barnyardgrass, and wheat. Nicosulfuron was applied at 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2 times its labeled rate of 35 g ha- 1. A full factorial of rate by height by atrazine was applied for a total of 24 treatments replicated 4 times on each species. Each nicosulfuron rate was applied with and without atrazine at 840 g ha- 1 on 5 to 10 cm tall plants and on 15 to 20 cm tall plants. Visual ratings were taken 1, 2, and 4 weeks after treatment (WAT). Aboveground biomass was harvested 4 WAT, dried and weighed. Treatments containing nicosulfuron from 4. 4 to 70 g ha- 1 all caused similar reduction in biomass compared to the nontreated check. Averaged over the inclusion of atrazine, nicosulfuron applied at 35 and 70 g ha- 1 provided 17 % less control when treating 15 to 20 cm <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> compared to the 5 to 10 cm <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass,</b> respectively.

Four experiments were conducted to determine the herbicidal activity of MSMs (Sinapis alba ?IdaGold? and Brassica juncea ?Pacific Gold?) on weed and vegetable emergence. In Expt. 1, MSMs were applied at 0, 50, 100, 200 or 300 g/m 2 to the bottom of petri dishes and covered with germination mix. Five of the ten reps were sealed with parafilm. In Expt. 2, MSMs were applied on the surface or incorporated with germination mix at 0, 1. 5, 3. 0 or 4. 5 g/pot in the top layer of greenhouse containers. In Expt. 3, MSMs were incorporated with germination mix at 0, 1. 5 or 3. 0 g/pot in the top layer of outdoor containers. In Expt. 4, six types of vegetable seeds (onion Allium cepa ?Texas Grano 1015 Y?, lettuces Lactuca sativa ?Black Seeded Simpson? and ?Buttercrunch?, mustard Brassica juncea ?Green Wave?, kale Brassica oleracea ?Vates Blue Curled?, green Brassica rapa ?Mizuna?) and two types of weeds, <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis) and Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) were sowed in a germination mix incorporated with MSMs at 0, 88, 176 or 265 g/m^ 2 in petri dishes, and unsealed for 1, 3, 5 or 7 days after sowing. Results suggest that ?Pacific Gold? had better suppressive effects on <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> and Palmer amaranth emergence than ?IdaGold? at 100 to 300 g/m^ 2 under all sealing conditions in petri dishes, while less emergence was exhibited under sealed than unsealed conditions at same rates.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJohanna A. DilleChallenges in weed {{management}} include {{occurrence of}} multiple weed {{species in the}} field, variable emergence among weed species, different spatial distribution and weed densities, {{which leads to the}} persistence of weed patches. The overall objective of this research was to understand the interaction of weed emergence, weed density, herbicide choice, and herbicide rate in soybean. Specific objectives were 1) to characterize the seedbank and emergence patterns of shattercane (Sorghum bicolor L.), prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.), and ivyleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea Jacq.) including initial, peak, end, and duration of emergence in response to crop and herbicide treatments in soybean, and 2) to evaluate <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), shattercane, Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) mortality and dry weight reduction in response to herbicide rates across varying weed densities as well as to determine the influence of velvetleaf growth stage and density on herbicide efficacy. In the emergence study of 2006 to 2008, four treatments were nocrop, no-residual herbicide, half-rate of residual herbicide and full-rate of residual herbicide. Reduction in weed emergence was observed over the years in the same species patch. Species emerged in mid-May in both years, coinciding with soybean planting. Extended emergence was observed for shattercane when moisture was low and temperature high, while for prickly sida and ivyleaf morningglory, extended emergence was observed when moisture was high and temperature low. Applying residual herbicide decreased weed emergence. Herbicide choice was the whole plot, herbicide rates were subplots and weed densities were sub-subplots in field experiments conducted in 2006 and 2007. Shattercane was more susceptible to both glyphosate and clethodim than <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass.</b> Increasing <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> density reduced percent mortality with clethodim, while with glyphosate, density did not affect both species mortality. Shattercane dry weight was reduced to 0 g per plot with 0. 1 X labeled rate of clethodim or glyphosate while 0. 5 X of the labeled rate reduced dry weight of <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> to 0 g per plot. For broadleaf weeds, higher percent mortality was observed with glyphosate than with lactofen at high densities. Palmer amaranth was more susceptible than velvetleaf. Velvetleaf response was density dependent, such that increasing density did not increase dry weight. Velvetleaf growth stage was of importance, as stage affected herbicide efficacy, with higher mortality achieved at the two-leaf stage than the four- and six-leaf stages. For glyphosate, 0. 125 X of labeled rate on velvetleaf density of 5 seedlings per pot achieved more than 90 % mortality when applied at the two-leaf stage, but dropped to 60 and 50 % mortality when applied at the four- and six-leaf stage, respectively. The trend was the same for velvetleaf at a density of 30 seedlings per pot, which had 80, 60, and 55 % mortality for the two-, four-, and six-leaf stages, respectively.

In contrast to <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass,</b> naked crabgrass is not easily controlled with acetanilide herbicides. Critical periods of weed control (CPWC) for naked crabgrass in corn was determined in field studies during the 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 growing seasons at two separate localities for an early and late planting date of corn.

Biomass of naked crabgrass was determined as dry weight per square meter quadrant, which yielded 428 g m 22 at Potchefstroom and 594 g m 22 at Wesselsbron. An exponential regression model was used to determine the CPWC expressed as growing degree days after crop emergence, on the basis of an estimated 10 % relative yield loss in corn. The onset and ending, as well as the duration of the CPWC, differed between seasons and localities. At 10 % relative yield loss, the onset of the CPWC ranged between the two-leaf (V 2) and six-leaf (V 6) stages, and the ending between the 12 -leaf (V 12) stage and 2 wk after tasseling (T + 2). The duration of the CPWC ranged between 22 and 80 d for the respective planting dates, years, and localities. Yield losses ranged from 28 to 82 % in the season-long weedy plots. The shifting of planting dates alone did not reduce yield losses since the effect of late infestations of naked crabgrass is significant. Naked crabgrass control from crop emergence is essential, followed by POST herbicide application during the critical period of weed control to lower the risk of corn yield losses.

Adsorption increased for both compounds as soil pH decreased, resulting in decreased mobility {{and efficacy}}. Adsorption was greatest in soils with the highest clay and organic matter content. Imazethapyr was the least mobile, most highly adsorbed, and efficacious of the two herbicides, although it has the highest water solubility. ^ Soil persistence was also compared as a function of use rate and application timing in a no-till sorghum-soybean - winter wheat rotation utilizing greenhouse and field bioassays with winter wheat. The greenhouse bioassay demonstrated that residual concentrations increased with application date and use rate. Early preplant applications had the lowest detectable concentrations remaining, followed by the preemergence and postemergence applications, respectively. Although injury was apparent with the greenhouse bioassay, the effect was minimal in the field bioassay. This variation in response is largely due to differences in soil moisture conditions which affects availability of these herbicides. There appears to be no difference in the selectivity of winter wheat to the two herbicides. Results also indicate that there may be an interaction between the imidazolinones and leaf rust organisms, with wheat injury increasing {{in the presence of the}} disease. ^ The final objective of this research was to compare the efficacy and soil persistence of early preplant applications of imazaquin, chlorimuron, and FMC- 57020 in a no-till soybean - winter wheat rotation. The most effective weed control was obtained when early preplant applications were followed by sequential preemergence applications of metolachlor or postemergence applications of bentazon. Imazaquin failed to provide adequate control of horseweed and <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass.</b> FMC- 57020 was weak on pigweed species, and horseweed. Chlorimuron failed to control <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> and was somewhat weak on velvetleaf. All three herbicides provided excellent control of triazine-resistant kochia. FMC- 57020 caused substantial injury to winter wheat. Winter wheat injury appeared to be the least in treatments which had the poorest soybean weed control, suggesting the plant density may have an effect on the carryover potential of FMC- 57020. ...|$|E

Selected weed densities of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 plants m– 1 were established within a 15 cm band on either side of crop row for each weed species and the mixture of the three weed species. The effects of weed emergence time relative to pepper were studied by investigating the different yield responses to weeds emerging right after and two weeks after transplanting of pepper. ^ Both weed density and emergence time affected the magnitude of yield loss. The relationship of pepper yield or biomass with weed density and emergence time in single and mixed species interference was adequately described by the single and expanded version of hyperbolic nonlinear equations for each year. Variation in environmental conditions caused variation in competitiveness of weeds, which in turn caused variation in parameter estimates between years. The empirical nature of these models determined their inability to explain the variation of parameter estimates between years. <b>Large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> was the most competitive species in 1998 while in 1999 redroot pigweed exhibited the strongest competitive ability. Hairy galinsoga was the least competitive species in both years. Economic threshold was calculated based on parameter estimates for each weed species, which was lower for weed species with stronger competitive ability. ^ One important contribution of this study is relating to model development. Expansion of the existing model was proposed to accommodate multiple weed species interference. Introduction of one parameter into the existing models to account for the change of maximum yield loss with relative emergence time of weeds could improve the fit of data in both single and multiple weed species study. The performance of two types of the currently most used models was also evaluated. The relative leaf area model did not show obvious superiority in this study. The results of this study are important to weed management of pepper. ...|$|E

Corn uptake of nitrogen (N) is dependent upon many factors including weed species and density and the rate and formulation of applied N fertilizer. Understanding interactions among corn, applied N, and weeds is important in developing management strategies. Field studies were conducted in North Carolina to compare corn and weed responses to urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), sulfur-coated urea (SCU), and composted poultry litter (CPL) when a mixture of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S.

Tembotrione and topramezone have more activity on these grasses than mesotrione. Tembotrione was also tank-mixed with either nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron to evaluate fall panicum response. Activity on fall panicum was similar weather nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron was applied alone or with tembotrione. In the field, it was also determined that nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron could be added to tembotrione to control fall panicum.

However, almost nothing is known about how this root-associated fungus proliferates and grows through the soil matrix. Such information is critical to evaluate the possibility of non-target effects, such as unintended spread to weedy plants growing near a colonized switchgrass plant in a field environment. A microcosm experiment was conducted to study movement of vegetative mycelia of S. vermifera between intentionally inoculated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and nearby weeds. We constructed size-exclusion microcosms to test three different common weeds, <b>large</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), Texas panicum (Panicum texanum L.), and Broadleaf signalgrass (Brachiaria platyphylla L.), all species that typically co-occur in Southern Oklahoma and potentially compete with switchgrass. We report that such colonization of non-target plants by S. vermifera can indeed occur, seemingly via co-mingled root systems. As a consequence of colonization, significant enhancement of growth was noted in signalgrass, while a mild increase (albeit not significant) was evident in crabgrass. Migration of the fungus seems unlikely in root-free bulk soil, as we failed to see transmission when the roots were kept separate.

The model {{was used to evaluate}} the economic returns of four different glyphosate-based strategies for weed control. In the absence of herbicide application (T 1), the soil seed bank increases to an equilibrium density of 12, 079 seeds m- 2 in three years. A single herbicide application during {{the early stages of the}} crop (T 2), which was intended to be highly effective in the control of an early weed cohort, allows a late, unaffected cohort to produce sufficient seeds to maintain population densities in the soil seed bank. A single, delayed herbicide application (T 3), which was intended to control both early and late cohorts, results in a soil seed bank increase up to an equilibrium density similar to that achieved without treatment. Two sequential herbicide applications per year (T 4), targeting the two cohorts, leads to a soil seed bank density after 10 years of 107 seeds m- 2. Model predictions indicate that in the absence of control measures, a 93 % reduction in soybean yield was predicted due to weed interference. The lowest reduction in crop yield (27 %) was predicted using strategy T 4, which is the most common control measure used by local farmers. This strategy clearly outperforms the other options tested, leading to lower D. sanguinalis seed bank densities and higher soybean yields and economic returns compared to those obtained using the alternative strategies.

Weed dry matter was not affected by planting pattern of P. Mehak 1; however, for PR 115, weed dry matter was greater in rice grown in uniform rows (244 g m - 2) than in paired rows (183 g m - 2). Planting patterns did not affect weed-free crop growth and yield, but weeds tended to be more abundant in the uniform planting system, particularly under cultivar PR 115. Consequently, this cultivar grew and yielded better under the paired rows when weeds were present. The cultivar PR 115 had greater yield potential than P. Mehak 1, but growth and productivity of P.

The results imply that yield of some aerobic rice cultivars may be improved by exploring competitiveness of rice cultivars through paired row planting patterns. There is a need to study plasticity changes for cultivars which respond with more competiveness in paired rows. The identified traits could be useful as selection criteria for screening weed-competitive cultivars in paired row pattern...|$|E

Seedling emergence of velvetleaf and johnsongrass were modeled using three different approaches: (1) thermal time calculated assuming 5 C as base temperature for both species; (2) thermal time using the specific estimated base temperatures; and (3) hydrothermal time using the specific, estimated base temperatures and water potentials. All the species had base temperatures greater than 10 C, with the exception of velvetleaf (3. 9 to 4. 4 C) and common lambsquarters (2. 0 to 2. 6 C).
