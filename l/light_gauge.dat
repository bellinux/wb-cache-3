5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E

2500|$|The Triplane also {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for structural weakness because the wings of some aircraft collapsed in steep dives. This defect was attributed {{to the use of}} <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> bracing wires in the 46 aircraft built by subcontractor Clayton & Shuttleworth. [...] Several pilots of No. 10 Naval Squadron used cables or additional wires to strengthen their Triplanes. In 1918, the RAF issued a technical order for the installation of a spanwise compression strut between the inboard cabane struts of surviving Triplanes. One aircraft, serial N5912, was fitted with additional mid-bay flying wires on the upper wing while used as a trainer.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{boundary}} kinetic terms in the Randall-Sundrum model with gauge fields in the bulk. We derive the resulting gauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) state wavefunctions and their corresponding masses, as well as the KK gauge field couplings to boundary fermions, and find that they are modified {{in the presence of the}} boundary terms. In particular, for natural choices of the parameters, these fermionic couplings can be substantially suppressed compared to those in the conventional Randall-Sundrum scenario. This results in a significant relaxation of the bound on the <b>lightest</b> <b>gauge</b> KK mass obtained from precision electroweak data; we demonstrate that this bound can be as low as a few hundred GeV. Due to the relationship between the <b>lightest</b> <b>gauge</b> KK state and the electroweak scale in this model, this weakened constraint allows for the electroweak scale to be near a TeV in this minimal extension of the Randall-Sundrum model with bulk gauge fields, as opposed to the conventional scenario.
