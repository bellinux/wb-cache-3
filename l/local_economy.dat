5|$|Although {{important}} to the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth.

This is due to Moncton's central location in the Maritimes: it has the largest catchment area in Atlantic Canada with 1.6 million people living within a three-hour drive of the city. The insurance, information technology, educational, and health care sectors also are major factors in the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> with the city's two hospitals alone employing over five thousand people.|$|E

Can it be shown that particularities in the governance of <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> contribute to the economic success of these entities?

5|$|First {{inhabited}} by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, {{at the same}} time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and it quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agricultural farming and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's cotton crop failed, devastating the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has been on a slow decline since the 1970s.|$|E
