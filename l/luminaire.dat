25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} help {{to reduce}} sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces {{the visibility of}} the lamp and reflector within a <b>luminaire,</b> so the effects of glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires, corresponding to lower <b>luminaire</b> efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|The use of full cutoff {{lighting}} fixtures, {{as much as}} possible, is {{advocated by}} most campaigners for the reduction of light pollution. It is also commonly recommended that lights be spaced appropriately for maximum efficiency, and that number of luminaires being used {{as well as the}} wattage of each <b>luminaire</b> match the needs of the particular application (based on local lighting design standards).|$|E
25|$|Intensity is {{measured}} in lux, lumens and foot-candles. The intensity of a <b>luminaire</b> (lighting instrument or fixture) depends {{on a number of}} factors including its lamp power, the design of the instrument (and its efficiency), optical obstructions such as colour gels or mechanical filters, the distance to the area to be lit and the beam or field angle of the fixture, the colour and material to be lit, and the relative contrasts to other regions of illumination.|$|E

25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} {{can allow}} for lower wattage lamps {{to be used}} in the fixtures, producing the same or sometimes a better effect, due to being more carefully controlled. In every lighting system, some sky glow also results from light reflected from the ground. This reflection can be reduced, however, by being careful to use only the lowest wattage necessary for the lamp, and setting spacing between lights appropriately. Assuring <b>luminaire</b> setback is greater than 90° from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance.|$|E
25|$|Active use of {{automated}} lights {{suggests that}} the <b>luminaire</b> is used to perform tasks which would otherwise require human involvement, or be simply impossible with conventional fixtures. For instance, a number of moving heads producing tightly focused, pure white beams straight down onto the stage will produce a fantastic effect reminiscent of searchlights from a helicopter (especially if a smoke machine or hazer is {{used to make the}} beams visible). To recreate such an effect without intelligent lights would require at least one human operator seated directly above the stage with a followspot, which would generally be considered to be too expensive for such a small effect.|$|E
25|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} <b>luminaire,</b> and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two experiments {{concerning the}} effects of variations in lighting quality on office worker performance, health, and well-being. Experi-ment 1 had four experimental conditions: a regular array of fully direct recessed parabolic luminaires; direct/indirect <b>luminaires</b> with no control; direct/indirect <b>luminaires</b> with a switchable desk lamp; and, workstation-specific direct/indirect <b>luminaires</b> with control over the direct portion. Experiment 2 contrasted two conditions with no individual lighting control: a regular array of recessed prismatic lensed <b>luminaires,</b> and suspended direct/indirect <b>luminaires.</b> Particip-ants considered the direct/indirect systems to be more comfortable than the direct-only systems, with a further increase in comfort associated with individual control in Experiment 1. There were no simple main effects of lighting quality {{on the performance of}} any task, although the expected changes in performance associated with task visibility, practice, and fatigue were found. Interactions between lighting quality and time suggested that having a degree of individual control of lighting tended to maintain motivation and vigilance over the day. 1...|$|R
25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every <b>luminaire</b> marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution {{has also been}} called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff, compared here) have to be closer together to meet the same light level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by the IESNA. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different <b>luminaire</b> designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by {{reducing the number of}} luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.|$|E

2500|$|An {{automated}} light, properly {{called a}} <b>luminaire,</b> fixture (or sometimes moving head), is a versatile and multi-function instrument designed to replace multiple conventional, non-moving lights. Depending on the venue and application, automated luminaires {{can be a}} versatile and economical addition to a stock of traditional lights because, with proper programming, they can swiftly alter many aspects of their optics, changing the “personality” of the light very quickly. [...] Lighting is typically pre-programmed and played back using only simple commands, although moving heads can be controlled “live” if the operator is sufficiently experienced.|$|E
2500|$|Moving mirrors are {{faster than}} moving head fixtures. However moving heads are {{visually}} {{more interesting and}} have a far larger range of movement. The movement from mirror lights tends to be rectilinear, because the center of movement for both axes is usually in the same place, while one axis of a moving head <b>luminaire</b> describes a circle (usually called [...] "pan") and the other (the [...] "tilt") changes {{the diameter of the}} circular movement. In early luminaires a pseudo rotating gobo effect could be achieved by moving the tilt in line with the other axis and then moving the pan from end stop to end stop.|$|E
