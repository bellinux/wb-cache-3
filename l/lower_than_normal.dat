5|$|In early July, shower {{activity}} {{increased in}} association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> for a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed.|$|E

His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> and processing it through a subharmonic generator.

5|$|During late August {{and early}} September1986, the Western Pacific monsoon trough became {{displaced}} to the east. <b>Lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> pressures favored {{the building of}} convection over the trough. By the evening of September9, a pronounced area of disturbed weather developed southwest of the Truk Atoll. Aided by low wind shear, the disturbance developed slowly, even though the Hurricane Hunters initially failed to find a well-defined center. The disturbance drifted towards the northwest, and early on September12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Based on ship reports, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 06:00UTC on September13. Both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Abby at 00:00UTC on September14.|$|E

5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> blood clotting factor {{that can lead}} to heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

3000|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  1, for the PMSGs whose {{simulated}} DC link voltages are higher <b>than</b> the <b>normal</b> value, the calculated DC link voltages are very close to the simulated ones. This effectively divides most of the above PMSGs into Group 1 or Group 2 based on the proposed calculation method, instead of the detailed WPP’s simulation results, even though there is one PMSG, i.e., PMSG_ 22, which has been wrongly divided into Group 3. As for the PMSGs whose simulated DC link voltages are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the <b>normal</b> value, the calculated results are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the simulated ones. This is because the value of i_d^ref is always set as √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2), instead of the minimum value between the current command of the PI controller for DC link voltage regulation and √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2). However, these errors will not make the mistake of dividing the above PMSGs into the wrong group because both the calculated and simulated DC link voltages are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the <b>normal</b> value. Based on the grouping principle, the PMSGs should be divided into Group 3 if the DC link voltage at the fault clearing time is <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the <b>normal</b> value.|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{determine}} if the viscoelastic properties of Achilles tendon assessed by real-time sharewave elastography (SWE) are modified in tendinopathy and provide informations for subsequent applications of this technique. Method and materialsTwenty-six abnormal tendons (16 unilateral and 5 bilateral tendinopathy) from 21 patients with Achilles tendinopathy and 176 normal tendons (from 16 patients and 80 healthy volunteers) were prospectively included and compared. Mean sharewave velocity (Vmean) was measured on axial and sagittal SWE images at two degrees of passive ankle flexion (position 1 : complete plantar flexion? and position 2 : 0 degree flexion). Tendon maximum anteroposterior and lateral diameters, cross sectional area {{and the presence of}} tears were also noted. ResultsIn position 1, the abnormal tendons Vmean was significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> for contralateral <b>normal</b> tendons on sagittal (Δ= 1. 23 m/s, P= 0. 004) and axial elastograms (Δ= 0. 68  m/s, P= 0. 03) ? and significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> for <b>normal</b> tendons only on axial images (Δ= 0. 49  m/s, P= 0. 01). In position 2 and on axial elastograms, the abnormal tendons Vmean was 1. 14  m/s <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> for contralateral <b>normal</b> tendons however without reaching statistical significance (P= 0. 07). In position 2, the abnormal tendons Vmean was significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> for <b>normal</b> tendons on sagittal (Δ= 1. 26  m/s, P< 0. 001) and axial elastograms (Δ= 0. 52  m/s, P= 0. 05). In tendon with complete tears Vmean was significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> for <b>normal</b> tendons on both sagittal and axial images and in both positions (P< 0. 001). All tears (n= 4) appeared as signal void areas. ConclusionAbnormal Achilles tendons have lower Vmean and are therefore softer <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> tendons. There is no SWE signal into tendon tears. Tendon softening, assessed by realtime SWE, is a new helpful tool in the evaluation of Achilles tendinopathy. SWE may also provide quantitative parameters to assess the severity of tendinopathy to monitor the effect of therapeutics...|$|R
5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation {{leads to}} changes in the {{atmospheric}} circulation patterns (also known as teleconnections). Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, the impacts of the changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil). During El Niño events, precipitation is more higher than normal while during La Niña events, precipitation is <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> in the Pampas. In general, El Niño tends to increase precipitation during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. The impacts of La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where precipitation is lower. In Northwest Argentina, El Niño events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase precipitation in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring precipitation tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during El Niño events. Summer precipitation exhibits an opposite pattern where La Niña years involve wetter summers while El Niño years featuring drier summers. On the Andes in central western Argentina, precipitation is higher during El Niño year.|$|E

Davis' campaign touted California's improving test scores, environmental protection, health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Davis' campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted Simon's financial fraud scandal. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent. Davis' campaign was better financed; Davis had over $26 million in campaign reserves more than Simon in August 2002. Davis gained re-election with 47.4% of the vote to Simon's 42.4%. However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> amount of signatures required for a recall.
