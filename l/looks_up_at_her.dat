6000|$|UNDERSHAFT. No: {{the real}} thing. [Cusins and Barbara {{exchange}} glances. Then Cusins {{sits on the}} step and buries {{his face in his}} hands.

60|$|The {{gray eyes}} {{that had so}} often <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with entreating worship, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now, with a last {{struggling}} ray of hope in them, and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze.|$|R

60|$|He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for a moment; then {{kisses her}} hand. She presses his and turns {{away with her}} eyes so wet that she sees Drinkwater, coming in through the arch just then, with a {{prismatic}} halo round him. Even when she sees him clearly, she hardly recognizes him; for he is ludicrously clean and smoothly brushed; and his hair, formerly mud color, is now a lively red.|$|E
6000|$|... (They {{slip through}} the French window, but not quickly enough to have escaped the notice of PAUL, {{returning}} from his midnight stroll. The VICOMTE stands for a moment {{looking up at the}} empty balcony. He laughs softly to himself, and, throwing his cigarette away, passes through the glass door into the house. All is now silent, save for the nightingales and the distant bells. The curtain comes down for a moment to indicate the passage of several hours. It rises again with the sun. LUCREZIA's window opens and she appears on the balcony. She stands a moment with one foot over the threshold of the long window in a listening pose. Then her eyes fall on the better half of a pair of pink pyjamas lying crumpled on the floor, like a body bereft of its soul; with her bare foot she turns it over. A little shudder plucks at her nerves, and she shakes her head as though, by this symbolic act, to shake off something clinging and contaminating. Then she steps out into the full glory of the early sun, stretching out her arms to the radiance. She bows her face into her hands, crying out loud to herself.) LUCREZIA. Oh, why, why, why? (The last of these Why's is caught by the WAITER, who has crept forth in shirt-sleeves and list-slippers, duster in hand, to clean the tables. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> admiringly, passes his tongue over his lips. Then, with a sigh, turns to dust the tables.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The bird then {{bent over}} its questioner, as a stork does over the {{nestling}} newly fed when it <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and then wheeling round, and renewing its warble, concluded it with saying, [...] "As my notes are to thee that understandest them not, {{so are the}} judgments of the Eternal to thine earthly brethren. None ever yet ascended into these heavenly regions that {{did not believe in}} Christ, either after he was crucified or before it. Yet many, who call Christ! Christ! shall at the last day be found less near to him than such as knew him not. What shall the kings of Islam say to your Christian kings, when they see the book of judgment opened, and hear all that is set down in it to their dishonour? In that book shall be read the desolation which Albert will inflict on Bohemia:[26]--in that book, the woes inflicted on Paris by that adulterator of his kingdom's money, who shall die by the hog's teeth:--in that book, the ambition which makes such mad fools of the Scotch and English kings, that they cannot keep within their bounds:--in that book, the luxury of the Spaniard, and the effeminate life of the Bohemian, who neither knows nor cares for any thing worthy:--in that book, the lame wretch of Jerusalem, whose value will be expressed by a unit, and his worthlessness by a million:--in that book, the avarice and cowardice of the warder of the Isle of Fire, in which old Anchises died; and that the record may answer the better to his abundant littleness, the writing shall be in short-hand; and his uncle's and his brother's filthy doings shall be read in that book--they who have made such rottenness of a good old house and two diadems; and there also shall the Portuguese and the Norwegian be known for what they are, and the coiner of Dalmatia, who beheld with such covetous eyes the Venetian ducat. O blessed Hungary, if thou wouldst resolve to endure no longer!--O blessed Navarre, if thou wouldst but keep out the Frenchman with thy mountain walls! May the cries and groans of Nicosia and Famagosta be an earnest of those happier days, proclaiming as they do the vile habits of the beast, who keeps so close {{in the path of the}} herd his brethren." ...|$|E

50|$|One is a 2.1m high Hellenistic sculpture, {{once thought}} to depict Orestes and Electra. It shows a heavily draped adult female on the right, looking down on and {{apparently}} beckoning a partially nude younger male or child, who <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A sub-theme of {{this kind}} of {{contrast}} occurred in Hans Holbein the Younger's [...] "The Miser and his Mistress". There a young woman in luxuriant Renaissance dress stands behind an ugly miser, reaching across him to take coins from the money bags he clutches to his chest, while he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> crying out with a grimace and trying to push away her hand. An updated version by Philip Dawe was published as a print in 1773 under the title of The Scramble, or Old Gripus plunder'd by his Young Wife. Underneath is a verse commentary: ...|$|E
5000|$|It is when Albert is at Else's feet, begging {{her to be}} his wife, {{that she}} can no longer stand the {{differences}} between them. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in her white elegant dress and she runs away. She breaks away and exposes all her stolen goods from her criminal past. Her confession becomes a conduit metaphor for the criminal underworld {{of the city as}} she pleads with him, [...] "Don't go, don't let me go down." [...] She is looking for mercy and redemption. She believes he can save her and this is motivation enough for her to confess.|$|E

50|$|The {{events in}} the flashbacks are shown again from a {{different}} perspective; each time the girl <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father and sees him disappear in a shimmer of light. Back at the wedding, the girl is still looking back, seeing her father's ghost surrounded in light. The girl places the blue flower in her new husband's breast pocket, and the two wed. As they are leaving the church, the video cuts to her father once more, smiling proudly. He disappears for the final time, his daughter now fully grown up. Throughout, the video is intercut with scenes of the band singing {{in a room with}} a large, light-filled backdrop.|$|E
5000|$|Our Lady of Westminster is a late Medieval {{statue of}} the Madonna and child, now to {{be found at the}} {{entrance}} of the Lady Chapel in Westminster Cathedral, London, under the thirteenth Station of the Cross. The image is made of English alabaster, is flat backed, 36 in high and depicts the Virgin Mary enthroned with the Christ child on her right knee. Mary is crowned and holds a sceptre (now broken) in her left hand, the Christ child <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and holds a globe with one hand, whilst with the other he blesses it. The statue {{is one of the greatest}} treasures of the cathedral is the oldest item housed there as the cathedral itself is a 19th-century foundation.|$|E

Turning to page 6., one sees {{a photograph of a}} building described above as [...] "EXCELSIOR PAPER COMPANY" [...] and below as [...] "Insured by Interoceanic Fire Insurance Co." [...] As a blazing inferno collapses the building in the photo, a policeman moves away the onlookers and one of them (Edmund Lowe) takes a few steps aside to find a woman (Ann Sothern), standing on a pile of crates, observing the fire. As he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she says, [...] "I wonder how it started". He responds by providing a bantering discourse on [...] "two hundred and two ways of starting a fire", illustrating it by striking a match on his teeth. He then offers her a cigarette, then invites her for a beer ("nice cold beer is very nice after a hot fire"), then [...] "some food" [...] and, finally, [...] "a little stroll through the park". She refuses all offers ("you seem to think I was born yesterday"), gets into a car and drives away, while the building collapses and a hand is seen putting an [...] "X" [...] across its photo on the ledger page.|$|E

50|$|After {{graduation}} Sutter {{refuses to}} drink with Aimee from her flask. Cassidy informs Sutter {{that she is}} going to California with Marcus. He suggests he might pay a visit to them but Cassidy says it's a bad idea. She hugs him goodbye and tells him he will always be her favorite ex-boyfriend. His boss, Dan (Bob Odenkirk) tells him he has to let go of some staff. He wants to keep Sutter on, because he is great with the clients, but only if he stops turning up drunk. Sutter says he can't promise that and quits. Sutter then drives past Aimee, who is waiting for him by the bus to Philadelphia, leaving her heartbroken. He heads to a bar and explains to the barflies that it was for Aimee's own good. He drives home drunk, totals the mailbox and gets in an argument with his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He says he saw his father and he's just like him. His mother says he isn't like his father at all because he has a kind heart. Sutter reassesses his life and finally completes the personal statement for his college application, even though he knows it's way too late. He confess that his biggest problem is himself. Afraid of failure and getting hurt he has tried to shut out everything and everybody. While living in the now is OK, there's always another now and he will make sure his nows add up to something. He drives to Philadelphia and finds Aimee as she is leaving class. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hopefully. She suppresses a smile when she sees him and gives him a stern look.|$|E
50|$|The gang then don their disguises {{and proceed}} to rob the bank. The robbery is {{successful}} {{in that they}} find a larger amount than expected, $5 million. They steal the cash and successfully {{get out of the}} bank, splitting up according to their plan, except Alec inadvertently knocks over a jar of pennies that he brought into the bank with him as a distraction for the bank manager and security guard. The jar shatters and its contents spill out all over the floor. Realizing he does not have time to recover the jar's contents, Alec leaves it behind. Casey and Sam meet up at a restaurant called The Outlaws, the agreed-upon meeting point. They are joined by Trevor, and the three wait nervously for Alec, who is late. A television news broadcast in the bar states that the police have recovered a very good lead. Stuffed among the jar of pennies that Alec unintentionally left behind at the bank was a Rennie's Landing badge that Trevor was playing with innocently earlier in the film. The badge has Trevor's full name on it. Using this lead, the police issue a broadcast alert for Trevor, who had just used his credit card at the restaurant to pay for their drinks. The bartender calls the police, who surround the bar. Casey is stopped leaving the bar. Sam goes to the ladies' room. Trevor comes outside to join Casey and sees that he is surrounded. He reaches into his back pocket for his keys, but the police (thinking he is reaching for a gun) fire on Trevor and Casey, instantly killing Trevor and mortally wounding Casey. Sam, hearing the commotion, exits the ladies' room using a back window. As she inches around the bar, she sees Trevor dead and Casey laying on the ground. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and realizes she can still escape. When the police ask a dying Casey if anyone else is still inside, he says no, then dies.|$|E
50|$|Kharaj Mukherjee {{listens to}} all of it and {{immediately}} gives instructions to call Raj and her mother {{to the police station}} when Raj s mother does not receive his phone call from the police station and avoid it. Rajs friends are scolded by the police and Kharaj Mukherjee and all their mobile phones confiscated. Soon after Raj and his mother reaches the police station the next day, Raj is terrified when her mother was asked to sit outside and the police start naming the sections of Indian Penal Code under which he will be booked. Raj gives away under fright and pressure and admits that he has done the crime while his mother is shown calling the minister and asking him to help release her son. The minister calls Kharaj Mukherjee and makes a deal with him while Arjun Chakrabarty is beaten ruthlessly and cruelly so that he is pressurized to admit the crime falsely and Raj is released scot-free. Arjun Chakrabarty does not give away under pressure until Kharaj Mukherjee moulds him emotionally and influences him to take the accusition on himself, the money that would have been spent on bailing out a rich spoilt brat can be used for Urmila Mahantas treatment. Arjun Chakrabarty is influenced by his unconditional love for Urmila Mahanta and becomes ready to take the blame on himself. He is sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and INR 5000 as punishment. Riddhi Sen comes to see his old friend and refuses to believe that he can do such a crime. Arjun Chakrabarty tells Riddhi Sen the whole actual story and Riddhi Sen in turn goes and tells Urmila Mahanta the whole truth and also about the unconditional love Arjun Chakrabarty has for her. Urmila Mahanta becomes furious on hearing the whole story and she goes to meet Arjun Chakrabarty to court on the day of his hearing. She sees as Arjun Chakrabarty is frisked away by the police in the police van to the jail. She comes up to Kharaj Mukherjee and gives him a letter where she accuses him of sending an innocent, poor man to jail for a heinous crime that he hasnt committed while the rich spoilt kid goes scot-free. Her late father had taught her to always avenge any wrongdoing or misdeed. As soon as Kharaj Mukherjee <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she throws acid at his face to avenge Arjun Chakrabarty. She is caught and sent to jail for 10 years while Arjun Chakrabarty is freed and Raj is arrested for his crime.|$|E

5000|$|Once Barbara is {{away from}} {{everything}} she contemplates everything {{and in a}} monologue says that she does love Marisela and that she has nothing out there left and that {{she is going to}} reunite with Eustaquia and Melquiades and that her death is her payment to those she made suffer, she lets Cabos Blancos free saying that she is giving him his freedom back as she gave Santos' freedom back and proceeds to drown herself in the marsh. Cabos Blancos returns to Altamira and Marisela sees him and worries that something happened to Barbara and goes to look for her. She finds her sinking in the marsh, she ties a rope around herself and goes in to get Barbara out, as Marisela starts sinking Barbara grabs her and pulls herself and Marisela out. Barbara and Marisela have a long talk and forgive each other for everything. Barbara tells her that she has to go, that she can't stay because she wouldn't be able to watch her and Santos together. She says she wants to preserve this feeling she has and that she has never felt, she finally feels like a mother before a woman. Before leaving on her bongo Santos arrives and watches as her and Marisela say their last goodbyes, Antonio asks him if he isn't going to go say good bye and he responds that he doesn't want to be an obstacle in their last moment like he has always been. Barbara tells Marisela that they won't see each other but that she'll know how she is every morning when she thinks about her and tells her that when one of her children <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with her eyes she'll know she's with her. That night Barbara runs into a missionary who gives her a place to stay because it is raining, the lady realizes that Barbara has a fever and when she asks her name Barbara responds that she can call her Dona and never reveals her real name. 10 years pass and Santos and Marisela have two boys and a little girl on the way, when Maurice asks him if he still thinks of Barbara he responds yes and that that is the only secret he keeps from Marisela, at that moment Marisela arrives in labor pains and she is rushed to the doctor's office. Barbara (now with long gray hair) has been constantly visiting the missionary woman throughout the ten years giving her medicine for the children that live with her and buying the kids candy and toys all the while she claims to not like children, the missionary tells her she [...] "hides" [...] it well. Later Barbara is lying in the hammock. She is very sick and is dying. The next day as Marisela and Santos are admiring their new baby girl they admit that the little girl has Barbara's eyes, that she looks like her, and at that moment Juan Primito arrives yelling that the ravens (los rebullones) have come back to life and that they all have to be careful. That night we see Barbara next to the river, young again and in her all black outfit with Eustaquia and Melquiades behind her who have come to take her far away. She tells them that they are dead and asks if that means that she is dreaming or if it means that she is also dead, Mealquiades responds that only humans die and that legends like herself never die and live in the hearts of everyone. She goes with them in the bongo and as Eustaquia asks with who they go Barbara responds [...] "con dios y con la virgen" [...] (with God and the virgin Mary).|$|E
