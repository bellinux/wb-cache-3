40|$|The article dwells on {{the most}} {{important}} land-marks in the history of machine translation (MT). In the middle of the twentieth century, at the time when discussions about machine translation started, it was thought that after several years every person would have a small device allowing people to communicate in any language. Today the view towards machine translation has become more pragmatic. For example, everyone agrees that machine translation of fiction will never be of satisfactory quality. The article discusses three key methods of machine translation, namely, statistical, rule-based, and logical. For practical purposes, of-ten several methods of machine translation are integrated. In rule-based machine translati{{on the most}} important role is played by dictionaries and sets of rules. The article demonstrates that morphological, syntactic, and semantic ambiguities are the main obstacles for creating a high quality formal machine translation product. Statistical machine translation is based on data from parallel and monolingual corpora. While statistical machine translation is good for capturing the key words of a sentence, the overall quality of a translation remains <b>low.</b> The <b>limited</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> parallel corpora is the main obstacle of statistical machine translation. The article also discusses evaluation criteria for assessing MT quality, which is often very problematic...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS is also the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> SuperDARN observation.|$|R

On-membrane enzymatic signal amplification is used to reduce the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> detection to the sub-femtomol level. To demonstrate this assay, we detected synthetic nucleic acid sequences representative of Trypanosoma mRNA, the causative agent for African sleeping sickness, with relevance in human and animal health in sub-Saharan Africa. The intensity of the chemiluminescent signal was evaluated by using a charge-coupled device as well as a microtiter plate reader.

40|$|Background: Few studies {{comparing}} multiple {{methods for}} DNA extraction from dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper for PCR targeting the Plasmodium genome have been done. Methods: Frequently-used methods for DNA extraction from DBS using Chelex- 100, InstaGene Matrix, QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and TE buffer were compared on a dilution series of a standardized Plasmodium falciparum positive sample. The two DNA extraction methods {{resulting in the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> detection were compared by testing both on 31 P. falciparum positive samples collected under field conditions and stored for 4 years. Results: The Chelex- 100, InstaGene Matrix and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit methods performed similarly, resulting in the detection of 0. 5 to 2 parasites per microliter (p/ml). The same 13 clinical samples (13 / 31; 42 %) were positive using both DNA extraction methods with the <b>lowest</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> detection. Conclusions: Simple and low-cost methods can be sensitive and useful in extracting DNA from DBS. Poor results on stored clinical DBS indicate that further studies {{on the impact of}} storage duration and conditions, and choice of filter paper should be performed...|$|R
