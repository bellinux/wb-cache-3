The air suspension is linked to the braking system via a Variable Load Valve (VLV), which increases air brake pressure when the coach is more heavily loaded to compensate for the additional weight.|$|E

Mechanical traps commonly use a bucket or float to correlate the position of the valve. A few different types of traps include float and thermostatic, and open bucket traps. Open bucket traps rise as condensate rises, this allows for the valve to open. Once the bucket starts to fill with water it begins to close.

This study offers a novel valve control method merging pulse width and amplitude modulation in the same structure. Proposed method uses low voltage AC signal to understand the valve position and uses pulse width modulation for power transfer to coil. DC level leads to controlling the valve and AC signal gives feedback related to core moving. Any amplitude demodulator gives core position as voltage. Control unit makes reconstruction using start and end points to obtain linearization at zero control signal and maximum control signal matched to minimum demodulated amplitude level. Proposed method includes self-learning abilities to keep controlling in hard environmental conditions such as dust, temperature, and corrosion.

40|$|On {{classical}} passenger trains, {{the secondary}} Suspension is commonly ensured by airsprings which are integrated in a pneumatic circuit. In {{addition to the}} pneumatic bellows. the circuit contains various pneumatic components such as tanks, pipes, orifices, <b>levelling</b> <b>valves.</b> etc., {{the purpose of the}} latter being, to maintain a costant height between the carbody and the bogie. These elements can be connected in several ways leading, to many existing suspension topologies. This paper deals with multidisciplinary modelling of a vehicle equipped with such a suspension taking into account both multibody and pneumatic aspects. First, it depicts in more detail the various elements of a pneumatic; suspension. Then, many criteria that influence the suspension morphology are presented: the kind of bogie, the use of an auxiliary tank, the position of this tank relative to the bellows, the kind of levelling system, the use of all additional anti-roll bar, the use of an additional hydraulic damper, etc. The description of the complete pneumatic Circuit implies the use of thermodynamic models which take into account the airflow through the pipes and the valves, the pressure in the bellows, etc, Several pipe models are presented, the choice depending on the length of the pipe: an algebraic model is sufficient for short pipes, while a differential model is needed {{to take into account the}} dynamics of longer pipes. The pneumatic model is then coupled with a SIMPACK multibody model in order to analyse the behaviour of the complete vehicle.

40|$|HCCI {{engines are}} likely {{to become one of the}} future {{alternatives}} to SI engines due to their ability to deliver high efficiency and low NOx emissions. There are, however, problems with the control of the ignition and heat release rate over the entire load and the speed range, which limits the practical application of this technology. In order to investigate the combustion parameters of both SI and HCCI gasoline engines, a widely used and powerful diagnostic tool is the analysis of the in-cylinder pressure time history as derived from in-cylinder pressure transducers. Such information has particular application in HCCI engines for control of TRG <b>levels,</b> <b>valve</b> timing, misfire and knock detection. Unfortunately, although the use of in-cylinder pressure transducers for that purpose has been an invaluable research tool, it is not without problems. In the case of HCCI combustion, the violent rates of heat release make the signal derived from pressure transducers more prone to thermal shock. In addition, in HCCI research, it is often necessary to establish the TRG amount as accurately as possible. However, TRG presence also complicates pegging techniques. Since the pressure transducer signal can be compromised by these calibration issues, it is prudent to try to address these issues when dealing with pressure signals derived during HCCI operation. The present article presents an algorithm aiming to account for these calibration issues surrounding the use of pressure transducers in HCCI research. Results for the TRG amount and initial mixture composition and temperature on a cycle-to-cycle basis are also derived...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{start-up}} process commenced with the Night Lead Operator on the March 22 {{with the initial}} filling of the splitter tower. The level transmitter was designed to indicate the raffinate level within a 5 ft span {{from the bottom of}} the splitter tower to a 9 ft level, i.e., 72% level indication would be 7.6 ft from the bottom, but it was common practice to fill up to an indicated level of 99%, even though the procedural requirement was stated as 50%. The Day Supervisor arrived late for work and did not have a hand-over with the night shift. During the morning meeting on March 23, it was discussed that the heavy raffinate storage tanks were nearly full and, therefore, the second Day Supervisor was told that {{the start-up}} procedure should not continue, but this information was not passed on. The start-up procedure resumed just before 9:30 a.m. under instructions from the other Day Supervisor. Before recommencing the tower refill and circulation process, heavy raffinate was drained {{from the bottom of the}} tower via the <b>level</b> control <b>valve</b> into the heavy storage tank and was then shut off in [...] "manual" [...] mode and not the required [...] "automatic" [...] mode, with a 50% flow rate. The circulation process was restarted just before 10 a.m. and raffinate was once again fed into the tower, even though the level was already too high. Since the <b>level</b> control <b>valve</b> was shut and, therefore, there was no circulation out of the tower, i.e. no heavy raffinate being transferred to the storage tank, the splitter tower inevitably began to fill up. The defective level transmitter continued to show the level at less than 100%, and since the external sight glass was opaque, a visual check to verify the level in the splitter tower was not possible.|$|R
