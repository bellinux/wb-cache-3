5|$|As a {{primarily}} residential area, Žirmūnai hosted only 7.4% of Vilnius' public {{offices in}} 2003. Žirmūnai is {{the location of}} the Personal Identity Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by Vilnius City Migration Service, which is housed in Žirmūnai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange</b> at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.|$|E

50|$|In 1908 Beveridge was {{commissioned}} {{to devise a}} scheme which would combine <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> with a new government-funded unemployment benefit. The <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> Bill was rushed through Parliament and passed in September 1909 and, after months of planning and recruitment of clerks, 62 <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> were opened on 1 February 1910. The number of offices rose to 430 within four years. At the suggestion of the Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, from January 1917 the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> came under the new Ministry of Labour and were renamed Employment Exchanges, so as to more accurately reflect their purpose and function.|$|R
25|$|In 1906, the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 was {{amended to}} include laundries, {{and under the}} <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> Act 1909 <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were set up {{in order to help}} {{unemployed}} people find work, by providing centres where a large number of employers and the unemployed could post jobs and apply for them respectively. By February 1910, eighty-three <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were open, and proved to be invaluable in helping people find employment. In 1913 these <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> were putting around 3000 people into a job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside. In addition, the government encouraged the adoption of Fair Wages contracts by local authorities. In 1908, special regulations were made for electrical safety.|$|R
25|$|Barber {{designed}} this three-storey block comprising {{a house and}} six shops for himself as a commercial enterprise in 1877. William Holroyd was the builder. Businesses and institutions using the premises included the Brighouse Conservative Club, the Brighouse <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange,</b> Zona beer retailer, S. Wilkinson, and Hopkinson's confectioners. When Barber died, the building was sold for £2,525. In 1914 it was demolished, and Artillery Square stood in its place, to be later replaced by Thornton Square.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14December 1952, Christie strangled Ethel in bed. She had last been seen in public two days earlier. Christie invented several stories to explain his wife's {{disappearance}} and to help mitigate the possibility of further inquiries being made. In reply to a letter from relatives in Sheffield, he wrote that Ethel had rheumatism and could not write herself; to one neighbour, he explained that she was visiting her relatives in Sheffield; to another, he {{said that she had}} gone to Birmingham. Christie had resigned from his job on 6December and had been unemployed since then. To support himself, Christie sold Ethel's wedding ring, watch, and furniture. Every week he went to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange</b> to collect his unemployment benefit. On 26 January 1953 he forged his wife's signature and emptied her bank account.|$|E
25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> programme often managed to find people only part-time casual work. The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not enough to live on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a wage-earner, not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National Health Insurance scheme also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E

60|$|So {{much for}} the policy of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> That is a policy {{complete}} in itself. It would be considerable if it stood alone; {{but it does not}} stand alone. As my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced in his Budget speech, the Government propose to associate with the policy of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> a system of Unemployment Insurance.|$|R
60|$|I do not, therefore, {{propose to}} occupy {{the time of the}} House with any {{elaborate}} justification of the merits of the Bill. Those we may discuss at our leisure later. I confine myself only to a few general observations. Two main defects in modern industrial conditions which were emphasised by the Royal Commission were the lack of mobility of labour and lack of information. With both of these defects the National System of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> is calculated to deal. Modern industry has become national. Fresh means of transport knit the country into one, as it was never knit before. Labour alone in its search for markets has not profited; the antiquated, wasteful, and demoralising method of personal application--that is to say, the hawking of labour--persists. <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> will give <b>labour</b> {{for the first time a}} modernised market. <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> in the second place, will increase and will organise the mobility of labour. But let me point out that to increase the mobility of labour is not necessarily to increase the movement of <b>labour.</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> will not increase the movement of labour; they will only render that movement, when it has become necessary, more easy, more smooth, more painless, and less wasteful.|$|R
500|$|Exceptionally {{strong winds}} {{from the storm}} buffeted parts of Northern Ireland, with gusts of [...] and [...] {{measured}} in Ballykelly and Tiree respectively. The winds downed {{tens of thousands of}} trees and more than 1,000 telephone lines across the region. In the Baronscourt Forest in County Tyrone, 30,000 trees were blown down. Countless roads across Northern Ireland were blocked by debris and major rail lines had to suspend service. There was severe damage in the city of Derry where a newly built school was destroyed. Losses in the city alone amounted to £500,000 (US$1.4 million). In Lagan Valley, a brick community hall was destroyed. An estimated 200 homes and two churches in Strabane were damaged. The town's <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> building was severely damaged as well. In a local cemetery, many tombstones were uprooted from concrete foundations and destroyed. A newly built fire station in Clogher collapsed after its roof was blown off. Several people were injured in Belfast after a glass ceiling collapsed in a bus station and a piece of corrugated roofing blew in from a nearby building.|$|E
2500|$|The Bürgermeisteramt {{organized}} a <b>labour</b> <b>exchange</b> {{in the building}} of the municipal school no.8. The first mass deportations through this organization took place in April 1942. The people were convoyed on foot by the police and military to Primorskoe village near Mariupol, and further taken by train to Stalino, where the central [...] "distribution center" [...] for OST-Arbeiters in the South was located.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{thousand}} Malians took to {{the streets}} in the capital to show their support for the junta and reject [...] "foreign interference" [...] as the Economic Community of West African States said it was putting regional troops on standby for any necessary intervention. A violent clash took place at the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange,</b> which was serving as an opposition headquarters; a number of coup opponents were reportedly injured by thrown rocks and then arrested by police. Amnesty International called on the government to investigate the assaults and arrest the perpetrators.|$|E
60|$|We have, therefore, {{decided that}} {{our system of}} <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> shall be {{voluntary}} in its character. For that very reason {{there is a great}} danger, to which I have never shut my eyes, that the highest ranks of labour, skilled workers, members of strong trade unions, would not think it necessary to use the Exchanges, but would use the very excellent apparatus which they have established themselves; that therefore this expensive system of Exchanges which we are calling into being would come to be used only by the poorest of the workers in the labour market, and, consequently, would gradually relapse and fall back into the purely distress machinery and non-economic machinery from which we are labouring to extricate and separate it. It is for that reason, quite apart from the merits of the scheme of unemployment insurance, that the Government are very anxious to associate with their system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> a system of unemployed insurance. If <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> depend for their effective initiation and establishment upon unemployment insurance being associated with them, it is equally true to say that no scheme of unemployment insurance can be worked except in conjunction with some apparatus for finding work and testing willingness to work, like <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> The two systems are complementary; they are man and wife; they mutually support and sustain each other.|$|R

60|$|The central {{principle}} of this Bill is {{the establishment of}} Trade Boards, which will be charged with the duty of fixing a minimum wage. I am very anxious to give these Trade Boards the utmost possible substance and recognition. They will be formed on the {{principle of}} equality of representation for employers and employed, with a skilled official chairman or nucleus. That is the principle I have adopted in the new Arbitration Court recently established. That is the principle which will govern the system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> shortly to be introduced, and other measures which may come to be associated with <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> and I think it is an excellent principle.|$|R
2500|$|Chaim Weizmann, the President of the World Zionist Organization, {{offered the}} British {{government}} full {{cooperation of the}} Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine. Weizmann sought to establish an identifiably Jewish fighting formation (under a Jewish flag) {{under the auspices of}} the British Army. His request for a separate formation was rejected, but the British grudgingly authorized the enlistment of Palestinian volunteers on in the Royal Army Service Corps and in the Pioneer Corps, on condition that an equal number of Jews and Arabs was to be accepted. The Jewish Agency promptly scoured the local <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange</b> offices to recruit enough Arab unemployed as [...] "volunteers" [...] to match the number of Jewish volunteers, and others were recruited from the lower strata of the Arab population offering cash bounties for enlistment. The quality of the recruits was, not surprisingly, abysmally low, with a very high desertion rate particularly among the Arab component, so that at the end most units ended up formed largely by Jews. The volunteers were formed in a RASC muleteers unit and a RASC Port Operating Company, and in the Pioneers Companies 601 to 609 (all but two lost during the Greece Campaign, with the last two returned to Palestine and disbanded there). From 1942, a large number of further Palestinian Arab/Jew mixed units were formed, still with the same mixed ethnic composition and the same quality problems encountered in the Pioneers Companies, including six RASC (Jewish) Transport Units, a Women Auxiliary Territorial Service and a Woman Territorial Air Force Service and several auxiliaries in local units of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Engineers and Royal Army Medical Corps. Nine non-combat infantry companies were also raised as part of the Royal East Kent Regiment ("the Buffs"), to be used as guards for the prisoners-of-war camps in Egypt. On August 1942 the Palestine Regiment was formed, again plagued by the same mixed recruiting and its associated low quality problems (the regiment was derisively called the [...] "Five Piastre Regiments", due to the large number of Arab [...] "volunteers" [...] that had enlisted just for the cash bonus provided by the Jewish Agency).|$|E
60|$|The House {{will see}} the {{connection}} of this to the Labour Exchanges. The machinery of the insurance scheme has been closely studied, and, as at present advised, we should propose to {{follow the example of}} Germany in respect of Insurance Cards or Books, to which stamps will be affixed week by week. When a worker in an insured trade loses his employment, all he will {{have to do is to}} take his card to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange,</b> which, working in conjunction with the Insurance Office, will find him a job or pay him his benefit.|$|E
60|$|The House {{knows that}} the Minority Report advocates a system of {{compulsory}} labour exchanges, that no person shall engage any man {{for less than a}} month except through a <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchange.</b> That is not the proposal we are making. We are making a proposal of voluntary Labour Exchanges. I am quite ready to admit that no system of voluntary Labour Exchanges can deal adequately with the evils and difficulties of casual labour; but there is one conclusive reason against compulsory Labour Exchanges at the present time. To establish a system of compulsory Labour Exchanges in order to eliminate casual labour, and so to divide among a certain proportion of workers all available employment, would be absolutely and totally to cast out at the other end a surplus of unemployed: and to do this before preparations have been made for dealing with that surplus, would be to court an administrative breakdown which could not fail to be attended with the gravest possible disaster. Until poor law reform has made further progress, to establish a compulsory system of Labour Exchanges would only increase and not diminish the miseries with which we are seeking to cope.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to re-examine William Henry Beveridge's (1879  -  1963) early ideas on unemployment. After {{developing}} through three phases ('from the unemployable to the unemployed', 'from the unemployed to unemployment', and 'perfection of the labour market'), Beveridge finally accomplished a coherent package of remedies for unemployment: <b>labour</b> <b>exchanges</b> with National Insurance on the basis of the living wage principle (previously unexplored but evident through his work). These three concepts, perfectly blended, formed his original and unique standpoint. By analysing this development of ideas, we can position Beveridge's doctrine of unemployment more appropriately in the history of economic thought.

6000|$|I ask {{permission}} {{to introduce a}} Bill {{for the establishment of}} a national system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> There is high authority for this proposal. The Majority and Minority representatives of the Poor Law Commission, differing in so much else, are agreed unanimously in its support. [...] "In the forefront of our proposals," [...] says the Majority Report, [...] "we place Labour Exchanges." [...] "This National Labour Exchange," [...] says the Minority Report, [...] "though in itself no adequate remedy, is the foundation of all our proposals. It is, in our view, an indispensable condition of any real reform." [...] The National Conference of Trade Union Delegates, convened by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, of March 19, 1909, resolved unanimously: [...] "That this Conference of Trade Union delegates, representing 1,400,000 members, approves of the establishment of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges</b> on a national basis, under the control of the Board of Trade, provided that the managing board contains at least an equal proportion of employers and representatives of Trade Unions." [...] The Central Unemployed Body for London, by a Resolution in June 1908, declared in favour of a national system of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> Economists as divergent in opinion as Professor Ashley, of Birmingham, and Professor Chapman, of Manchester, have all approved and urged the project publicly in the strongest terms. Several of the principal members of the late Government have, either in evidence before the Poor Law Commission or in public speeches, expressed themselves in favour of <b>Labour</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> and the Report of the delegates of the Labour Party to Germany strongly approves of the system which they found there, namely: [...] "the co-ordination and systematic management of Public Labour Exchanges." ...|$|R
