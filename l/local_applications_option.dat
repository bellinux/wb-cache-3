We say that this process is successful, if a <b>local</b> <b>application</b> is able to authenticate each layer in the remote stack; it is meaningful if, by using this information, the <b>local</b> <b>application</b> can make its own evaluation on the safety of the platform environment where the remote application is running.

3000|$|Since a node with {{adequate}} bandwidth will not borrow bandwidth from others, nor a node lacking in bandwidth can lend its own, {{it is easy}} to understand that the cooperative bandwidth sharing will not occur if the end-to-end traffic patterns of all mobile nodes are same. Therefore, the network traffic in the cooperative bandwidth sharing scenario is supposed to be unbalanced. We define three kinds of traffic patterns: (i) Idle, which means no network traffic is generated by <b>local</b> <b>applications</b> or services; (ii) Max CBR, which means the <b>local</b> <b>application,</b> e.g., streaming application, expects as much as possible bandwidth that {{is no more than a}} maximum constant bit rate (CBR); (iii) Greedy, which means the <b>local</b> <b>application,</b> e.g., file downloading, leeches as much as possible bandwidth and thus generates a bursty traffic. Each type of traffic has a certain portion of nodes to generate. We denote the portions of the nodes that generate the three kinds of traffic as r [...]...|$|R

Bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist 1 -(4 -aminophenyl) - 4 -methyl- 7, 8 -methylenedioxy- 5 H- 2, 3 -benzodiazepine (GYKI) completely blocked XII nerve activity, as well as respiratory-related synaptic drives in neurones within the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), site of rhythm generation in the slice. <b>Local</b> <b>application</b> of GYKI to the preBötC blocked respiratory rhythm. <b>Local</b> <b>application</b> of AMPA to the preBötC increased rhythm frequency and depolarized respiratory-related neurones. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), GYKI completely blocked the inward current induced by <b>local</b> <b>application</b> of AMPA, but not that induced by kainate. <b>Local</b> <b>application</b> of okadaic acid, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of phosphatase 1 and 2 A, to the preBötC increased the frequency of respiratory motor discharge. Intracellular application of microcystin, a membrane-impermeable inhibitor of phosphatase 1 and 2 A, enhanced endogenous inspiratory drive and exogenous AMPA-induced current (in the presence of TTX) in preBötC inspiratory neurones. Both the enhanced inspiratory drive and the increased AMPA-induced current were completely blocked by GYKI. We suggest that AMPA receptor activation and AMPA receptor modulation by phosphorylation are crucial for the rhythm generation within the preBötC...|$|R

A planning approach was needed to minimize costs for transportation and aerial application of the minerals. A transportation network model was developed for a heliport and service landing location facility problem which used mixed-integer linear programming techniques. Cost and production elements were identified along with interactions of significant variables for the operation. An empirical production model estimated application costs. For one type of mineral, five transportation and <b>application</b> <b>options</b> with two types of helicopters, two types of material delivery options and a shared road system were modeled for a simplified field application version (i. e. two application units in the case study).
