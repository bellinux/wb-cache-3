50|$|Originally {{designed}} to be greater than, or equal to, the construction and performance specifics of an inner container, the Performance Oriented Packaging Standards (POPS) of the US Department of Transportation requirement was that the Salvage Drum {{be at least a}} 'Z' (Packing Group III) solids container. Convinced that this was not an acceptable test for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T) became the UN recommended salvage packaging for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an 85 US gallon capacity steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for Packing Group II and be dropped 1.2 meters (4 feet) on its most critical orientation, and not leak. In addition, the drum must successfully pass a 30 kPa <b>Leakproofness</b> Test. Both tests are very severe for an open-head steel container. This testing illustrates the extreme capabilities of the 'T' Salvage Drum when used for the safe recovery of hazardous materials in transportation.|$|E
40|$|Keywords:Cable gland, {{interference}} leakproof, elastic leakproof ring. Abstract. The <b>leakproofness</b> of {{the submarine}} cable gland is {{of very high}} requirement, the traditional leakproof method can hardly meet the requirement more or less. In this paper, by researching the interference leakproof structure, we creatively applied the elastic leakproof ring into the submarine cable gland. Through theoretical model analysis and test, {{it can be concluded}} that the leakproof device is able to work under 3. 5 MPa water pressure. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} assessing the <b>leakproofness</b> of {{the bottom of a}} deep foundation trench, secured by cavity wall, using geophysical methods of electrical resistivity tomography. The study was conducted on a large construction project in Lublin, in a place where there are complicated soil-water conditions: the groundwater level is above the proposed depth of foundation trench, the subsoil is heterogeneous, and there are karsted and weathered carbonate sediments with confined aquifer below the bottom of the trench. A hydraulic fracture occurred {{at the bottom of the}} trench during the engineering works, which caused the water flow into the trench. In order to recognize the soil-water conditions the first stage of geophysical measurements of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was made. The applied methodology allowed to determine the extent of the hydraulic fracture zone within the bottom of foundation trench. In order to assess the <b>leakproofness</b> of Diaphragm Wall the geophysical ERT measurements were repeated (stage 2) A clear reduction in the value of the electrical resistivity of soils in the area of hydraulic fracture was caused by clay injection. The results of ERT measurements are discussed and graphically presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} {{method and}} the instrumentation of detection of <b>leakproofness</b> on underwater pipelines from a pond surface is observed. The appraisal of sensitivity of a correlation method is made. The factors influencing accuracy of localisation of a method are comprehensively researched. It is gained, that having acceptance alternators over a fulcrum of the tubing with accuracy ± 1 m, and using echo sounders for depth gauging {{it is possible}} to ensure localisation of leakage with accuracy not worse ± 0, 5 m. Technical characteristics of the designed instrumentation and effects of its experimental testing services are reconciled...|$|E
40|$|In the {{community}} of the ceramic materials scientists, there is a great interest in the joints of ceramic parts (or ceramic-coated parts), due to their high strength, thermal stability and <b>leakproofness.</b> An example of application of such a technology is in the construction of nuclear components. For high temperature applications, glass-ceramics are used as adhesive. This generates the issue of test methods suitable to assess joint strength. A first case of interest is the hourglass test, originated from the modification of an ASTM standard, with the aim of obtaining failure under a pure shear state in the bondline subjected to torsion. Unfortunately, due to the brittle nature of the materials involved in the joint, if the strength of the adhesive is not enough lower than that of the substrates the failure does not remain confined in the bond and also the substrates break. Thus, the results are of arguable application for design purposes. A second significant case is the ISO test, in which two tiny bars are bonded to form a cross-shaped specimen {{that can be used to}} load the bond either in peel or in shear mode. But, in both conditions the stress distribution is non-uniform and in the latter (similar to a lap joint) also peel stress is applied. Again, application of the results is difficult. The proposed work, by means of detailed analyses of the loading conditions in the specimens and accounting for the brittle nature of the materials, gives an insight on these tests and the interpretation of their result...|$|E
40|$|Robotic {{spacecraft}} {{on other}} celestial bodies {{are under the}} influence of extreme environmental conditions. Especially the aggressive dust is a thread for mechanical systems like actuators. Scope of this thesis is the rotational seal, which protects the interior from the environment. For the ILM 38 -actuators, which were developed at the German Aerospace Centre’s Robotics and Mechatronics Institute for deployment on Moon and Mars, industrial Teflon-seals were used, but with disappointing results. My first task was to research on the environmental conditions and which other sealing concepts were already developed for space rovers, as well as to find companies, which offer suitable seals. It turned out, that spring-loaded Teflon-seals are indeed the most promising approach. I selected two companies, ElringKlinger and GFD, which offered suggestions for the specified problem. Prior my thesis, a test bed was constructed to measure friction torque, temperature and the sealing quality of different seals with various shaft-surfaces. The trials should be conducted in vacuum, so my second task was to modify the testbed. One problem was that the included torque measurement device is not vacuum-proof. The whole test bed was separated in two parts, with the actuator and seal inside the chamber and the torque measurement device outside. Before the actual tests could begin, the measurement error induced by the transmission shaft needed to be determined. This data was not yet available, so I measured in experiments and wrote a correction program. After the phase of preparation was completed, three different seal types (the old seal and two new ones) with four surface coatings for the shaft (which provided different surface roughnesses for the aluminium material) were ready for testing: To enhance the precision of the results, three independent test runs were performed for each seal/surface-combination, utilising unused seals. It turned out that except two events, the <b>leakproofness</b> was always provided. However, after analysis of the results, the model from ElringKlinger performed best in comparison. This seal consists of a spring-loaded Teflon-seal with one sealing element and small dimensions. The second seal, the model from GFD, was similar in appearance, but possessed two sealing elements, which lead to a much higher friction torque. At two surface coatings, the friction was so high, that the tests were not possible at all. It also turned out, that a certain degree of surface roughness is necessary for operation, while to smooth or too rough surfaces showed worse results...|$|E
