25|$|On September 1, 2009, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin DeNoce {{ruled that}} the {{addition}} of a lying-in-wait allegation to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> was acceptable. The addition of this allegation would automatically mean that the case must be heard in an adult court. The addition was petitioned, and in November the Ventura 2nd District Appellate Court denied the request to overturn the earlier ruling, finding that the District Attorney’s Office did not act vindictively in adding the lying-in-wait allegation to the murder charge.|$|E

In 14 of these cases, Haarmann acknowledged his guilt, although he claimed to be uncertain of the identification of the remaining 13 victims upon the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges.</b> Grans pleaded not guilty to charges of being an accessory to murder in several of the murders. The trial was conducted behind closed doors, and all permitted to enter the courtroom were thoroughly searched.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} days, Chikatilo confessed to a further 22 killings {{which had not}} been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast, because the bodies had not been found, or, {{in the case of}} Yelena Zakotnova, because an innocent man had been convicted and executed for the murder. (Aleksandr Kravchenko received a posthumous pardon for Yelena Zakotnova's murder.) As had been the case with the victims compiled upon the initial <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges,</b> Chikatilo was able to provide details of these additional killings only the perpetrator could have known: one of these additional victims, 14-year-old Lyubov Volobuyeva, had lived in south-western Siberia, and had been killed in a sorghum field near Krasnodar Airport on 25 July 1982. Chikatilo recalled that he had killed Volobuyeva in a millet field, and that he had approached the girl as she sat in the waiting rooms at Krasnodar Airport. Volobuyeva, Chikatilo stated, had informed him she lived in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, and was awaiting a connecting flight at the airport to visit relatives.|$|E

Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom Chikatilo had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. Chikatilo recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named [...] "Bars" [...] would retaliate for his attacking her.

2500|$|The 8 April 1950 bomb incident, {{in which}} 4 Jews were injured, was {{omitted from the}} charge sheet against {{the members of the}} underground, {{although}} it appeared in the government statement. The prosecutor [...] "claimed that the perpetrators had planned to cause injury but not loss of life. The grenade, however, had claimed five lives at the synagogue (or four, according to the charges) and injured more than 20 people. This did not prevent the prosecutor, in his concluding address, from including this incident in the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> against the underground, although this contradicted the evidence of the two witnesses." [...] Nevertheless, they were not accused for the Synagogue bombing.|$|E
2500|$|Josephus relates that Herodias, jealous at Agrippa's success, persuaded Antipas to ask Caligula for {{the title}} of king for himself. However, Agrippa {{simultaneously}} presented the emperor with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> against the tetrarch: allegedly, he had conspired against Tiberius with Sejanus (executed in 31 AD) and was now plotting against Caligula with Artabanus. As evidence, Agrippa noted that Antipas had a stockpile of weaponry sufficient for 70,000 men. Hearing Antipas' admission to this last charge, Caligula decided to credit the allegations of conspiracy. In the summer of 39 AD, Antipas' money and territory were turned over to Agrippa, while he himself was exiled. The place of his exile is given by Josephus' Antiquities as [...] "Lugdunum" [...] in Gaul. (This may mean either the city of Lugdunum now known as Lyon, or the less important Lugdunum Convenarum, modern Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges.) Caligula offered to allow Herodias, as Agrippa's sister, to retain her property. However, she chose instead to join her husband in exile.|$|E
