50|$|On the {{exterior}} of the car, low overhang and good ground clearance allows the Terranaut to traverse into rough terrain. Instead of a trunk {{at the back of the}} car, the Terranaut features an air <b>lock</b> <b>drawer,</b> which allows easy and safe access to clinical samples placed in the air <b>lock</b> <b>drawer</b> by someone on the outside by a lab analyst still inside the car. External displays and touch screens on the rear of the car allow those on the outside data access to information stored inside the vehicle. A controlled atmosphere on the interior may be maintained through the use of highly reflective glass, which bars sun, glare, snow or ice from disrupting scientific analysis inside the vehicle.|$|R

60|$|On hearing June's name, {{she went}} hurriedly to her bedroom, and, taking two large bracelets from a red morocco {{case in a}} <b>locked</b> <b>drawer,</b> put them on her white wrists--for she possessed in a {{remarkable}} degree that 'sense of property,' which, as we know, is the touchstone of Forsyteism, and the foundation of good morality.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not change}} his clothes, but, after {{lighting}} the candle, took off his watch and chain, laid them on the table, {{and sat down at}} once to write.

50|$|During {{the summer}} {{prior to his}} eighth and final year at the Orël gymnasium, Preobrazhensky worked as a RSDLP propagandist to the workers of the Dyatkovo factory in Bryansky raion. Preobrazhensky was able to recruit {{the son of the}} Bryansky police to the RSDLP and {{successfully}} managed to conceal his small rotary mimeograph machine from searching authorities in a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> of the inspector's own desk. Periodic meetings were held in the neighboring forest.|$|R
60|$|Mackintosh {{disengaged}} {{his hand}} from the dead man's, and staggering like one drunk with sleep he {{went out of the}} room. He went to the <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> in his writing-desk and took out the revolver. He walked down to the sea and walked into the lagoon; he waded out cautiously, so that he should not trip against a coral rock, till the water came to his arm-pits. Then he put a bullet through his head.|$|R
50|$|William's son, James Wilson, was {{concerned}} {{to provide all}} the boy employees (over 1,000) with a bible, a hymn book and an arithmetic book in their own <b>locked</b> <b>drawer.</b> James was an evangelical Christian and, by providing free breakfasts and suppers and free baths, a pioneer in workers' welfare. The famous novelists Elizabeth Gaskell and Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote enthusiastically about these reforms. In time, a model village was built adjoining the factory at Bromborough Pool near Birkenhead.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Pendyce {{went to his}} study, {{took some}} papers from a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer,</b> and sat a long time looking at them. One was the draft of his will, another {{a list of the}} {{holdings}} at Worsted Skeynes, their acreage and rents, a third a fair copy of the settlement, re-settling the estate when he had married. It was at this piece of supreme irony that Mr. Pendyce looked longest. He did not read it, but he thought: ...|$|R
3000|$|When {{asked about}} her English {{textbook}} she looked puzzled for a moment. “Oh, the main book,” she said finally, and started searching for it. Eventually she located it in a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer.</b> The book seemed new. Her class teacher never taught from the book, she explained, and he had told the class {{that there would be}} nothing from the textbook in the examination. “From the beginning of the school,” she said, “our teacher suggested the Nobodut Guide. There are many model tests in it. Our teacher selects which ones will be important and teaches us accordingly.” [...]...|$|R
50|$|Vernon-Smith now {{plans to}} take further action against Prout. He {{makes his way to}} the Headmaster’s study, {{intending}} to leave it in a parlous state. But, as he enters, he finds Loder, trying to force his way into a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> in Prout’s desk. A ghastly pallor sweeps over Loder’s face, {{and for a moment he}} seems as if he is going to faint - but he swiftly recovers and inflicts a savage beating on Vernon-Smith. On his return to his study, Smithy confides to Redwing his suspicion that Loder was attempting to steal Mauleverer’s banknote. Redwing, shocked, says the suggestion is impossible.|$|R
5000|$|Bertie dashes to {{his room}} to {{relocate}} the parcel, but is unable to find {{the key to the}} drawer in which it is locked, and is busy looking for it when Willoughby enters and awkwardly announces his intent to search the room for Berkeley's cigarette case. When he reaches the <b>locked</b> <b>drawer,</b> Jeeves enters the room and offers him the key, which he had found in Bertie's clothes from the previous evening. Bertie [...] "could have massacred the man" [...] until, to his surprise, Willoughby opens the drawer and discovers that it is empty. He departs, apologising for the intrusion.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{mind was}} like her room, in which lights {{advanced}} and retreated, came pirouetting and stepping delicately, spread their tails, pecked their way; {{and then her}} whole being was suffused, like the room again, with a cloud of some profound knowledge, some unspoken regret, {{and then she was}} full of <b>locked</b> <b>drawers,</b> stuffed with letters, like her cabinets. Virginia Woolf, The Lady in the Looking Glass: A Reflection Sands and Hudson divided their time between England and France to accommodate their lifestyle preferences. Hudson enjoyed living a relatively quiet life in France and Sands liked the London and Oxford social life.|$|R
6000|$|Inside {{the first}} shell were several <b>locked</b> <b>drawers,</b> {{and two or}} three open ones, out of one of which Harold had fished the false will. Instinct taught me somehow that the central drawer on the {{left-hand}} side was the compartment behind which lay the secret receptacle. I prised it apart and peered about inside it. Presently I saw a slip-panel, which I touched with one finger. The pigeon-hole flew open and disclosed a narrow slit I clutched at something--the will! Ho, victory! the will! I raised it aloft with a wild shout. Not a doubt of it! The real, the genuine document! ...|$|R

50|$|In Episode 11, Betty corners Don, {{after getting}} into a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> in the desk in his home office that {{contains}} pictures and documents of Don's past life. (Don had inadvertently left his keys in his clothes, and Betty heard them jingling in the dryer.) She forces him to give her an explanation, and he haltingly tells her about his life as Dick Whitman, {{how he came to}} exchange dog tags with Lieutenant Don Draper, and his half-brother Adam's suicide. While apparently somewhat sympathetic to his feelings of guilt about Adam's death, Betty is highly conflicted about Don's having hidden this aspect of his life from her.|$|R
50|$|Many {{optimized}} {{features are}} available for anesthesiology carts. To keep anesthesia tools safe and {{in the hands of}} authorized users, <b>locking</b> <b>drawers</b> are a useful option. These same anesthesiology supplies cart drawers glide smoothly on rolling sliders to prevent displacement or wobbling. Built-in stabilizing bases increase anesthesia storage cart stability and prevent tipping during transport. Easy-grip push handles and smooth-rolling and locking casters provide for maximum anesthesiologist cart maneuverability. Anesthesiology carts are available in many different sizes and colors to accommodate specific facility needs. Colors are often used by facilities to coordinate which cart belongs in which room in the hospital or medical center.|$|R
6000|$|By-and-by, {{while the}} aunt was sipping her wine; {{and the boy}} eating his cake, and both their {{eyes were fixed on}} the {{portrait}} in question; little Pierre, pushing his stool nearer the picture exclaimed--"Now, aunt, did papa really look exactly like that? Did you ever see him in that same buff vest, and huge-figured neckcloth? I remember the seal and key, pretty well; and it was only a week ago that I saw mamma take them out of a little <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> in her wardrobe--but I don't remember the queer whiskers; nor the buff vest; nor the huge white-figured neckcloth; did you ever see papa in that very neckcloth, aunt?" ...|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} his room, Midwinter closed the door, and hurriedly filled a {{bag with the}} necessaries for traveling. This done, he took from a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer,</b> {{and placed in the}} breast pocket of his coat, some little presents which Allan had given him--a cigar case, a purse, and a set of studs in plain gold. Having possessed himself of these memorials, he snatched up the bag and laid his hand on the door. There, for the first time, he paused. There, the headlong haste of all his actions thus far suddenly ceased, and the hard despair in his face began to soften: he waited, with the door in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he went to}} {{a locked}} closet, and took from a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> therein a small {{circular}} case the size of a pillbox, and was about to put it into his pocket. But he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary glance inside. It contained a woman's finger-ring, set all the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had evidently been recently purchased. Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long time, though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain from his manner and mien, which were those of a mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel's future history.|$|R

500|$|Cope insisted {{through his}} will that no graveside service or burial be held; he had donated {{his body to}} science. He issued a final {{challenge}} to Marsh at his death: he had his skull donated to science so his brain could be measured, hoping his brain would be larger than that of his adversary; at the time, [...] brain size {{was thought to be}} the true measure of intelligence. Marsh never accepted the challenge, and Cope's skull is reportedly still preserved at the University of Pennsylvania. His ashes were placed at the institute with those of Leidy, while his bones were extracted and kept in a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> to be studied by anatomy students.|$|R

30|$|Priya’s story emphasises the {{importance}} given {{by students and}} their families to success in the national examination. Her dedication to her study and her parents’ willingness to invest in private classes are typical of many students and families throughout Bangladesh. The number of coaching classes she attends is also common for those in her age group with parents who can afford it. It is significant that the formal textbook, which focuses on communicative English, was tucked away in a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> and instead she and her teachers (both at school and in private tuition) relied on a commercial study guide and crib sheets of grammar exercises and adaptable compositions. Her experiences are suggestive of ways that examinations shape teaching and learning at secondary level, especially in encouraging a predominance of rote learning.|$|R
5000|$|Next {{would follow}} what White {{refers to as}} the [...] "Dossier Scene". Briggs or Phelps would be shown in a fancy apartment, {{retrieving}} an oversized, leather-bound folder from a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer.</b> Inside this folder were plastic-wrapped dossiers (usually featuring standard 8×10 [...] "glossies" [...] of the respective actors) of the available IMF agents. Briggs/Phelps would toss the selected agents' dossiers onto a table. According to White, most of the never-chosen dossiers were photographs of various series staffers and their wives, including Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Geller. A contemporary article in TV Guide claimed that many of the photos put aside in the [...] "dossier scene" [...] were of studio and network executives and that it was considered a measure of one's status in the studio and network hierarchies to appear there, but White makes no such statement.|$|R
6000|$|He got up slowly, {{leaving his}} lunch unfinished--the letter had {{come by the}} one o'clock post--and went into his study. He rang for his housekeeper, {{and told her to}} go round the house at once, examine all the {{fastenings}} of the windows, and close all the shutters. He closed the shutters of his study himself. From a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> in his bedroom he took a little revolver, examined it carefully, and put it {{into the pocket of his}} lounge jacket. He wrote a number of brief notes, one to Colonel Adye, gave them to his servant to take, with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house. [...] "There is no danger," [...] he said, and added a mental reservation, [...] "to you." [...] He remained meditative for a space after doing this, and then returned to his cooling lunch.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the book}} Pollen by Mancunian author Jeff Noon {{two of the}} central {{characters}} visit Strangeways in order {{to speak to a}} prisoner.

6000|$|This evening, {{fugitive}} {{as usual}} before the Pope and his works, I mounted the staircase, approached the dormitory, and quietly opened the door, which was always kept carefully shut, and which, {{like every other}} door in this house, revolved noiselessly on well-oiled hinges. Before I saw, I felt that life was in the great room, usually void: {{not that there was}} either stir or breath, or rustle of sound, but Vacuum lacked, Solitude was not at home. All the white beds--the [...] "lits d'ange," [...] as they were poetically termed--lay visible at a glance; all were empty: no sleeper reposed therein. The sound of a drawer cautiously slid out struck my ear; stepping a little to one side, my vision took a free range, unimpeded by falling curtains. I now commanded my own bed and my own toilet, with a locked work-box upon it, and <b>locked</b> <b>drawers</b> underneath.|$|R
60|$|She {{went upstairs}} and took from a <b>locked</b> <b>drawer</b> a little box, {{out of which}} she poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there many a year. There were a hundred in all, and she divided them into two heaps, fifty in each. Tying up these in small canvas bags, she {{went down to the}} garden and called to Christian Cantle, who was {{loitering}} about in hope of a supper which was not really owed him. Mrs. Yeobright gave him the moneybags, charged him to go to Mistover, and on no account to deliver them into any one's hands save her son's and Thomasin's. On further thought she deemed it advisable to tell Christian precisely what the two bags contained, that he might be fully impressed with their importance. Christian pocketed the money-bags, promised the greatest carefulness, and set out on his way.|$|R
