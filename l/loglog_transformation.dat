Two models were developed to predict the survival rate of young larvae of drugstore beetle, Stegobium paniceum (L.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) under steady state or transient temperature condition: modified fundamental kinetic model and modified complementary <b>loglog</b> <b>transformation</b> model. Published young larvae mortalities and raw data of the temperature history, determined at different heat treatment temperatures, were used to develop these models. The models were verified and compared by using the field data collected in a medium sized mill. Both of the developed models overestimated the insect mortality in the mill when temperature was > 53 °C and underestimated insect mortality when temperature was < 50 °C. The lowest mean of the absolute difference between the predicted and measured insect mortality in the mill was 16. 7 ± 1. 1 % which was generated by using the modified complementary log-log transformation model. The possible reason of this divergence from the model is discussed...|$|E

Trata-se de estudo transversal, com popula????o constitu??da de 811 m??es de crian??as menores de cinco meses de idade, selecionadas aleatoriamente em cinco unidades b??sicas de sa??de (UBS) no Munic??pio do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. A exposi????o de interesse central foi o local de nascimento da crian??a: Hospital Amigo da Crian??a (HAC), em vias de receber a titula????o (EVHAC) e sem a titula????o. Optou-se pelo modelo de an??lise de sobrevida log-log complementar, que recomp??e a experi??ncia {{longitudinal}} da coorte, caracterizando abordagem do tipo current status. Mesmo ap??s o controle por vari??veis sociodemogr??ficas, relativas ao estilo de vida e aos aspectos psicossociais maternos, ?? utiliza????o dos servi??os de sa??de, idade e sa??de da crian??a, houve maior dura????o do AME em crian??as nascidas em HAC e EVHAC. Os resultados sugerem a efetividade da IHAC na manuten????o de AME nos primeiros meses de vida, refor??ando a necessidade de ampliar sua cobertura para todo o territ??rio nacional. This article aims {{to investigate}} {{the impact of the}} Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). This was a crosssectional study with 811 mothers of infants under five months of age, randomly selected at five health centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The exposure variable was hospital of birth, categorized in accredited hospitals (BFH), certified hospitals (CBFH), and hospitals without accreditation. The data were analyzed by complementary <b>loglog</b> <b>transformation</b> models, which capture cohort longitudinal experience (current status data). Even after adjusting the analysis for maternal socio-demographic, lifestyle, and psychological factors, health services use, and infants??? age and health status, duration of EBF was longer in infants born in BFH and CBFH. The findings suggest the effectiveness of BFHI in maintaining EBF throughout the early months of life. To extend EBF through {{the first six months of}} life would require not only strengthening the BFHI but also developing and encouraging more actions in favor of breastfeeding, focusing on primary healthcare facilities...|$|E
