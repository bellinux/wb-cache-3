5000|$|At about 1:45 p.m., Sergeant Quinton Blackwell saw {{an object}} from his {{position}} in the control tower at Fort Knox. Two other witnesses in the tower also reported a white object in the distance. Colonel Guy Hix, the base commander, reported an object he described as [...] "very white," [...] and [...] "about one fourth {{the size of the}} full moon ... Through binoculars it appeared to have a red border at the bottom ... It remained stationary, seemingly, for one and a half hours." [...] Observers at Clinton County Army Air Field in Ohio described the object [...] "as having the appearance of a flaming red cone trailing a gaseous green mist" [...] and observed the object for around 35 minutes. [...] Another observer at Lockbourne Army Air Field in Ohio noted, [...] "Just before leaving it came to very near the ground, staying down for about ten seconds, then climbed at a very fast rate back to its original altitude, 10,000 <b>feet,</b> <b>leveling</b> off and disappearing into the overcast heading 120 degrees. Its speed was greater than 500 mph in level flight." ...|$|R
