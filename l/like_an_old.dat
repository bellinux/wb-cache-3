5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor in the vestibule built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is {{the largest of the}} MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed to look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) {{dressing}} room {{is now a}} temporary room for a technician (Meng Ai) as Jack is renting space on the TGS floor in the 30 Rock building to keep the budget down, as a result Jenna is forced to share a {{dressing room}} with her TGS co-star Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson). Immediately, the two start behaving <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> married couple. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets upset about Jenna and Danny fighting and decides to stop their bickering. Kenneth interrupts one of their arguments by showing them a childish picture he drew of the two. This works to no avail as Jenna and Danny continue arguing. To {{put a stop to}} this, Danny moves out from his dressing room and into the Y.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

25|$|George Lucas's Star Wars films use many {{elements}} of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for Star Wars to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The Jedi, who take their name from Jidaigeki, are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character Han Solo dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the Mos Eisley Cantina is much <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> West saloon.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Felt {{moved to}} Santa Rosa, California, from Alexandria, Virginia, his home since the 1970s. In 1992, {{he bought a}} house in Santa Rosa and after that lived with his {{daughter}} Joan Felt. He suffered a stroke before 1999, reported Ronald Kessler in his book The Bureau. According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the home of Felt's daughter and took him to lunch. Joan Felt, who was taking care of him at her home, told Kessler her father greeted Woodward <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend, and their mysterious meeting appeared {{to be more of a}} celebration than an interview.|$|E

25|$|Rufus Scrimgeour {{serves as}} the Minister for Magic of the United Kingdom, {{succeeding}} Cornelius Fudge who was ousted by the wizarding community for his failure to announce the return of Voldemort, discrediting Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, and allowing Dolores Umbridge to become Headmistress of Hogwarts, from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince {{until his death in}} the following book. He is described as looking <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> lion with tawny hair and bushy eyebrows, yellow eyes and wire-rimmed spectacles. Before being selected as minister, Scrimgeour headed the Auror Office of the Ministry and he is heavily battle-scarred from his years of service as an Auror, giving him an appearance of shrewd toughness. As minister, he visits the Muggle Prime Minister with Fudge, now an advisor, to inform him about recent wizarding events, crucial to internal security.|$|E
25|$|There {{originally}} {{was a brief}} shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies of her jumping over a log and getting shot by man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, {{and that it was}} emotional enough to justify having her death occurring off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work {{in the context of the}} film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.|$|E

500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely put {{one foot in front of}} the other and walked <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> thing".|$|E

His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney, and Peter O'Toole, but Epstein dropped {{out after the}} third term, {{saying that he had}} become [...] "too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn't like being a student at all." [...] He said in 1964 that he [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man at the age of 21".

500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful [...] "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona into something <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally.

RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin described the album as [...] "a flight that you can actually enjoy from start to finish". The Sunday Tribunes Neil Dunphy selected it as his CD of the week, calling it [...] "a wonderful exploration of a sound often derided for being in thrall to its influences" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't know why but Bell X1 used to make me cringe. These days their music feels <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend; something solid and inspiring amid all the negativity".|$|E
500|$|Moulting is {{repeated}} periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or {{moves to a}} safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake [...] "crawls" [...] out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.|$|E
500|$|The book {{arose from}} a series of {{articles}} written over the winter of 1898 for the Yorkshire Evening Post, in which he interviewed former players and reflected their experiences after retirement. Encountering the desperate circumstances in which many former players lived, Pullin was moved to campaign on their behalf. Hodgson suggests that he [...] "did not mince his words... He held a deep regard for the players, and found it difficult to contemplate the forlorn situation and desperate straits that several of the old Yorkshire cricketers he interviewed were faced with." [...] When investigating the whereabouts of John Thewlis, Pullin was told [...] "Think dead; if not, Manchester". Pullin later wrote about Thewlis: [...] "The moral responsibilities of cricket managers, so far as a player is concerned, should surely not end with the termination of his active career. He ought not to be cast aside <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> shoe." ...|$|E
