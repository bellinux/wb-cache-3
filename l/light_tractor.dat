50|$|The Carden-Loyd tankettes by Carden-Loyd Tractors, Ltd., were {{promising}} {{enough that}} the company was purchased by Vickers-Armstrong. They developed light, floating tanks to General Staff requirements (A4E11 etc). In April 1931, Vickers-Armstrongs conducted several successful tests of these light vehicles {{in the presence of the}} press. Publication of the design and testing by the press attracted the attention of the Department of Motorization and Mechanization of the Workers'-Peasants' Red Army (UMMRKKA), because the small tank was well suited to the new armament policies of the Red Army, as well as possibly being able to replace the older T-27 tankette, which never performed well in combat. At the Bolshevik OKMO plant in Leningrad, from the All Russian Co-Operative Society (Arcos), newspapers were handed in containing information about the British tankette, as well as photographs and technical specifications. Based on this information, Soviet engineers found out that the power plant of the Carden-Loyd tankette was originally from a <b>light</b> <b>tractor</b> produced by the company, and thus the overall layout must be similar. Accordingly, the Selezen ("Drake", Ru. Селезень) program was established in order to construct a similar amphibious tank with a layout based on that of the British prototype. The first Selezen prototype, which was designated the T-33, was built in March 1932 and showed good buoyancy during testing. However, the T-33 did not perform satisfactorily in other tests and was too complicated for the existing military-industrial complex to produce. As a result, it was not mass produced or equipped in large numbers.|$|E

5000|$|By 1901 Straker were {{building}} an entire wagon [...] This exchanged the previous gear {{drive to the}} rear axle with a chain drive. Although other steam wagons used chain drives, {{this was the first}} to use a single chain, with the differential mounted on the axle rather than the chassis, and with a chain to each wheel. The rear wheels were large in diameter and constructed on the traction engine pattern, with two rows of narrow built-up spokes. As these wheels were too large to fit under the load deck of the wagon, they were mounted outboard of it, requiring an extra-long axle. These wagons were sold by the 'Straker Steam Vehicle Co' with offices at 9 Bush Lane, London and the works in Bristol. They took part in the War Office Trials at Aldershot of 1901, where they were awarded £100, and 1902 By 1902 the rear wheels had been reduced in diameter and now had six broader spokes from a flat sheet: a single sheet for the 2 ton, doubled for the 5 and 7 ton models. The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound, with cylinders of 7" [...] stroke and 4" [...] and 7" [...] diameter. The transmission was relatively crude, using open gears rather than the enclosed oil-bath that was in use amongst other makers, and indeed used for the high-speed engine of their 2-ton <b>light</b> <b>tractor.</b> Two gears were provided, but one was only intended for hill-climbing and could only be selected from alongside the engine, not from the driver's cab.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{with various}} traffic regimes in {{grassland}} (no traffic, light and medium tractor with two mechanisation lines; forage harvester and two-step harvesting) and three fertilization levels (N 120, 180, 240 kg ha- 1) {{were carried out}} in five fields on sandy soils and peat soils in Bodø, northern Norway. Increased tractor weight caused significant decrease in yields on the peat soils with both mechanisation lines. When the peat soils {{were exposed to the}} <b>light</b> <b>tractor</b> treatments, DM yields increased significantly as the fertilization level rose from N 120 kg ha- 1 to N 180 kg ha- 1, but not for further increase to N 240 kg ha- 1. With the medium tractor treatments, there was no significant yield increase from N 120 kg ha- 1 to N 180 kg ha- 1, but a further increase to N 240 kg ha- 1 gave significantly higher yields. Use of lighter machines on peat soils may therefore lead to reduced fertilizer costs for farmers, and decrease the risk of leaching from the soil. On the sandy soils, yields were significantly lower at the medium tractor treatment with two-step harvest compared to no traffic. With the exception of decreased air-filled porosity at 1 - 5 cm depth of the peat soils no significant change in soil physical properties of the plough layer were measured. Therefore, the negative impact of traffic on plant growth was more likely due to plant injury than impaired soil conditions. vo...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} tractor traffic on grassland yield, soil porosity and penetration resistance in three field trials on contrasting soils in different regions of Norway (medium sand at Tjøtta, Nordland, silty medium sand at Fureneset, Sogn og Fjordane, silt at Løken, Oppland). The trials had a split-plot design with three levels of two wheel-by-wheel tractor passes after each cut (no traffic, <b>light</b> <b>tractor</b> 3 - 4 Mg, heavy tractor 6 - 7 Mg), three different seed mixtures and two fertilization levels. At three other field trials (Balsfjord in Troms, Fjærland in Sogn og Fjordane and Hokksund in Buskerud) impacts of both traffic and the inclusion of clovers in the seed mixture on grassland yield and penetration resistance were studied. These trials had a split-plot design with three levels of one wheel-by-wheel tractor and harvesting machinery pass and three different seed mixtures. During the first three ley years the yield reduction by tractor traffic was 26 % at Løken, 4 % at Fureneset and zero at Tjøtta. There was {{a positive correlation between}} yield reduction and the soil moisture content at wheeling. Tractor traffic reduced pore volume and air capacity and increased bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, with the largest effect on the silty soil at Løken and the smallest on the sandy soil at Tjøtta. Prediction of soil compaction by using the Terranimo® model gave a good picture of the situation at Fureneset and Tjøtta, but at Løken the soil was far more compacted than predicted by the model. The depth of tracks after wheeling was not found to give a reliable measure of soil compaction effects, as the yield reduction on the silty soil at Løken was far larger than at Tjøtta and Fureneset at the same level of track depth. In the field trials at Balsfjord, Fjærland and Hokksund the yield reduction after wheeling varied between 8 and 27 % and penetration resistance increased. Inclusion of clovers (red and white) in the seed mixture increased yields at second cuts, but 30 % clover compared to 15 % did not affect yields. During these first three years of the experimental period {{there were no significant differences}} in either yield, soil physical properties or penetration resistance between wheeling with light or heavy tractors at any of the sites. At Løken and Fureneset, the experimental period was extended for two years. At Løken the experimental setup was kept the same and the yield reduction from traffic was about 15 %. At Fureneset the number of cuts and wheelings was increased from two to three times per year, and both the fertilization level and tyre pressure were also increased. This gave significant yield reductions in the third cuts. In the last year of the experimental period (2015) there was also a significant beneficial effect on yield of using a <b>light</b> <b>tractor</b> rather than a heavy tractor. Overall soil texture and soil moisture content are major factors explaining traffic effects on soil physical properties and grassland yield. It seems that these factors explain more of the yield reduction than do the weight of tractors and machinery, at least in the short run when using low tyre pressures...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{draught control}} system, as fitted to modern tractors, {{consists of a}} negative feed back control system that adjusts the working depth of mounted or semi mounted soil engaging implements {{in an attempt to}} regulate the draught requirements of the implement. The system has become important in agricultural production because it increases the efficiency of tractor operations in two ways. Firstly, by controlling the draught requirements of an implement the draught control system allows tractor engine efficiency to be optimised. Secondly, by transferring some of the weight of the implement onto the rear wheels of the tractor, wheel slip is reduced and controlled. This latter function, more than any other, was responsible for the major change in the design concept of <b>tractors,</b> permitting smaller, <b>lighter</b> <b>tractors</b> to do the same work as their heavier predecessors, pulling trailed implements.
