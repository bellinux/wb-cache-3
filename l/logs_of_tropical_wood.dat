30|$|The lesser {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> {{species on}} their colour {{changes in the}} initial period of exposure was observed in more works [25, 30, 31]. Similarly, in our work, oil finish in the bangkirai shade had a more positive effect on massaranduba wood. On the other hand, more colour stable for other wood species (bangkirai, kusia, jatoba) was oil finish with the teak shade. A possible explanation for this observation is that the specific type and content of different extractives in massaranduba wood influenced the colour change of the pigment in the used oil. Effect of different species <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> on their colour stability after treatment with pigmented paints was also found in other works [19, 24, 25].|$|R

Thermal properties of wood polymer composites in terms of thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were evaluated, and an improvement in thermal stability was found on ethyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate–hexamethylene diisocyanate treatment. A significant improvement in decay resistance was also identified in wood polymer composites that were treated with ethyl methacrylate, and also, with ethyl methacrylate–hexamethylene diisocyanate. The improvement in properties was observed as more potential with ethyl methacrylate–hexamethylene diisocyanate combination rather than ethyl methacrylate.

30|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>wood</b> {{species are}} usually characterised {{by a high}} {{durability}} against biodegradation agents due {{to the presence of}} specific extractive substances—flavonoids, tannins, etc. However, to the colour changes of wood exposed in exterior conditions significantly contribute not only extractives [1 – 4], but also lignin [5 – 7]. The colour changes <b>of</b> some <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> caused by weathering were observed in more scientific papers [1, 2, 8 – 10]. Generally, the colour stability <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> significantly depends not only on the wood species and the surface treatment methods, but also on the area of their exposure [10, 11]. Due to their specific properties, i.e. usually high resistance to biological agents, high density and high resistance to mechanical wear, high-dimensional stability, and good aesthetic, <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> are used as wood decking, claddings, garden constructions and furniture in various world regions, including Central Europe.|$|R

Mixed monomers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were effectively impregnated into the cellular structure of several types <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood,</b> which then underwent a catalyst-thermal process to polymerize and form WPC. The manufacturing of WPC was confirmed through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. The SEM observation showed that polymer converted from monomers filled up wood cell cavities and tightly interacted with wood matrix. The X-ray diffraction results reveal {{that the degree of}} crystallinity was significantly improved upon impregnation with PVA-co-MMA copolymer. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and compressive modulus were found to be significantly higher after treatment with MMA/PVA indicating improvement of mechanical properties of the wood samples.

30|$|The {{pigments}} in {{the vegetable}} oils used for treatment <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> reduced their colour changes during weathering (Figs.  2, 3, 4). During natural weathering, this result for the ΔE* {{was confirmed by}} a statistical analyses, as well (Table  4). The positive effect of pigments well corresponds {{with the work of}} Kropf et al.

30|$|Overall, it is {{possible}} to say that the finishing vegetable Woca Denmark oils stabilised the colour <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> only during shorter exposure, and mainly if pigmented oils were used. This can be explained by a lower permeability of exotic woods, when a lower penetration of oils could not save surface layers of wood for a longer time [24]. Vegetable oils only impregnated the surface layers of wood, and result was a faster washout of oils due to the weathering. The painted surfaces of wood must be regularly renewed, and thus it {{is possible}}, mainly through pigmented treatment adjustments, to keep colour fastness in exterior exposures.|$|R
