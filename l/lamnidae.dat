5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family <b>Lamnidae,</b> the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into <b>Lamnidae,</b> genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E
500|$|The {{longfin mako}} shark (Isurus paucus) is {{a species of}} {{mackerel}} shark in the family <b>Lamnidae,</b> with a probable worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical waters.

The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported {{to a depth of}} [...] Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} [...] "cold-blooded" [...] or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their {{internal}} body temperature matches {{that of their}} ambient environment. Members of the family <b>Lamnidae</b> (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located {{near the center of}} the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile ("miraculous net"). The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently.|$|E
500|$|Megalodon (Carcharocles megalodon), meaning [...] "big tooth," [...] is an {{extinct species}} of shark that lived {{approximately}} 23 to 2.6 {{million years ago}} (mya), during the Early Miocene {{to the end of}} the Pliocene. There has been some debate regarding the taxonomy of megalodon: some researchers argued that it was of the family <b>Lamnidae</b> and closely related to the great white shark, while others argued that it belonged to the extinct family Otodontidae; presently, there is consensus that the latter view is correct. Its genus placement, however, is still debated, with authors placing it in either Carcharocles, Megaselachus, Otodus, or Procarcharodon. The shark has made appearances in several media, such as the Discovery Channel's docufiction [...]|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family <b>Lamnidae</b> – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} (Lamna nasus) is {{a species}} of mackerel shark in the family <b>Lamnidae,</b> distributed widely {{in the cold and}} temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. In the North Pacific, its ecological equivalent is the closely related salmon shark (L.ditropis). The porbeagle typically reaches [...] in length and a weight of North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow base of the tail. It has large pectoral and first dorsal fins, tiny pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins, and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.|$|E
500|$|The {{great white}} shark came into {{existence}} during the mid-Miocene epoch. The earliest known fossils of the {{great white shark}} are about 16 million years old. However, the phylogeny of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a prehistoric shark, such as the C.megalodon. C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those of great white sharks, but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to [...] and [...] Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C.megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon {{was applied to the}} latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C.megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family <b>Lamnidae).</b> The great white is also more closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis, than to the C.megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012. In addition, the new hypothesis assigns C.megalodon to the genus Carcharocles, which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks; Otodus obliquus is the ancient representative of the extinct Carcharocles lineage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reproductive}} {{pattern is}} similar to that of many of the <b>Lamnidae,</b> the shark family to which sand tigers belong. Female sand tigers have two uterine horns that, during early embryonic development, may have as many as 50 embryos that obtain nutrients from their yolk sacs and possibly consume uterine fluids. When one of the embryos reaches some [...] in length, it eats all the smaller embryos so that only one large embryo remains in each uterine horn, a process called intrauterine cannibalism i.e. [...] "embryophagy" [...] or, more colorfully, adelphophagy — literally [...] "eating one's brother." [...] While multiple male sand tigers commonly fertilize a single female, adelphophagy sometimes excludes all but one of them from gaining offspring. These surviving embryos continue to feed on a steady supply of unfertilised eggs. After a lengthy labour, the female gives birth to [...] long, fully independent offspring. The gestation period is approximately eight to twelve months. These sharks give birth only every second or third year, resulting in an overall mean reproductive rate of less than one pup per year, one of the lowest reproductive rates for sharks.|$|E

50|$|The taxonomic {{assignment}} of C. megalodon had been debated {{for nearly a}} century, but has recently reached consensus.
