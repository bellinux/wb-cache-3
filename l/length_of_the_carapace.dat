40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about {{potential}} effects of ocean acidification on krill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere as ecologically very important food web component. Sub-adult individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern Atlantic krill species Nyctiphanes couchii (caught at Austevoll near Bergen, Norway, in January 2013) were exposed in the laboratory to four different levels of pCO 2 (430, 800, 1, 100, and 1, 700 µatm) for 5 weeks in order to assess potential changes in a set of biological response variables. Survival decreased and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> moulting-related deaths increased with increasing pCO 2. Survival was considerably reduced at relatively high pCO 2 of 1, 700 µatm and tended to be negatively affected at 1, 100 µatm pCO 2.

40|$|Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1835) is {{the only}} species of fiddler crab that occurs in Portugal, where it mainly inhabits salt marshes {{in the south and}} {{southwest}} coasts.

40|$|Abstract The paper {{contributes}} to the systematics of the family Cyprididae and to {{a description of the}} general ostracod biodiversity in Australia. Riocypris hinzeae sp. nov., is described from wells in the Murchison region (Western Australia). This is the second species described in the genus, previously known from South America. Another two species are transferred into this genus: Riocypris fitzroyi (McKenzie, 1966) comb. nov. and R. fontana (Graf, 1931) comb. nov. Cyprinotus cingalensis Brady, 1886, collected from wells in the Pilbara Region (Western Australia), is redescribed. Populations of some other described Cyprinotus species show extreme variability in morphology and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>carapace</b> and the following species are thus synonymized with C. cingalensis: C. dahli Sars, 1896; C. uenoi Brehm, 1936; C. kimberleyensis McKenzie, 1966 and C. edwardi McKenzie, 1978. The morphological variability in carapace shape and uniformity of the internal morphology of the species Bennelongia australis s. l.

40|$|A multivariate {{approach}} {{has been used to}} study morphological variation in the blue and orange-form species of rock crab of the genus Leptograpsus.

The first canonical variate, which differentiates between the two species, represents a contrast between the carapace width relative to the width of the front lip and the depth of the body; the blue-form species has a greater relative carapace width than has the orange form. The second canonical variate, which presents a contrast between the rear width and the carapace length, identifies males and females within each species; males have a greater relative carapace length than have females. All individuals, including 20 not used in the study, were correctly identified for colour form. The clear separation of the blue and orange forms achieved by canonical analysis supports the previously determined specific status of the two forms...|$|E
