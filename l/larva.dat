5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a <b>larva</b> is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the <b>larva</b> makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the <b>larva</b> metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the <b>larva</b> are hollow and through this, the <b>larva</b> sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The <b>larva</b> readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E
5|$|Super Metroid {{opens with}} a {{narrative}} by bounty hunter Samus Aran. Samus describes the events of her , and how she encountered a Metroid <b>larva,</b> which hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her to be its mother. She brought the <b>larva</b> to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the <b>larva</b> stolen by Ridley—the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the space colony when its self-destruct sequence is activated, and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. There, she searches for the stolen <b>larva</b> in a network of caves, and finds that the Space Pirates rebuilt and expanded their base on Zebes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>larvae</b> of sawflies {{are easily}} mistaken for {{lepidopteran}} <b>larvae</b> (caterpillars). However, several morphological differences can distinguish the two: while both <b>larvae</b> share {{three pairs of}} thoracic legs and an apical pair of abdominal prolegs, lepidopteran caterpillars have four pairs of prolegs on abdominal segments 3-6 while sawfly <b>larvae</b> have five pairs of prolegs located on abdominal segments 2-6; crochets are present on lepidopteran <b>larvae,</b> whereas on sawfly <b>larvae</b> they are not; the prolegs of both <b>larvae</b> gradually disappear {{by the time they}} burrow into the ground, therefore making it difficult to distinguish the two; and sawfly <b>larvae</b> only have a single pair of minute eyes, whereas lepidopteran <b>larvae</b> have four to six eyes {{on each side of the}} head. Sawfly <b>larvae</b> behave like lepidopteran <b>larvae,</b> walking about and eating foliage. Some groups have <b>larvae</b> that are eyeless and almost legless; these <b>larvae</b> make tunnels in plant tissues including wood. Many species of sawfly <b>larvae</b> are strikingly coloured, exhibiting colour combinations such as black and white while others are black and yellow. This is a warning colouration because some <b>larvae</b> can secrete irritating fluids from glands located on their undersides.|$|R
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the <b>larva</b> or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated <b>larva</b> can be used.|$|E

5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The <b>larva</b> of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion <b>larva</b> by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E
40|$|During April, May, and June 1971 several surveys {{for fish}} <b>larvae</b> {{were carried out}} in {{northern}} Norwegian coastal waters.

40|$|Chaoborus americanus <b>larvae</b> {{were used}} in {{laboratory}} experiments to assess their efficiency at decreasing mosquito larval populations. Third and fourth instar Chaoborus americanus <b>larvae</b> were independently fed assemblages of single prey species to test hunger and several prey species to test preference. Prey species included Daphnia and the four Aedes aegypti larval instars. The results show that Chaoborus americanus <b>larvae</b> will choose early instar mosquito <b>larvae</b> over Daphnia, however, this preference decreases as the mosquito <b>larvae</b> become older. Third instar Chaoborus americanus <b>larvae</b> will choose first instar mosquito <b>larvae</b> over Daphnia 76 % of the time, whereas they will select third instar mosquito <b>larvae</b> only 30 % of the time. Fourth instar Chaoborus americanus <b>larvae</b> will choose first instar mosquito <b>larvae</b> 94 % of the time, and select fourth instar mosquito <b>larvae</b> only 3 % of the time.

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read as}} showing either the forelegs of the <b>larva,</b> or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the <b>larva</b> as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the <b>larva,</b> and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the <b>larva</b> grows, more material is added at the front, and the <b>larva</b> can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of many {{hoverfly}} species principally {{feed upon}} aphids, one <b>larva</b> devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their effectiveness in commercial crops {{has not been}} studied.|$|E
5|$|Beetle <b>larvae</b> can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect <b>larvae</b> by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the <b>larvae</b> are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile <b>larvae</b> include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their <b>larvae</b> are described as campodeiform. Some beetle <b>larvae</b> resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform <b>larvae,</b> and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform <b>larvae</b> of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick <b>larvae</b> described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|R

5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a <b>larva</b> senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single <b>larva</b> to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the <b>larva</b> of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid <b>larva</b> – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate <b>larva,</b> which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny <b>larva</b> specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{difficulties}} faced by <b>larvae</b> is the threat of predation. <b>Larvae</b> are small and plentiful, so many animals {{take advantage of this}} food source. The situation is particularly dangerous for invertebrate <b>larvae</b> in estuaries; estuaries are nursery grounds for planktivorous fishes. Estuarine species’ <b>larvae</b> have evolved strategies to cope with this threat, including methods such as direct defense and avoidance.Direct defense is usually only evident in species in which larval development takes place entirely within the estuary. Studies have shown that <b>larvae</b> that do not leave estuaries are larger than <b>larvae</b> that develop in the open ocean. Additionally, many estuarine <b>larvae</b> have large spines and other protective structures. These defenses work because most planktivorous fishes are gape-limited predators—what they eat is determined by how wide they can open their mouths—so larger <b>larvae</b> are harder for them to ingest. Morgan showed that spines do indeed serve a protective function by cutting off spines of some estuarine crab <b>larvae</b> and monitoring differences in predation rates between despined and intact <b>larvae.</b> Despined <b>larvae</b> suffered significantly higher predation rates than intact <b>larvae,</b> and were preferentially chosen during feeding trials with both types of <b>larvae</b> present. Additionally, Morgan showed that large-spined estuarine <b>larvae</b> usually keep their lateral spines relaxed, but raise them when approached by a predator. Therefore, predator deterrence in estuarine <b>larvae</b> is not only morphological but also behavioral.|$|R

5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the <b>larva,</b> the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the <b>larva</b> towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, usually at the larval stage. The {{mealworm}} (the <b>larva</b> of the darkling beetle) and the rhinoceros beetle are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the <b>larva</b> undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the <b>larva</b> moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>larvae</b> feed on Pyrrosia eleagnifolia, mining the leaves. Young <b>larvae</b> {{create a}} number of mines {{radiating}} from the base. Older <b>larvae</b> create a large blotch mine. Full-grown <b>larvae</b> reach a length of 12-14 mm.|$|R
