500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} by reporters, Cowell said, [...] "There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> will eventually clear {{up when the}} time is right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here." [...] The Silvermans released separate statements expressing concern for the well-being of their son during the divorce process. In August 2013, the Silvermans settled their divorce out of court, enabling Cowell to avoid being called as a witness in the divorce proceedings. Cowell subsequently confirmed that Silverman was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to baby Eric on 14 February 2014.|$|E

"We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way. I thought I was doing the right thing by changing things, but it didn’t work... Nowadays I would’ve had a shoulder operation... I got told I could have one, but it was really up to me to organise.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 November 2014 Cleverly and Tony Bellew {{had their}} rematch, {{this time they}} were both {{fighting}} as cruiserweights. The fight {{took place at the}} Echo Arena in Liverpool. This was also a WBO cruiserweight title eliminator. The title was held by Marco Huck at the time. The bout went 12 rounds as Bellew won via split decision (115-113, 116-112 & 114-115). In the post-fight interview, Bellew said, [...] "I’m over the moon, listen it’s over, it’s put to bed. We said a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> don’t like him now, but it’s been settled tonight. It’s over, it’s done and I've outworked a great athlete." [...] He also stated that he would do a rubber match at Millennium Stadium if there was any demand for it. Cleverly said he struggled with dealing with Bellew at a higher weight.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as {{the results}} of the March 9, 2008 {{primaries}} were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying [...] "Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party. You will not see me ever again involved in active politics, party reunions or party meetings, as I now plan to become a private citizen. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I have to do to help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E
2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and when I saw that book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unsolicited}} screenplay {{was written}} by two novice writers, actor Gregory Fleeman and documentarian Robert T. Megginson. Producer Jack Wiener read their script, which was submitted as a low-budget television movie, and felt {{that it should be}} made into a theatrical release. Wiener and his co-producer Dodi Fayed hired Robert Mandel, an Off-Broadway director. They did not want to hire an action director, but instead wanted a director who would bring a realistic touch to the film and make the audience care about the main character. Mandel accepted the job because he wanted to dispel the perception that he was a [...] "soft, arty director". Initially he was not impressed with the film's screenplay, which he felt was not well-crafted but felt that it provided for [...] "a lot of action and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did not have under my belt". In preparation for the film's action sequences, Mandel studied chase scenes from Bullitt and The French Connection. To pull off the film's special effects, the producers hired John Stears, who had worked on the first eight James Bond films and shared a special effects Academy Award for [...]|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...

2500|$|In {{addition}} to both coaches, three starters from the 1941–42 team had departed for {{service in the}} war. Accordingly, expectations for the 1942–43 Longhorns were low. Despite losses of coaches and players that were projected as insurmountable hardships, Texas defied expectations, winning 13 of its first 16 games. Gilstrap credited Gray and Price with encouragement and advice from afar and his players {{with a degree of}} cooperation he said he had not seen before. Gilstrap explained, [...] "There were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> didn't know about the system, and the boys realized that. They came to the rescue. They've been assistant coaches as well as players. We've just been trying to work it out together." [...] After stumbling on a swing through North Texas late in the season with losses to TCU and SMU, the Longhorns concluded the regular season with victories over the Baylor Bears and Texas A to win a share of the SWC championship and qualify for the NCAA Tournament for the second time. The Longhorns drew the Tournament co-favorite Washington Huskies for their first game. After falling behind by 13 points in the first half, Texas came back to win 59–55 behind 30 points from John Hargis and 15 from Buck Overall to advance to its first-ever Final Four, where it drew the other Tournament co-favorite, the Wyoming Cowboys. It was then the Longhorns who surrendered an early 13-point lead, as the bigger and stronger Cowboys regrouped to win 58–54, on their way to defeating the Georgetown Hoyas 46–34 for the NCAA championship. Texas finished the season with a 19–7 overall record.|$|E
2500|$|Pippen {{claimed the}} {{starting}} small forward {{position with the}} Portland Trail Blazers in the 1999–2000 NBA season. Playing alongside new stars such as Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith, Pippen continued to demonstrate his defensive capabilities, even past his prime. On January 3, when the Trail Blazers faced the Bulls, Pippen was honored with a video tribute highlighting his best moments in his 11-year career with the Bulls. Pippen later commented on the tribute by saying: [...] "It was very emotional for me, but I tried to handle {{it as well as}} possible realizing I had a game to play. It was something that brought back a lot of memories for me, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> miss about this city, playing in this arena." [...] Under Head coach Mike Dunleavy, the Trail Blazers posted a 59–23 record and clinched the second spot in the Pacific Division and the third spot in the Western Conference. Pippen played and started in all 82 games that season, averaging 12.5 points per game, 5 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. In {{the first round of the}} 2000 NBA Playoffs, Portland defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3 games to 1. Their opponents in the second round were the Utah Jazz. In Game 5, while leading the series 3–1, with 12.6 seconds remaining and Portland trailing by 2, Pippen inbounded the ball to Damon Stoudamire who returned it to Pippen, who hit a three pointer with 7.3 seconds remaining. The Jazz fouled Pippen on the next play, and he stepped to the line and made one of two free throws to give the Blazers a 81–79 lead. Bryon Russell of the Jazz attempted a game-winning three-pointer but threw the shot off balance, which resulted in an air ball. The Trail Blazers won the series 4–1 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals. There they faced the Los Angeles Lakers, coached under Phil Jackson, Pippen's former coach in Chicago. The series was stretched to a deciding Game 7, in which the Trail Blazers held a 15-point lead in the 4th quarter. However, led by the All-Star duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers managed to erase Portland's lead and win the game 89–84 and with that also the series. The Lakers proceeded to the 2000 NBA Finals where they faced the Indiana Pacers and were eventually crowned the NBA Champions.|$|E
