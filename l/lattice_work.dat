5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf <b>lattice</b> <b>work</b> gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E

40|$|The spacing {{between the}} thick myofilaments of muscle fibers from the walking legs of {{crayfish}} (Orconectes) {{was determined by}} optical transform analysis of electron micrograph plates of fixed single fibers and by X-ray diffraction of living single fibers. Sarcomere lengths were determined by light diffraction prior to fixation and prior to the in vivo experiments. From these combined measurements, it is demonstrated that the unit-cell volume of the myofilament lattice is constant during muscle shortening, indicating that the myofilament <b>lattice</b> <b>works</b> in a constant-volume manner. It is further demonstrated with X-ray diffraction measurements of living single fibers that the myofilament <b>lattice</b> continues to <b>work</b> at constant volume after the sarcolemma {{is removed from the}} fiber. This indicates that the constant-volume behavior of muscle is inherent to the myofilament lattice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a way to}} perform realistic three-dimensional texturing of ray-traced objects with irregular surfaces. Such texturing {{has been done in}} the past with texture mapping, particle systems, or volumetric methods. We propose an alternative to these called a <b>lattice.</b> <b>Lattices</b> <b>work</b> as fast but inexact ray tracers. As long as lattices are used for small objects, though, the inexactness doesn’t show on the scale of the display, and the result is acceptable. The paper shows how lattices can be integrated with a more traditional ray tracer, with several examples. Time and memory space considerations are major constraints on lattices, preventing widespread practical application at the present time. The paper discusses these limitations and how they might be reduced. ...|$|R

The mechanism of the carding machine {{is powered by a}} small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between each layer, a new lattice of thread is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer.|$|E
25|$|John W. and Silas S. Fallas settled here in 1837, {{founded a}} village which soon boasted a chair factory, sawmill, and gristmill. About 1840 {{the first of}} several wooden bridges was placed across the Flat River, but all succumbed in a short time to high water and massive spring ice jams. Bridge builder Jared N.

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} new {{technique}} {{for the detection of}} single atoms in ultracold quantum gases. The technique is based on scanning electron microscopy and employs the electron impact ionization of trapped atoms with a focussed electron probe. Subsequent detection of the resulting ions allows for the reconstruction of the atoms position. This technique is expected to achieve a much better spatial resolution compared to any optical detection method. In combination with the sensitivity to single atoms, it makes new in situ measurements of atomic correlations possible. The detection principle is also well suited for the addressing of individual sites in optical <b>lattices.</b> <b>Working</b> principle of the electron microscope: A focussed electron beam is directed onto the ultracold atoms.

25|$|The next {{rooms are}} the Baths of the Sultan and the Queen Mother (Hünkâr ve Vâlide Hamamları). This double bath {{dates from the}} late 16th century and {{consists}} of multiple rooms. It was redecorated in the rococo style {{in the middle of}} the 18th century. Both baths present the same design, consisting of a caldarium, a tepidarium and a frigidarium. Each room either has a dome, or the ceilings are at some point glassed in a honeycomb structure to let the natural sunlight in. The floor is clad in white and grey marble. The marble tub with an ornamental fountain in the caldarium and the gilded iron grill are characteristic features. The golden <b>lattice</b> <b>work</b> was to protect the bathing sultan or his mother from murder attempts. The sultan's bath was decorated by Sinan with high-quality İznik polychrome tiles. But much of the tile decoration of the harem, from structures damaged by the fire of 1574, was recycled by Sultan Ahmed I for decoration in his new Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul. The walls are now either clad in marble or white-washed.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetrical}} {{and simple}} designed {{on the exterior}} is in sharp contrast with the complex interior floor plan, of inner chambers, which is a square 'ninefold plan', where eight two-storyed vaulted chambers radiate from the central, double-height domed chamber. It can be entered through an imposing entrance iwan (high arc) on the south, which is slightly recessed, while others sides are covered with intricate jaalis, stone <b>lattice</b> <b>work.</b> Underneath this white dome in a domed chamber (hujra), lies the central octagonal sepulcher, the burial chamber containing a single cenotaph, that of the second Mughal Emperor, Humayun aligned on the north-south axis, as per Islamic tradition, where in the head is placed to the north, while the face is turned sideways towards Mecca. The real burial chamber of the Emperor, however lies further away in an underground chamber, exactly beneath the upper cenotaph, accessible through a separate passage outside the main structure, which remains mostly closed to visiting public. This burial technique along with pietra dura, a marble and even stone inlay ornamentation in numerous geometrical and arabesque patterns, seen all around the facade is an important legacy of the Indo-Islamic architecture, and flourished in many later mausolea of the Mughal Empire, like the Taj Mahal, where again we find twin cenotaphs and exquisite 'pietra dura' craftsmanship.|$|E

40|$|AbstractJ. Kahn and J. Kung {{showed how}} to {{reconstruct}} the group of a Dowling lattice. Here we show how to obtain the group of a Dowling lattice through techniques parallel to those used in classical geometry to obtain the field when coordinatizing a projective or affine space. The analogy between Dowling lattices and classical geometry goes deeper. From an axiomatization of Dowling lattices of rank four and greater, first investigated in [J. Bonin and K. Bogart, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 56 (1991), 195 - 202], we derive the restriction of Desargues′ theorem to coordinate lines. In rank three, the construction used to define Dowling <b>lattices</b> <b>works</b> just as well for quasigroups as for groups. The planar bundle theorem, which for rank four and greater is a corollary of Desargues′ theorem, distinguishes between the rank-three lattices based on groups and those based on quasigroups. Moreover, Pappus′ theorem, restricted to coordinate lines, characterizes the Dowling lattices based on abelian groups...|$|R
500|$|One of {{the largest}} {{decorative}} marble remains of the site is the niche-head pieces. These massive pieces of marble consist of a concave segment with a large frontal peacock carved in the center, tail fanned out proud. The epigram runs along the semicircle of the carving. Surrounding the peacocks are the spandrels filled with grape vines and leaves. The inscription's letters are raised 11cm high, and surrounded by realistic grape vines. The detail involved in every individual leaf is remarkable. Each leaf has visible veins, some edges of the leaves are frayed and torn, and the artist even {{took the time to}} layer the design, pulling some leaves forward, and carving others in the background, giving the sense of depth. Martin Harrison notes that this workmanship is all done by the artist’s eye, and with no use of a constant measure, as indicated by the marks made by the chisel, minute irregularities, and slight bends in the <b>lattice</b> <b>work.</b> This area was originally painted [...] in vibrant colors. The primary colors used were blues, greens, and some purples. These colors are difficult to find or make and show Anicia Juliana’s power in the decorative aspect of the structure. The background to vines and letters was a bright blue. The peacocks—associated with the goddess Hera and royalty in Antiquity and symbolizing renewal and rebirth for Christians —adorned with carved necklaces, were painted in blues, greens and gold. Due to the empty cavities {{in the eyes of the}} remaining bird head pieces, green glass was used for the pupils. They also held chains to suspend something. Connor suggests due to their location, a lamp is a believable use for the chains in their beaks.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew's {{objections}} {{were not}} heeded, {{and were not}} persisted in once Parliament had passed the Bill authorising construction of the Tay Bridge. [...] During construction of the bridge some of Matthew's criticisms were borne out: {{it became apparent that}} bedrock could not be found at a depth allowing the use of brick piers; the design had to be modified to use lattice-work iron piers of reduced width, and there was considerable cost overrun. The [...] bridge opened in June 1878 and was destroyed in a storm in December 1879: the <b>lattice</b> <b>work</b> piers supporting the centre section of the bridge (the high girders) failed catastrophically as a train was crossing the bridge. [...] The high girders and the train fell into the Tay and about seventy-five lives were lost. Whilst it was recalled {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the disaster that Matthew had predicted collapse in a high wind as one of the horrible ends to which a bridge at Dundee could come, the disaster is generally ascribed to defects in the design and manufacture of the <b>lattice</b> <b>work</b> piers introduced into the design well after Matthew's campaign against the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|It {{would be}} kept either in the sacristy or in the church itself in a pyx hanging over the altar, an aumbry – a safe in {{the wall of the}} church – or in a {{tabernacle}} – literally a tent, but in fact a metal safe on or immediately behind the altar itself, sometimes covered with a seasonally coloured cloth. [...] Caskets {{in the form of a}} dove or of a tower, made for the most part of one of the precious metals, were commonly used for the purpose, but whether in the early Middle Ages these Eucharistic vessels were kept over the altar, or elsewhere in the church, or in the sacristy, does not clearly appear. After the 10th century the commonest usage in England and France seems to have been to suspend the Blessed Sacrament in a dove-shaped vessel by a cord over the high altar. Fixed and locked tabernacles were known and indeed prescribed by the regulations of Bishop Quivil of Exeter at the end of the 13th century, though in England they never came into general use before the Reformation. In Germany, in the 14th and 15th centuries, a custom widely prevailed of enshrining the Eucharist in a [...] "sacrament house", often beautifully decorated, separate from the high altar but only a short distance away from it, and on the north or Gospel side of the Church. This custom seems to have originated in the desire to allow the Blessed Sacrament to be seen by the faithful without exactly contravening the synodal decrees which forbade any continuous exposition. In the sacrament house, the door was invariably made of metal <b>lattice</b> <b>work,</b> through which the vessel containing the sacred species could be discerned at least obscurely.|$|E

2500|$|Significant {{differences}} {{in the construction of}} the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards [...] "seem without exception to have [...] either iron strips or protective mail curtains." [...] The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of [...] "a differing version well forward on the face" [...] of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though [...] "difficult to reconstruct," [...] fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips, while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with [...] "elaborate" [...] Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of <b>lattice</b> <b>work</b> and a triangular plate.|$|E
