40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} diagnosis of railway arrester considering uncertainty. Arresters, a protective device that prevents damage due to transient voltages, deteriorate due to the absorption of moisture, repetitive operation during over-voltages and manufacturing defects. Various diagnostic techniques are available for monitoring deterioration of arresters. The technique based on the amplitude of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> measures the root mean square or peak values of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components. After measuring the total <b>leakage</b> <b>current,</b> harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components are analyzed by using a microprocessor based device. The level of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> {{is indicative of the}} arrester conditions. Harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components occur due to nonlinear characteristics of railway arrester. Since <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> contains uncertainty characteristics of power source, the probability density functions of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components can be obtained for ZnO arrester. This paper {{presents a}} probabilistic approximation method for the harmonic currents analysis in diagnosis for railway arresters. Mean and variance of harmonic currents in railway system are obtained based on <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components. These statistical measures can be helpful to reduce the diagnostic error for railway arrester...|$|R

30|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} {{value for the}} <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> density seems to involve a lot of discrepancies. In the above calculation, we have the constant value of 6.7 mA/m. Some unpublished information indicates <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> densities of 20 mA/ 1000 feet ≈ 0.067 mA/m, i.e. a difference of a factor of 100.

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
