5000|$|Black Steve (voiced by Tony Strickland) — Black Steve is GameaVision's {{accountant}} and, as {{his nickname}} would imply, {{he is the}} only black person working at the company. He is foul-mouthed, ill-tempered and racist against white people. Despite his position, Black Steve has contributed games to the company, mostly themed to his prejudice <b>towards</b> <b>white</b> people. And, he is apparently fluent in Japanese and conversational Arabic. He is also a former pro wrestler known as [...] "The Black Shadow" [...] as well as graduate of Dartmouth. Though bigoted <b>towards</b> <b>whites,</b> Black Steve does coexist with his co-workers and even has garnered Larrity's respect due to his violent temper and love of guns.|$|R

50|$|Clarity is a {{tendency}} <b>towards</b> <b>white,</b> and obscurity is {{a tendency}} <b>towards</b> black. <b>White</b> and black form the second great contrast, which is static. White is a deep, absolute silence, full of possibility. Black is nothingness without possibility, an eternal silence without hope, and corresponds with death. Any other colour resonates strongly on its neighbors. The mixing of white with black leads to gray, which possesses no active force and whose tonality is near that of green. Gray corresponds to immobility without hope; it tends to despair when it becomes dark, regaining little hope when it lightens.|$|R

50|$|However, as n increases, {{the ratio}} still tends in the <b>limit</b> <b>towards</b> the same {{constant}} 1/2. The ratio test generalizes the simple test for geometric series to more complex series {{like this one}} where the quotient of two terms is not fixed, but in the <b>limit</b> tends <b>towards</b> a fixed value. The rules are similar: if the quotient approaches a value less than one, the series converges, whereas if it approaches a value greater than one, the series diverges.|$|R
