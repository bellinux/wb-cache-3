5000|$|In February 1850 matters {{came to a}} head; two bank {{debentures}} totally £245,000 {{were due}} for repayment, as well as considerable arrears of <b>lease</b> <b>charges</b> to the Wishaw and Coltness and others.

50|$|The GPK&AR {{desired to}} {{consolidate}} their routes in the area, {{and they took}} a lease of the K&TR; this was effective from 16 July 1846. On 1 March 1847 the GPK&AR opened a connecting line at Kilmarnock to its station, swinging north from a junction at St Marnock's. At {{the same time that}} company opened passenger stations at Gatehead and Drybridge. The K&TR Company continued to exist, receiving the <b>lease</b> <b>charges,</b> until on 16 July 1899 the line was bought by the GPK&A's successor, the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway Company was wound up in 1902; all the proprietors received their share value and a bonus of 25 s, and a 12½% dividend.|$|E
50|$|In 1841 the Dundee and Newtyle {{had taken}} a lease of the Coupar Angus line, but they found that they were quite unable to pay the <b>lease</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|R
50|$|After lengthy discussions, the SMJR {{agreed to}} lease its {{line to the}} Scottish Central Railway by {{decision}} of 18 February 1847; the <b>lease</b> <b>charge</b> was to be 6% on the SMJR capital of £600,000.|$|R
50|$|The company {{continued}} to trade, {{and it was}} making a modest, but declining, operating profit.

50|$|Even before {{authorisation}} the Caledonian had {{strategic plans}} to control these, and other, lines, forming a widespread Caledonian area {{of control in}} Scotland. As its capital would all be required to build its railway, it was unable to purchase the lines; instead it agreed leases of the other (as yet unauthorised) companies; this required no cash down payment, but a heavy commitment to periodical <b>lease</b> <b>charges</b> later. In due course, the Caledonian was to find that these payments were unaffordable, and {{it was able to}} escape them by demonstrating that they were ultra vires, that is, that their company had no powers to make such commitments. Moreover, Parliament was at times hostile to large combinations of lines, and declined to assent to some amalgamations.|$|E

50|$|From 2010 to 2015, the Michigan Department of Transportation {{refurbished}} and leased 1950's-1960's retired Metra {{rail cars}} {{in anticipation of}} WALLY, which still had not received any approval or capital or operational funding. Over the five-year period, the passenger rail cars sat unused in a railyard owned by Great Lakes Central Railroad in Owosso, northeast of Lansing. The state paid over $12 million lease the passenger rail cars, spending $7.3 million in refurbishments, $3 million in <b>lease</b> <b>charges,</b> and another $1.1 million for consulting. Public outcry led to the termination of the lease which had continued to cost the state $1.1 million annually. The terms of the new agreement allowed Grand Lakes Central to lease the rail cars to other entities, but the cars would be made available upon request to MDOT {{for the next five}} years. In addition, 50-70% of the lease or sale revenue from the rail cars would be returned to the state.|$|E
50|$|In 1842 {{the company}} changed to horse {{traction}} as an economy measure, much business having been lost by {{then to the}} GP&GR. The company had never made a profit and the line was leased out, presumably to a private contractor. In 1846 the <b>lease</b> <b>charge</b> was £700 a year.|$|R
50|$|Only now {{during the}} 1845 Parliamentary session, did it emerge that the trunk {{railways}} {{would be made}} to the standard gauge; the A&FR and the D&AR would have to alter their gauge to suit, and moreover to provide double track. The cost of the A&FR part of that work was estimated to be £43,600: money that the A&FR could not hope to raise. The solution was to lease the line to the Aberdeen Railway and allow it to carry out the works. This was agreed and a <b>lease</b> <b>charge</b> of 5.25% on the capital value of the converted A&FR line was agreed; in addition 50% of any operating profit (after payment of the <b>lease</b> <b>charge)</b> would come to the A&FR. The effective date was to be 1 February 1848.|$|R
50|$|North of the Campsie Fells the {{independent}} Forth and Clyde Junction Railway opened in 1856 from Balloch to Stirling, passing through largely agricultural terrain.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and simulates {{a dynamic}} model of strategic telecom competition. The {{goal is to}} understand how regulatory policy, particularly relative to <b>lease</b> <b>charges</b> for local network elements, affects telecom competition, investment, retail prices, and consumer welfare. The model assumes two products, local voice service and data (broadband), and three types of players the regional Bell operating companies, referred to as incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), cable companies (Cables), and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). The game begins with a) ILECs established in each county {{with respect to the}} provision of local voice and data services and b) Cables established in roughly half of the counties with respect to the provision of data. There are one-time fixed costs of entering a county, product- and period-specific costs of operating in a county, and marginal costs of supplying each product. Economies of scope reduce the fixed entry and operating costs of supplying both products in a given county at a given point in time. Finally, in supplying telecom services in a given county, CLECs may enter by leasing ILEC infrastructure at specified access rates. The requirement that ILECs allow CLECs to lease their local network facilities was established in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as part of a quid pro quo that promised ILECs entry into the long distance market. But the ILECs continue to contest the quid. The ILECs support their position by suggesting that leased access reduces telecom investment and output and raises telecom prices. Our model considers the entire range of options available to each of the players, but it reaches the opposite conclusion. Indeed, we find thatif UNE-P rates were set at the Supreme Court-approved total element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) levels, telecom investment and employment outlays would increase by over one fifth in counties containing the majority of the U. S. population and by over 30 percent in counties containing almost a third of the population. The present value of telecom outlays over the next 5 and 20 years would rise by $ 71 billion and $ 155 billion, respectively. On average, the switch from actual to TELRIC UNE rates would lower local phone rates across the country's 3108 counties by $ 57 per year, generating annual total savings to consumers of $ 15 billion. Almost two fifths of the population would experience reductions in local phone rates of 20 percent or more. Over one fifth would experience rate reductions of 30 percent or more. These findings of price reductions are based on a fairly conservative parameterization of our model with respect to the specification of true ILEC and CLEC incremental long-run production costs. ...|$|E

50|$|The lease {{agreement}} of the Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Railway Junction was repudiated, {{on the basis that}} it was illegal.

50|$|The Caledonian Railway was {{naturally}} {{the most}} significant railway in this spate of authorisations, and even before its Act of Parliament it saw its destiny as controlling large tracts of Scotland; but with no cash to spend, it set about concluding agreements with the other (as yet unauthorised) lines to lease them.

50|$|The only branch {{that was}} built by the E&BR was to Uphall, and from there a mineral railway {{extension}} ran to the Binny Quarry, near Ecclesmachen. The main line to Bathgate was opened on 12 November 1849. The company had been encouraged by the E&GR, and the E&BR leased its line to the E&GR for 999 years from the date of opening. The <b>lease</b> <b>charge</b> was 4% of the capital cost of the line plus a proportion of receipts.|$|R
50|$|From {{this time}} the Swansea Vale Railway Company was only a {{financial}} entity, receiving the <b>lease</b> <b>charge.</b> Nevertheless considerable capital expenditure was now being undertaken by the Midland Railway on bringing the SVR track and structures up to date, and this complicated the financial relationship.

50|$|The South Wales Mineral Railway {{had been}} worked by the Great Western Railway since 1908, {{so that the}} company itself was merely a {{financial}} entity. Its issued capital was stated to be £250,000, and its income for the year 1921 was £2,744, no doubt simply a <b>lease</b> <b>charge.</b> Its route length was declared to be 13 miles, and five locomotives were {{handed over to the}} new Great Western Railway.

50|$|From 1877, the CMR was a {{financial}} vehicle only, all the day-to-day {{operation of the}} railway now being {{in the hands of}} the GWR.

40|$|This study {{takes into}} {{consideration}} the issue of leasing as a specific form o f financing investment, which can be an alternative to a traditional bank credit. The author begins this article with some comments on the matter and kinds o f leasing and some ways how to calculate the <b>leasing</b> <b>charge.</b> Then, the authors focus on the comparison between leasing and bank credit. The comparative analysis of leasing and bank credit takes into consideration only the comparison between <b>leasing</b> <b>charges</b> (costs), generated flows and the costs o f credit and connected with them flows. However, this analysis leaves out other aspects such as possibilities o f using leasing and credit, {{the influence of a}} form of financing on the company’s situation, advantages connected with purchasing goods that had been used before on attractive conditions within the limits o f a leasing contract, etc. The issues presented in this study clarify the costs o f leasing and cash flow generated by leasing. The problems considered in this article: leasing as an alternative form o f financing investment (alternative to credit) give an opportunity to look more critically at the choice of source of financing company’s investment projects.

50|$|In 1845 {{there was}} a frenzy of railway {{promotion}} in Scotland, and the Caledonian Railway, among many others, was authorised by Act of Parliament; its capitalisation was £1,500,000, to build a line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle, linking there with English railways. Well before its Act, the Caledonian had set about capturing as many other railways, whether completed or still only proposals, as it could. It did so by concluding leases of those lines; the advantage of that was that the <b>lease</b> <b>charge</b> payments only became due later, and were annual percentages: no large front-end payment was necessary.|$|R
50|$|The cost of {{construction}} of the Liskeard extension had overrun very considerably, and Spicer footed the escalating bill. Despite the relative profitability of the L&LR it was unable to pay interest charges consistently, and paradoxically it now failed to pay the L&CR <b>lease</b> <b>charge,</b> and the L&CR receiver took action against the L&LR. Hopelessly unable to pay off its huge debts, the company looked for a purchaser in the Great Western Railway (GWR). The GWR was anxious to keep the rival London and South Western Railway out of the area, and agreed to purchase the L&CR.|$|R
