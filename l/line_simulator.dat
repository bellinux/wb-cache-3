The objective of the work described here was to compare on a laboratory scale different types of impact acceleration recording electronic fruits: Mikras implanted in a real potato tuber {{as well as in}} a dummy tuber, IRD, Smart Spud and TuberLog. The acquisition of mechanical impacts was performed using a drop simulator with optional steel or PVC as impact material as well as a processing <b>line</b> <b>simulator.</b> Our results show that drops from 10 cm height on PVC caused similar peak accelerations of Mikras implanted in a real potato or a dummy, IRD and TuberLog. When dropped onto steel however, IRD, TuberLog and Mikras implanted in a dummy recorded higher peak values than Mikras in real potatoes. Impact on the flat side of a tuber led to higher peak values than impact on the apical region. This could be caused by different elastic compliance of synthetic materials as well as material thickness. Running through the processing <b>line</b> <b>simulator</b> TuberLog recorded the most impact; Smart Spud recorded a low number of impacts compared to the other electronic fruits.

40|$|As the {{semiconductor}} industry is moving towards achieving smaller, denser and faster integrated circuits; the issue of contamination control is becoming increasingly important. The current work focuses on the mechanism and kinetics of removal of adsorbed moisture and organics from surfaces and nanostructures. In the first application of this study, a novel approach to the characterization of dynamic interactions of gases with solid surfaces is developed. A model is developed to represent the simultaneous adsorption and desorption processes in these systems. The model can simulate both the non-equilibrium adsorption and desorption processes {{as well as the}} equilibrium state (isotherms and isobars). The model is validated using experimental data, and applied to the adsorption of moisture on oxides (ZrO 2 and HfO 2). Practical application of this work is shown by optimizing the purge recipes for removal of moisture from a ZrO 2 film. In the second application, a novel approach is developed and demonstrated to characterize the sampling line effects during dynamic monitoring of fluid concentrations. The "Sampling line" in this study refers to all components between the point of fluid sampling and the point of analyzer sensor. In general, sampling lines introduce errors in measurements by altering the sample properties due to the fluid transport in the line as well as the adsorption and desorption of fluid constituents on the surfaces of the sampling components that come in contact with the sample fluid. A methodology based on a sampling <b>line</b> <b>simulator</b> is developed for taking these effects into account and correcting the measurements. The sampling <b>line</b> <b>simulator</b> can be used to analyze the effect of various sampling configurations and operating conditions. In the last application, experiments were carried out to study the interaction of organics with micro/nano particles representing nanostructures. A process model is developed which gives insight about the mechanism and kinetics of these interactions. The micro/nano particles, due to their large surface area, can adsorb any other species which may result in the change in their properties. This may ultimately affect the process in which they exist.

40|$|A {{temporary}} overvoltage is an oscillatory {{phase to ground}} or phase to phase over voltage that is relatively long duration and is undamped or only weakly damped. Temporary over voltages usually originate from faults, sudden charge of load, Ferranti effect, linear resonance, ferroresonance, open conductor, induced resonance from coupled circuits and so forth.

Hence, the medium carrying high frequency signals is lossy silicon (Si). Wave propagation through vertical interconnects in Si media {{has not been}} necessary before, except for the Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) planar microstriplines on RFICs. Hence, fundamental understanding of wave propagation through TSVs is lacking for successful implementation of 3 D IC integration technology {{as well as for}} the development of Si interposers at RF/microwave frequencies. The focus of this research is characterization and modeling of TSVs and Si to explore high speed signal propagation through the lossy Si medium. Previously, there were various opinions on the physical interpretations of the extracted RLC parameters of TSVs. The TSV capacitance, for example, is sometimes considered to be predominantly a sidewall capacitance, whereas in other works it is deemed more appropriate that the electric field lines should terminate on a ground plane below the TSV. Indeed, the capacitance changes as a function of frequency because of the slow-wave mode. To understand better the physical significance of the TSV, we will establish a framework for wave propagation through TSVs based on dielectric quasi-TEM, skin effect, and slow-wave modes similar to MIS micro-strip lines. For validation of the existence of these modes, full wave simulation results will be compared with simpler two dimensional transmission <b>line</b> <b>simulators.</b> The following topics will be discussed in this thesis: 1. Verification of the wave propagation modes in TSVs. 2. Development of equivalent circuit models for TSVs. 3. Comparative study of different TSV configuration...|$|R

40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} simulation of lossy, multi-conductor transmission lines that are terminated by nonlinear circuits {{is necessary to}} design high-performance electronic circuits and packages. In this work, theoretical and practical considerations of lossy line simulation are presented. Using delay differential equations, the class of systems with "bidirectional delay" is introduced. These systems can be partitioned such that the resulting subsystems are only linked via delayed variables. It is stated in the "decoupling theorem" that the subsystems can be solved independently for a time interval, which is not longer than the shortest time delay. Circuits that contain transmission lines are shown to form systems with bidirectional delay and, consequently, can be decoupled. Using concepts derived from waveform relaxation, the decoupling is exploited to reduce the computational effort required for transmission line simulation. Moreover, an efficient method for the approximation of lossy line characteristics by rational transfer functions is presented. The method employs nonlinear minimization techniques and yields function coefficients suitable for time-domain modeling. Furthermore, the exponential wave propagation function is represented in the time domain, and discrete-time convolution is employed to calculate the transmission line response. Also described is a filtering method which considerably improves {{the stability of the}} simulation, while the deviation in the simulation results is smaller than the local truncation error. In addition, implementation of the lossy <b>line</b> <b>simulator</b> "UAFLICS" is outlined, and practical applications demonstrate the significance of coupling and loss effects...|$|E
