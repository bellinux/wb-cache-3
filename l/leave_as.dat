5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E

Daenerys asks Moro to escort her back to Meereen, but he refuses to let her <b>leave,</b> <b>as</b> widows of Khals must live out their lives in Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki's sacred city.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she lets}} them outside again, but this time, Russetfur walks in on them.

Later on, Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken {{because they want to}} make their mother happy.|$|E

He joined Capcom and for 20 years was involved in titles such as Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and the Mega Man franchise. However, he decided to <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> he became tired of making sequels. Minami became the studio's head {{and focused on the}} company's management and administration, while Mikami, Inaba and Kamiya remained in the positions of director or producer.|$|E

Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him <b>leave.</b> <b>As</b> he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him.

5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} <b>leave,</b> <b>as</b> Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that he might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to <b>leave,</b> <b>as</b> in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin {{to be with}} Hitler at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> the Red Army closed in on the capital. After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her marriage certificate she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it with Hitler.|$|E

They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary {{at her home}} and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, to look for it. They <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside to ask to start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 2016, {{he joined}} York's National League rivals Macclesfield Town on loan until 1 January 2017, with Mills unimpressed with his fitness levels and {{disciplinary}} record. Mills implied that Brodie {{would only be}} considered for selection on his return {{if he were to}} reach full fitness. Brodie made his debut two days later as an 88th-minute substitute in Macclesfield's 2–1 away win over Aldershot. He only made the starting line-up once for Macclesfield, with three of his four appearances for the club coming as a substitute. Upon his return to York, Brodie was given permission by Mills to <b>leave,</b> <b>as</b> he wanted to find a club where he would play more regularly. He left York by mutual consent on 11 January 2017.|$|E
5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E

5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes what is at stake and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game). Two masks referred to as the God and Devil Masks lie at the center of the plot, with the God Mask having powers to resurrect the dead. Gabriel intends to defeat the three factions of the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain the pieces of the God Mask and bring back his deceased wife.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to <b>leave</b> <b>as</b> she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance.

Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
