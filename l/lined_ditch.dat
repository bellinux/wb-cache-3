50|$|Lee started {{construction}} of the first earthen dam on the Paria River in January 1872 and by March irrigated his first crop. By April this first dam washed out. Lee soon replaced the dam reinforced with a large base log packed with brush, rocks, and dirt. The dam was subsequently washed out and rebuilt {{many times over the}} coming years. In 1883, in order to bring water to an upper field, Warren Johnson constructed a dam on a second site higher up the Paria. By 1900, the dams were replaced with new ones made of logs and sandbags. In 1905, Irving Pierce constructed a tunnel-and-flume delivery system to replace the ditches bringing water from the upper dam to the fields. By the time Leo Weaver bought the ranch in 1935, several more dams had been washed out. Weaver's attempt to replace the dams also failed. Gus and Warren Griffin made improvements upon the system, including a stone <b>lined</b> <b>ditch.</b> Most of what exists today is related to the Griffin improvements In 1965, the consortium that owned the ranch created two holding ponds for irrigation water against the west wall of Paria canyon. In 1977, the National Park Service pumped water from the Colorado River instead of the Paria. The Park Service constructed a new holding tank near {{the south end of the}} site, at the same time removing remains of the flume system and valve platform for a trail. This system remains in use as of 1999.|$|E

40|$|The canal {{side weir}} {{system is a}} {{relatively}} new method for water distribution to irrigation furrows. The system consists of a concrete <b>lined</b> <b>ditch</b> (canal), equipped with small openings or weirs which deliver the design irrigation flow rate into individual furrows. This research aims at evaluating the proformance characteristics of this system through laboratory, field, and computer studies. A laboratory model was used to establish head discharge relationships for various weirs at different channel velocities. For sharp entranced weirs, discharge for a given head was found to be inverselly proportional to the magnitude of the channel velocity. At small heads (20 - 30 mm), discharge at 0. 3 m/s velocity was found to be about 15 % less than the corresponding discharge at zero channel velocity. For normal irrigation settings (head on the weir = 60 - 80 mm), the difference was about 6 %. Streamline entranced weirs were found to have negligible sensitivity to changes in the channel velocity. Field evaluation studies revealed better overall proformance than conventional systems. For an operating system, an application efficiency of 86 % with uniformity coefficient of 0. 84 at 7 % deficit was calculated. The components of loss were run-off 4 % and deep percolation 10 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 	The goal of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of bioswells in protecting water quality from urban runoff. The hypothesis tested in this project is that water in bioswells improves water quality. Water quality in both a bioswell and an underground concrete <b>lined</b> <b>ditch,</b> both containing ground and surface water, were tested for certain water quality parameters. These parameters consisted of: Dissolved Oxygen, pH, water temperature, weather temperature, Total Dissolved Solids, Specific Conductivity, Alkalinity, Total Dissolved Carbon, Chemical Oxygen Demand, and depth and width of the sampling site. An additional contaminant that was looked at was motor oil. This was measured by comparing Total Organic Carbon with Chemical Oxygen Demand. A variety of different methods to measure the water quality parameters were utilized. The concrete site had more stable readings, but much higher water temperatures. However, the bioswell water is mainly from surface water runoff, and the underground concrete lined pipe is from underground water, so the two cannot be directly compared. The bioswell had high readings, especially pertaining to Oxygen Demand, Total Organic Carbon, and Specific Conductivity in early test dates. But, these readings improved as they were filtered though the bioswell. As plant activity increased and the weather began to warm up there were more stable readings. It is concluded that bioswells are an effective way to reduce problems associated with urban runoff pertaining to certain water quality parameters...|$|E

40|$|The East Tennessee {{landscape}} {{consists of}} varied topography {{that reflects the}} lithology and geologic structure of the area. Karst makes up {{a large part of}} the East Tennessee landscape and is very problematic in locating, designing, and constructing highways. Instead of a reactive approach to dealing with karst in highway planning, design, and construction, this paper proposes a proactive methodology that is needed in karst terrain. Types of karst problems include sinkholes, caves and karren, collapse in-cidents, and groundwater contamination. Typical reactive remedial measures used in correcting karst-related highway problems include bridging, drainage alteration, and relocation. Proactive concepts imple-mented by the Tennessee Department of Transporta-tion include avoidance measures such as relocation of the roadway and drainage design methods in-cluding impervious <b>lined</b> drainage <b>ditches</b> and high-way runoff filtering systems. Additional proactive drainage measures include the use of graded rock pads, overflow channels from sinkholes to free-draining areas, sinkhole opening improvement and protection, and curbs for embankment sections. Innovative and cost-effective remedial concepts for solving karst-related geotechnical problems include avoidance, using <b>lined</b> <b>ditches</b> and graded rock pads, and other bridging- and drainage-related concepts. Stringent land use and building codes for karst areas are required to ensure the success of karst-related remedial design concepts proposed for highways...|$|R

40|$|Non-crop {{habitats}} {{provide important}} resources for natural enemies. Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, {{from which they}} may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them {{to keep pace with}} the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree <b>line,</b> <b>ditch</b> and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m− 2) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m− 2). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m− 2), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m− 2). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control...|$|R

40|$|Furrow irrigation, and {{particularly}} the use of overbank siphons, {{is the most popular}} method in the irrigated cotton industry in Australia. The proportion of the use of pressurised systems in this industry is widely expected to increase but nonetheless furrow irrigation will remain dominant for the foreseeable future. However, furrow irrigation is labour–intensive and often an inefficient method of water application. The desire to reduce labour costs is driving attempts to automate the furrow system. These efforts are mainly focussed on the in-field mode of water delivery into the furrows. This paper reviews the use of overbank siphons to deliver water to the furrows and the alternative water delivery systems, that is, pipes through the bank (PTB), bankless channels, <b>lined</b> head <b>ditches</b> and gated pipe. The potential for use of each these methods in automated systems is explored. Due to limited published data on the hydraulic design of large diameter gated layflat irrigation tubes, a study was undertaken in the Hydraulics Laboratory at the University of Southern Queensland to establish its flow characteristics under low heads and high flow rates typical in the cotton industry. The reviews demonstrate that siphons are technically difficult to automate. The techniques that have successfully been used to automate check gates in bay irrigation systems can easily be adapted to bankless channels, PTBs and <b>lined</b> head <b>ditches.</b> Large diameter gated layflat irrigation tubes with appropriate outlets can supply high flow rates at low heads and can be automated...|$|R

500|$|After the war, Falkes made Bedford Castle his {{headquarters}} and he expanded it considerably, resulting in what David Baker has {{described as a}} [...] "major refortification". Falkes destroyed the neighbouring churches of St Paul's and St Cuthbert's to make space for a new bailey, reusing the stone for the castle. The exact form of the castle after this expansion remains uncertain. The castle {{appears to have been}} quadrangular, with the western edge running along the rear of the modern High Street and the northern edge running along the modern roads of Ram Yard and Castle Lane. The castle had a new barbican; an outer and an inner bailey, with the inner bailey in the south-east corner, protected by an internal ditch and a stone-lined palisade; further stone <b>lined</b> <b>ditches</b> lay around the castle; and a new keep was built on the motte. Brown suspects that the new keep was probably a shell keep with a tower, similar to those built at Launceston or Bungay. The stone-lined palisades and ditches built at Bedford were very unusual in England – their closest equivalent are those found at Skenfrith Castle in Wales. The castle had a postern watergate facing towards the river, and a great hall within the inner bailey in the middle, at least 13 m (43 feet) wide and 40 m (131 feet) long. There was possibly a large stone gatehouse positioned on the outer bailey wall. A mound in the north-east corner of the castle probably supported a large tower.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of predicting porewater salinity based on calibrated surface electromagnetic methods {{is discussed in}} a coastal wetland on the southern banks of Tampa Bay in West-Central Florida. This study utilizes a new method to float commercial land based electromagnetic (EM) instruments in shallow marine waters of less than 1. 5 meters. The floating EM- 31 (Geonics, Ltd.) effectively sensed the magnitude and lateral extent {{of high and low}} salinity porewaters within mangrove <b>lined</b> <b>ditches</b> and ponds. Resistivity and EM geophysical methods are merged with direct sampling data to calibrate layers in electromagnetic models to infer shallow (3 ̆c 30 m) groundwater salinity patterns. Initial marine resistivity surveys are necessary to discriminate between equivalent EM model solutions for seafloor conductivities beneath shallow (0. 1 - 1. 5 m) marine (30 ppt) waters. Using formation factors computed from nearby resistivity surveys, porewater conductivity predictions based on surface EM- 31 and EM- 34 measurements are successful at distinguishing overall porewater salinity trends. At the Tampa Bay study site, the most distinctive terrain conductivity anomalies are associated with mangroves bordering marine waters. Highly elevated porewater conductivities are found within 5 m of the mangrove trunks, falling sharply off within 10 m, presumably due to saltwater exclusion by mangrove roots. Modeling indicates the shallow water EM- 31 measurements probably lack the resolution necessary to image more subtle porewater conductivity variations, such as those expected in association with diffuse submarine groundwater discharge. However, the technique has potential application for locating high contrast zones of freshwater discharge and other salinity anomalies in shallow and nearshore areas not accessible to conventional marine resistivity or land-based arrays, and hence may be useful for interdisciplinary studies of coastal wetland ecosystems...|$|R
