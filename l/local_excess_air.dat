40|$|International audienceIn {{wood chip}} boilers, CO {{emissions}} {{can be reduced}} by improving the control over the combustion process. To minimize emissions and optimize efficiency, the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the primary and secondary air distribution systems, and the fuel feed rates must be adjusted to maintain stable combustion. An extensive series of wood combustion tests was performed in a grate automatic 180 kWth boiler. The level of influence exerted by wood parameters, such as the origin, particle size, and moisture content, and combustion parameters, such as the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio, air distribution, and boiler load, were studied. The most important characteristic of wood with regard to CO emissions is the moisture content. The combustion tests with both types of wood chips and sawdust show that the CO emissions and <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio decline when the fuel power increases. The direct relationship between the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio {{and the level of}} power facilitates the optimization that minimizes the CO emissions. The control system must be based on a fluctuating O- 2 concentration in the exhaust gas by varying the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio relative to the power demand. The <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio needed to implement the optimal conditions should be between 2. 0 and 2. 5 at 100 kWth, between 1. 9 and 2. 1 at 135 kWth, and between 1. 7 and 1. 9 at nominal power...|$|R

In this regard, a PMB together with a heat exchanger is designed and built in the laboratory.

40|$|Mostly the {{performance}} of pulverised fuel fired boiler depends on the combustion process and the emission level in the boiler. Combustion improvement offers the greatest potential for economic savings regarding the operation of industrial boilers and furnaces.

Thus the combustion process {{is affected by the}} amount of <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> required for complete combustion.

Owing to the highly-efficient operation of the flue gas desulfurization units, the SO 2 emissions from the unit were maintained at a relatively low level, 50 - 76 ppm for the above excess-air ratios, whereas they accounted for about 3100 - 3300 ppm at the inlet of the FGD units.
