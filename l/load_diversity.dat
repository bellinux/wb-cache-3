50|$|Even some {{resistive}} loads {{provide only}} short-term benefits. A {{phenomenon known as}} <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> {{plays a role in}} voltage reduction and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements {{will not be able to}} heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating voltage reduction, over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat controlled resistive loads the benefits of voltage reduction can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{theory that}} quantifies transit route passenger-relative load factor and distinguishes it from occupancy load factor. The ratio between these measures {{is defined as}} the <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> coefficient, which as a single measure characterizes the diversity of passenger load factor between route segments according to the origin-destination profile. The relationship between <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> coefficient and route coefficient of variation in occupancy load factor is quantified. Two tables are provided that enhance passenger capacity and quality of service (QoS) assessment regarding onboard passenger load. The first expresses the transit operator’s perspective of <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> and the passengers’ perspective of load factor relative to the operator’s, across six service levels corresponding to ranges of coefficient of variation in occupancy load factor. The second interprets the relationships between passenger average travel time and each of passenger-relative load factor and occupancy load factor. The application of this methodology is illustrated using a case study of a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia. The methodology can assist in benchmarking and decision making regarding route and schedule design. Future research will apply value of time to QoS measurement, reflecting perceived passenger comfort through crowding and average time spent aboard. This would also assist in transit service quality econometric modeling...|$|E

In the UK there is an annual survey of rail passenger crowding, although the measures used do not reflect coach-by-coach variations, nor do they reflect variations across the peak period. In this MPhil thesis I investigated the application of weight-based automatic passenger counting data to deliver more even loadings on trains through the provision of new real-time and static solutions. In addition I investigated the potential benefits of such solutions in terms of reduced dwell times and reduced crowding. The overall concept proposed was {{to make the most of}} the existing available capacity; for example, so that no-one is standing when seats are available. Through analysing a large sample of air suspension data, I identified station-specific trends where some coaches were over capacity while others had spare capacity. I also conducted a critical review of academic research into on-train crowding and solutions that seek to optimise ‘loading diversity’. This study contributes to this emerging subject area in several ways: I propose two new metrics to describe inter-coach <b>loading</b> <b>diversity</b> that, unlike existing metrics, contain information relative to the capacity; I have revealed a link between the inter-coach <b>loading</b> <b>diversity</b> metrics and estimated boarding times, with trains classified as ‘very uneven’ on departure typically having dwell times of approximately five to ten seconds greater than services that were classified as being ‘even’ with a similar total number of passengers on board; and finally I have applied classification supervised learning techniques to predict the load factor for a given service and these predictors were an improvement over taking the historical average...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} in this paper is to analyse the weather {{dependency}} of electrical loads for zones with in the Queensland region of the Australian national electricity market, and to demonstrate the existence of <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> within Queensland due to varying weather conditions. Planning for future new generation plant and transmission augmentations is dependent on load forecasts. It is therefore important to be able to characterize load profiles, and to quantify the <b>load</b> <b>diversity</b> within a system. <b>Load</b> <b>diversity</b> can result in different areas having non-coincident load peaks, and therefore potentially provi ding benefit to a network, by areas of low-load conditions supplying other areas at peak loading conditions. In this paper, multiple regression was performed to relate critical points in the load curve to weather factors, including temperature, humidity an d hours of sunlight. Queensland was divided into ten different zones for analysis, each region displaying different levels of dependency on weather factors. Temperature was consistently found to be the dominant weather factor, other factors improving the weather/demand relationship when included as an input along with temperature levels. Local demand/weather relationships differed significantly from the regional demand/weather relationship.

The HIV- 1 RNA concentration (lower {{limit of detection}} 40 copies/ml) was measured cross-sectionally in cervicovaginal lavages of 108 HIV-positive women from a well-characterised cohort of female sex workers Kigali, Rwanda. Cervical samples of 49 of these women were also evaluated by a phylogenetic microarray specifically designed to characterise the cervicovaginal microbiome. 251 probes were used for co-regularised spectral clustering analysis and 123 probes (specific at species or genus level) to describe microbiome compositions. Results. Six microbiome clusters were identified, representing a gradient from low (semi-quantitative) bacterial <b>load</b> and <b>diversity</b> dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus (R-I) and L. iners (R-II), to intermediate bacterial <b>load</b> and <b>diversity</b> (R-V), to high bacterial <b>load</b> and <b>diversity</b> (R-III, R-IV, and R-VI) dominated by a mixture of (facultative) anaerobes. A statistically significant trend was observed with 10 % of women in clusters R-I/R-II, 40 % of women in cluster R-V, and 42. 1 % of women in cluster R-III/R-IV/R-VI having detectable HIV- 1 RNA (p trend 0. 03). Positive correlations were found between HIV- 1 RNA concentrations and (semi-quantitative) levels of Prevotella spp. (spearman rho 0. 4, p 0. 002), Sneathia spp. (rho 0. 38, p 0. 003) and Dialister spp. (rho 0. 36, p 0. 006). Lactobacillus was the only genus with a negative correlation with HIV- 1 RNA levels (rho 0. 37, p 0. 005). These associations remained significant when adjusted for CD 4 count. In bivariable analysis, other factors associated with detectable genital HIV- 1 RNA levels were not using antiretroviral therapy (ART), genital itching, other specific genital symptoms, abundant cervical mucus on pelvic exam, HPV infection (but not HSV- 2 antibodies), and bacterial vaginosis by Nugent scoring.

Improved {{knowledge}} on {{the relationships between}} the cervicovaginal microbiome and adverse reproductive health outcomes could lead to low cost interventions directed at maintaining and restoring a healthy microbiome. Methods. Cervical samples of 174 female sex workers in Kigali, Rwanda, were analysed cross-sectionally using a phylogenetic microarray specifically designed for the cervicovaginal microbiome. Women with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were purposefully oversampled. Two hundred fifty one probes were used for co-regularised spectral clustering analysis and 123 probes (specific at species or genus level) to describe the cervicovaginal microbiome clusters. Demographic, behavioral, and clinical correlates of the clusters were also determined. Results. Six cervicovaginal microbiome clusters were identified.

5000|$|The {{diversity}} factor {{is almost always}} greater than 1 since all components {{would have to be}} on simultaneously at full load for it to be one. The aggregate load [...] is time dependent as well as being dependent upon equipment characteristics. The {{diversity factor}} recognizes that the whole load does not equal {{the sum of its parts}} due to this time interdependence (i.e. diverseness). For example, we might have ten air conditioning units that are 20 tons each at a facility. In Florida we typically assume that the average full load equivalent operating hours for the units are 2000 hours per year. However, since the units are each thermostatically controlled, we do not know exactly when each unit turns on. If the ten units are substantially bigger than the facility's actual peak A/C load, then fewer than all ten units will likely come on at once. Thus, even though each unit runs a total of 2000 hours a year, they do not all come on at the same time to affect the facility's peak <b>load.</b> The <b>diversity</b> factor gives us a correction factor to use, which results in a lower total kW load for the ten A/C units. If the energy balance we do for this facility comes out within reason, but the demand balance shows far too many kW for the peak load, then we can use the diversity factor to bring the kW into line with the facility's true peak <b>load.</b> The <b>diversity</b> factor does not affect the kWh; it only affects the kW.|$|R

Occupants’ locations within a building vary throughout the day and this distribution can be valuable information when evaluating demand control strategies. Occupancy diversity factors have not been studied as extensively as for example lighting and plug <b>loads</b> <b>diversity</b> factors. Some reasons for fewer studies of occupancy is limitations accessing existing occupancy datasets and challenges interpreting the data. In a research building at UC Berkeley, we were able to add sets of passive infrared (PIR) or motion sensing for occupancy and carbon dioxide sensors in 67 private offices and 2 conference rooms, as well as in multiple open offices. In this work we study deterministic and stochastic building occupancy models based on data from the deployed sets of sensors. Data is analyzed to show major variations of occupancy diversity factors in private offices and conference rooms for time of day, day of the week, holidays, and month of the year. The impact on the building electrical load is highlighted: people usually operate electric lights, computers, and other common office devices when in a space, and this equipment is often turned off or in sleep mode when the space is not occupied. The diversity factors presented in this study can differ as much as 40 % from those published in the literature or in the latest ASHRAE energy cost method guidelines, a document commonly used by energy modelers for building simulations. This may result in misleading simulation results and may introduce inefficiencies in the systems design and control. Therefore we argue that building occupancy is a basic and key factor in energy simulations.
