40|$|In a 4 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> echo {{may arise}} both by {{electrical}} crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset. The echo loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss. In a digital 4 -wire connection, including 4 -wire subscriber lines and digital <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> the main echo paths are found in the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> itself: [...] - t [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Initially, the {{operating}} telephone companies {{wanted to have}} the caller ID function performed by the central office as a voice announcement and charged on a per-call basis. John Harris, an employee of Northern Telecom's <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> manufacturing division in London, Ontario promoted {{the idea of having}} caller ID as a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> display. The <b>telephone</b> was coded ECCS for Enhanced Custom Calling Services. A video of his prototype was used to leverage the feature from the central office to the <b>telephone</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> for the 1A2 systems were modifications of the Bell System standard 500-series telephones for rotary dial systems, and the 2500-series Touch-Tone desk sets. For key system operation these sets were equipped {{with a set of}} push-buttons (keys) and additional internal contact springs to control the additional operational features, resulting in a large variety of specialty telephones. Specifically, such <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). <b>Telephone</b> <b>sets</b> could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R
50|$|LSI {{also allowed}} smaller systems to {{distribute}} the control (and features) into individual <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that don't require any single shared control unit. Generally, these systems are used with a relatively few <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.|$|R

50|$|Each {{connection}} to a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> required six wires from the key system: One pair (two wires) carried the talk circuit (tip and ring), one pair carried control information, known as A-Leads, for that line, designated A and A1, and the third pair carried current to a lamp for the specific line key position on the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> (L and LG).|$|R

50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack (type No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R

50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a key {{telephone}} system (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system manually select their own outgoing lines on special <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically, or formerly, by an operator. The <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> connected to a PBX do not normally have special keys for central-office line control, {{but it is not}} uncommon for key systems to be connected to a PBX to extend its services.|$|R
50|$|All early <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> had dials {{with metal}} finger wheels, while {{starting}} in 1941 the colored thermoplastic units featured clear plastic finger wheels. Dial number plates {{were made from}} steel with a white vitreous enamel face. Black 302 <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were equipped from the factory with straight brown textile-covered cords until 1952, when synthetic rubber (Neoprene) jacketed cords became standard equipment. Optional retractile coiled cords were available both in textile and rubber jackets since the early 1940s.|$|R
