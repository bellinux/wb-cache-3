40|$|Secondary (memory) cell-mediated {{cytotoxic}} {{responses in}} lymphoid cells from CBA/H mice pre-primed with {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCM) 5 - 7 weeks previously were induced by culturing these cells in vitro with syngeneic, infected peritoneal cells at 37 degrees for periods of up to 5 days. Cytotoxic effectors were assayed against LCM infected, H- 2 compatible target cells in a 51 Cr release assay. Response was greater with a higher ratio (1 : 10) of infected peritoneal cells:pre-primed cells than with lower ratios (e. g. 1 : 250). Separating responders from infected cells by a 450 mmum nucleopore membrane (coarse enough to allow passage of virus particles) still permitted induction of a secondary response whilst interposition of a 50 mmum nucleopore membrane (which apparently prevented transit of virus particles) virtually abolished the secondary response. Removal of phagocytic cells from responders prior to setting up memory cultures greatly reduced responders' capacity to be induced. Fixed, infected stimulators still induced strong secondary responses. Secondary response was maximal with spleen cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, or pooled iliac and <b>lumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells. Thymocytes responded less well, whilst mesenteric lymphoid cells and peritoneal cells gave minimal responses. Effector cells from memory cultures killed targets with single-hit kinetics and a rectilinear log effectors: log targets lysed relation held. Memory spleen cells developed increasing cytolytic activity from 2 to 5 days in culture. Memory-generated effectors were markedly potent by day 5, e. g. giving 70 per cent specific release at a killer:target ratio of 0 - 8 : 1. Peak DNA synthesis occurred on day 4. We conclude that memory effectors as a population differ in kinetics and potency from effectors obtained by primary viral challenge in the mouse...|$|E
30|$|Despite low {{incidence}} of lymph node (LN) metastases in renal cancer (RCC), dissemination into lymph nodes portends extremely poor prognosis [1, 2]. In low risk and high risk cancers, the detection rate with a routine pathohistological staining is only 4 % and 10 %, respectively and lymph node dissection (LND) in low risk cancers has no proven survival benefit [3, 4]. Furthermore, lymphatic drainage in renal tumors is unpredictable and drainage outside local retroperitoneal lymph nodes {{may be one}} of the reasons for the lack of a survival advantage with conventional LND [5 – 7]. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) typically consists of a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy to indicate the anatomical location of the first tumor-draining lymph nodes, i.e., the sentinel node(s), combined with a γ-probe guided surgical biopsy of these nodes. SLNB may improve staging of RCC especially in patients who have aberrant drainage within or outside retroperitoneal <b>lumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> basins and might have a role in future translational research of tumor immunology and biology of early metastasis. It has been suggested in prostate cancer that extended pelvic lymph node dissection combined with SLNB increases the yield of nodal lymph node metastases, especially in high risk disease [8]. Due to proven efficacy in staging procedures in many cancer types and less associated morbidity of SLNB compared to LND, SLNB is routinely used in melanoma, breast, head-neck, vulvar, cervical, and penile cancer and actively studied in many other tumor types [9, 10]. Feasibility of SLNB procedure in renal tumors has been studied and confirmed earlier by our group and others [11, 12]. However, both groups had high rate of non-visualization of sentinel lymph node (SN) on scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Also, the procedure is currently lacking standardization. These factors may hamper widespread applicability and adoption to further study its use in clinical practice. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine incidence and predictive factors of non-visualization of SN on scintigraphy and SPECT/CT in renal tumors, evaluate detection rate at surgery, and propose a standardized protocol for future studies.|$|E

Nevertheless, CLN from EAE-affected CCR 7 -deficient mice contained equal amounts of myelin and neuronal antigens as wild-type mice.

Furthermore, the olfactory tract and the brainstem were dissected to examine the pathways of red blood cells within the subarachnoid space. Erythrophagocytosis and siderophagocytosis were visualized by hematoxylin & eosin, Goldner?s trichrome and Prussian blue reaction. Additionally, macrophages were immunohistochemically characterized by monoclonal ED 1 antibody. To distinguish <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sinus from <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> vessels, immunohistochemistry for cytoskeletal proteins was used. Red blood cells are visible in the marginal sinus of the cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (consisting of superficial and deep nodes) as soon as 10 min after brain injury. After 16 h, the <b>lumbar</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> showed the presence of red blood cells, too.

The lymphoid organs examined were the Peyer's patches, spleen, somatic (submandibular, deep cervical, brachial, axillary, inguinal and popliteal) and visceral (mesenteric and <b>lumbar)</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Primary follicles appeared in most somatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> 6 d after birth. The number of follicles per node then increased rather sharply in larger <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and slowly in smaller nodes, up to 28 d of age, reaching a level which varied according to the location of the node. Thereafter, the number of follicles in the somatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> increased only slightly to moderately, reaching a peak or plateau at 8 – 12 wk. In the mesenteric (ileocaecal) nodes, primary follicles first appeared at 12 d, then increased linearly during the suckling period and after weaning to reach a plateau at 8 wk of age. Germinal centres appeared in the submandibular and mesenteric nodes at 28 d and their numbers increased consistently in the latter, while remaining low in the former. The impact of possible ‘natural’ exogenous antigen stimulation of the various <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was estimated from the presence of IgM-synthesising cells and germinal centres. Differences between the patterns of age-dependent changes in the numbers of lymph follicles observed in the somatic and mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> during their ontogeny are discussed in relation to differences in the magnitude of the exogenous antigen stimulatory effect.

He noted the wide inflammatory, changes of the subderma of the dorsal region surrounding the inoculated site.

A murine model of genital infection was developed to investigate the pathogenicity and immune response associated with a W. chondrophila infection. Genital inoculation of the bacterial agent resulted in a dose-dependent infection that spread to <b>lumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and successively to spleen and liver. Bacterial-induced pathology peaked on day 14, characterized by leukocyte infiltration (uterine horn, liver and spleen), necrosis (liver) and extramedullary hematopoiesis (spleen).

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is a {{pathogen}} of the {{genital tract}} and ocular epithelium. Infection is {{established by the}} binding of the metabolically inert elementary body (EB) to epithelial cells. These are taken up by endocytosis into a membrane-bound vesicle termed an inclusion. The inclusion avoids fusion with host lysosomes, and the EBs differentiate into the metabolically active reticulate body (RB), which replicates by binary fission within the protected environment of the inclusion. During the extracellular EB stage of the C. trachomatis life cycle, antibody present in genital tract or ocular secretions can inhibit infection both in vivo and in tissue culture. The RB, residing within the intracellular inclusion, is not accessible to antibody, and resolution of infection at this stage requires a cell-mediated immune response mediated by gamma interferon-secreting Th 1 cells. Thus, an ideal vaccine to protect against C. trachomatis genital tract infection should induce both antibody (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and IgG) responses in mucosal secretions to prevent infection by chlamydial EB and a strong Th 1 response to limit ascending infection to the uterus and fallopian tubes. In the present study we show that transcutaneous immunization with major outer membrane protein (MOMP) in combination with both cholera toxin and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides elicits MOMP-specific IgG and IgA in vaginal and uterine lavage fluid, MOMP-specific IgG in serum, and gamma interferon-secreting T cells in reproductive tract-draining caudal and <b>lumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> This immunization protocol resulted in enhanced clearance of C. muridarum (C. trachomatis, mouse pneumonitis strain) following intravaginal challenge of BALB/c mice...|$|R

The structure is composed of a systemic network of thread-like vessels and nodes. Previous studies have confirmed the presence of stem cells in Primo Nodes (PNs), however little is known regarding the physiological function of the PVS. A sub-type of the PVS has been found inside lymphatic and vascular vessels. A recent study reported visualizing intra-lymphatic Primo Vessels (IL-PVs) using Hollow Gold Nano spheres measuring 50 - 120 nm in diameter. Our overall hypothesis is that the PVS collects exsomes from lymphatic fluid, channeling them towards PNs to facilitate their interaction with stem and immune cells in response to physiological stimuli to maintain homeostasis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop synthetic exosomes (SEs) with a membrane lipid composition similar to those released by PC- 3 prostate cancer cells.

The present study used flow cytometric immunofluorescence analyses to investigate changes in number and phenotype of lymphocytes in seven different lymphoid compartments at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 60 days after 50 % total body-surface area thermal injury in the rat. Relative to sham-injured control rats, at postburn day 2, significant lymphopenia was observed in the peripheral blood along with depletion of lymphocytes from the spleen and thymus. By day 6 after injury, lymphocytes in the bone marrow and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> decreased significantly while numbers in the spleen and thymus remained depressed. Splenic and cervical node lymphocyte numbers normalized by day 12, the bone marrow and thymus numbers still were significantly lower than control, and a 6. 5 -fold increase in number of lymphocytes was observed in the nodes draining the burn wound, pooled axillary, brachial, inguinal, and <b>lumbar</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> At day 24 after injury, the thymus and bone marrow virtually were depleted of lymphocytes, the mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> manifested a significant decrease, and lymphocytes in the nodes draining the burn wound continued to increase in number. This same pattern was maintained on day 48, but numbers of lymphocytes in the mesenteric nodes normalized. At day 60 after injury, lymphocyte numbers in all tissues were normalized, but the spleen and nodes draining the burn wound where increased numbers compared to control persisted. Cell-surface phenotyping was performed on all lymphoid tissues at all time intervals to determine the percentages of lymphocytes comprising the following subsets: Ia+ cells (B cells and activated T cells), T cells, T-Helper/Inducer cells (T-H/I), and T-Suppressor/Cytotoxic (T-S/C) cells. Although changes in lymphocyte subset percentages were complex, they could be divided grossly into two phases. First, all compartments showed significant phenotypic changes {{in the first six}} days after burn. With the exception of the nodes draining the burn wound and the blood, this was followed by a return towards normal on day 12. The second phase then ensued with significant phenotypic changes again occurring in most tissues from days 24 to 60 after injury. These studies demonstrate that burn injury results in dramatic alterations in lymphocyte numbers and subset percentages in different lymphoid compartments. Immune alterations observed following thermal injury may be due, in part, to a redistribution of the cellular elements responsible for generation of the immune response...|$|R

Radiation was detected with a gamma probe. Results: the statistical study indicated count rates significantly higher in the SLN than in the other basins for both the dextran (P < 0. 01) and phytate groups (P < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference concerning SLN absorption in either group (P= 0. 2981). in the dextran group, migration occurred to 1. 5 lymphatic basins with counting higher than 10 % of that found in the SLN versus 0. 8 in the phytate group (P= 0. 0023). Migration was thus higher in the dextran group (P= 0. 0207). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between dextran and phytate in the SLN identification, but the phytate migrated to fewer lymphatic basins beyond the SLN and with less intensity.

Methods For this study, the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 255, containing the mmp- 9 gene, was constructed and used to treat PC- 3 tumor-bearing mice, achieving an intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP- 9. The intra-tumoral MMP- 9 content was quantified by immunohistochemistry in tumor sections. Therapeutic efficacy of GLV- 1 h 255 was evaluated by monitoring tumor growth kinetics and intra-tumoral virus titers. Microenvironmental changes mediated by the intra-tumoral MMP- 9 over-expression were investigated by microscopic quantification of the collagen IV content, the blood vessel density (BVD) and the analysis of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis formation. Results GLV- 1 h 255 -treatment of PC- 3 tumors led to a significant over-expression of intra-tumoral MMP- 9, accompanied by a marked decrease in collagen IV content in infected tumor areas, when compared to GLV- 1 h 68 -infected tumor areas. This led to considerably elevated virus titers in GLV- 1 h 255 infected tumors, and to enhanced tumor regression. The analysis of the BVD, as well as the <b>lumbar</b> and renal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> volumes, revealed lower BVD and significantly smaller <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in both GLV- 1 h 68 - and GLV- 1 h 255 - injected mice compared to those injected with PBS, indicating that MMP- 9 over-expression does not alter the metastasis-reducing effect of oncolytic VACV. Conclusions Taken together, these results indicate that a GLV- 1 h 255 -mediated intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP- 9 leads to a degradation of collagen IV, facilitating intra-tumoral viral dissemination, and resulting in accelerated tumor regression. We propose that approaches which enhance the oncolytic effect by increasing the intra-tumoral viral load, may be an effective way to improve therapeutic outcome. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of the esophagogastric junction cancer is growing rapidly. The {{purpose of this}} study is to clarify the outcome of the ratio between metastatic and examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in esophagogastric junction cancer patients with or without 7 examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> METHODS: A total of 3, 481 patients who underwent operation are identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Different <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected groups are analyzed to test the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio factor. RESULTS: There are 2522 patients with 7 or more <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected and 959 patients with less than 7 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement are independent prognostic factors. But the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio categories have a better prognostic value than the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement categories. Compared with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement categories, <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio categories represent patients with more homogeneous overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines that the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio is an independent prognostic factor for esophagogastric junction cancer. The <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio can prevent stage migration and may be a helpful system to predict the prognosis of esophagogastric junction cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveA metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{commonly}} becomes enlarge; however, {{there is}} limited data available {{with regard to the}} direct measurement of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and their clinicopathologic characteristics. MethodsThe size of dissected <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was quantified in a total of 848 nodes with metastasis and 10, 462 nodes without metastasis from 454 patients with lung cancer who underwent a pulmonary resection with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. ResultsThe short axis and the volume of the metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were significantly greater than those of the nonmetastatic ones. The smaller the <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> the less frequently the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were metastatic; however, the ratios of nodes smaller than the fifth largest <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> with metastasis of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were 21. 8 to 26. 2 %, respectively. When the hilar and mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stations were examined, 1. 14 to 4. 00 % of the lung cancer patients had <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in small <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> despite having no metastases in the largest and second largest <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> ConclusionsThe small <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the hilar or mediastinal stations frequently had metastases of carcinoma even though largest and second largest <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were negative for metastases, especially in adenocarcinoma cases.
