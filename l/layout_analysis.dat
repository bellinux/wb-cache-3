50|$|In {{computer}} vision, document <b>layout</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{the process}} of identifying and categorizing the regions of interest in the scanned image of a text document. A reading system requires the segmentation of text zones from non-textual ones and the arrangement in their correct reading order. Detection and labeling of the different zones (or blocks) as text body, illustrations, math symbols, and tables embedded in a document is called geometric <b>layout</b> <b>analysis.</b> But text zones play different logical roles inside the document (titles, captions, footnotes, etc.) and this kind of semantic labeling is the scope of the logical <b>layout</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{combinatorial}} {{nature of}} the facility layout problem, current heuristic computer procedures do not always provide better solutions than visual methods. A new algorithm, FLAC (Facility <b>Layout</b> by <b>Analysis</b> of Clusters), is described which emulates the visual methods used by industrial engineers in solving facility layout problems. Initially side-stepping the combinatorial {{nature of the}} problem, FLAC is found to perform well in problems with high as well as low flow dominance, and in the presence and absence of line dominance.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of small and medium sized enterprises (SEMs), the direct costs of material handling cannot be clearly measured. There are several reasons for this, including {{the large number of}} product types, complexity of their production cycle, and continuous change in markets. Therefore, production managers require flexible tools to create a suitable material handling system model which explicitly and rapidly calculates the indices required as these are traditionally neglected or laboriously approximated, (i. e., time and cost in material flow inside the factory, storage area requirements, and MH utilization percentage). This paper proposes an integrated approach to analyzing and controlling material handling operations in an industrial manufacturing plant from a “full quantitative” point of view. The model presented unites quite different fields of research into a unique methodology. This material handling model rapidly and automatically provides production managers with extensive and significant information. As a result, integrated <b>layout</b> flow <b>analysis</b> interrelates systematic <b>layout</b> planning with operational research algorithms and visual interactive simulation, using a complete software platform to implement them. This integrated <b>layout</b> flow <b>analysis</b> approach focuses on determining the space requirement for manufacturing department buffers, the transportation system requirements, the performance indices, and the time and cost of material flows spent in the layout and in MH traffic jams...|$|R

50|$|Document <b>layout</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{the union}} of {{geometric}} and logical labeling.

50|$|In Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Document <b>Layout</b> <b>Analysis,</b> {{regions of}} {{interest}} (ROIs) hierarchically encompass pages, text or graphical blocks, down to individual line-strip images, word and character image boxes.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} to document <b>layout</b> <b>analysis.</b> Firstly, there are bottom-up approaches which iteratively parse a document based on the raw pixel data. These approaches typically first parse a document into connected regions of black and white, then these regions are grouped into words, then into text lines, and finally into text blocks. Secondly, there are top-down approaches which attempt to iteratively cut up a document into columns and blocks based on white space and geometric information.|$|E

40|$|EDA tools have {{facilitated}} {{the design of}} ever more complex integrated circuits each year. Synthetic biology would also benefit from the development of genetic design automation (GDA) tools. Existing GDA tools require biologists to design genetic circuits at the molecular level, roughly equivalent to designing electronic circuits at the <b>layout</b> level. <b>Analysis</b> of these circuits is also performed at this very low level. This paper presents a first step at developing a GDA tool that supports higher levels of abstraction. In particular, this paper describes a graphical specification language from which molecular descriptions can be synthesized. These descriptions can then be abstracted to facilitate efficient analysis. I...|$|R
50|$|Tesseract {{up to and}} {{including}} version 2 could only accept TIFF images of simple one-column text as inputs. These early versions did not include <b>layout</b> <b>analysis,</b> and so inputting multi-columned text, images, or equations produced garbled output. Since version 3.00 Tesseract has supported output text formatting, hOCR positional information and page-layout analysis. Support for a number of new image formats was added using the Leptonica library. Tesseract can detect whether text is monospaced or proportionally spaced.|$|E
50|$|Electrically {{connecting}} the failing pin to a ground pin produced the electric current path {{shown in figure}} 2. This electrical path strongly suggests that the current is somehow flowing through all the ground nets though a conductive path located {{very close to the}} wirebond pads from the top down view of the package. Based on electrical and <b>layout</b> <b>analysis</b> of the package, it can be inferred that current is either flowing through the wirebond pads or that the wirebonds are somehow touching a conductive structure at the specified location. After obtaining similar SSM results on the two units under test, further destructive analysis focused around the small potential short region, and it showed that the failing pin wirebond is touching the bottom of one of the stacked dice at the specific XY position highlighted by SSM analysis. The cross section view of one of those units is shown in figure 3.|$|E
50|$|OCRFeeder has {{a simple}} {{graphical}} user interface {{that is designed to}} the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.It performs a Document <b>Layout</b> <b>Analysis</b> and transfers the layout to capable output formats. It searches for content areas, outlines them and guesses the content type (text or image) and processes text areas through the OCR back-end. It can use virtually any command-line OCR engine as back-end and features auto-detection and auto-configuration for all popular free engines. OCR back-ends may be either auto-configured, the necessary command line entered in a GUI dialogue or configured directly via a XML file. Scan image post-processing including de-skewing can be done. All recognition results can be reviewed and edited before saving to the desired output format. Sessions can be saved and loaded. The suite also includes a spell checker. OCRFeeder has built-in procedures for the post-processing of the raw OCR results returned by the OCR engine. It can remove remaining segmentation to printed lines of text, even with removal of hyphenation.|$|E
