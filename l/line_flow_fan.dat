It {{can be used for}} cooling, ventilation or for drying purposes. These include cooling towers for air-conditioning and ventilation, humidifiers in textile mills, air heat exchangers for various chemical processes, ventilation and exhaust as in mining industry. In consideration of all these application various efforts in the past have been done to evaluate the performance of axial <b>flow</b> <b>fans.</b> In the present work computational investigation of axial <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> with Forward and Backward Skewed blade profile carried out using CFD software FLUENT 6. 3 and the results are compared with the experimental results from literature.

40|$|Space {{constraints}} in many emerging {{electronic systems}} {{mean that there}} is a growing demand for heat sinks which are low in profile. As a result, small, low profile fans are necessary.

For radial <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> little work has been done to quantify the deviation of aerodynamic performance from that predicted by conventional fan laws. This paper aims to address this situation, by performing measurements of pressure rise, flow rate and power consumption for 3. 5 mm high radial <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> rotors ranging in diameter from 20 to 35 mm over a range of speeds. Measurements presented show variations of pressure rise and flow rate with Reynolds number to be largely in accordance with trends predicted by high Reynolds number theory, with the exception of flow rates at the lower range of Reynolds numbers which fell below the predicted values. Variations in power consumption show a similar trend to those of flow rate, with power consumption obeying the fan laws for the higher Reynolds numbers investigated, but showing a large increase at the lower Reynolds numbers.

30|$|Glacial {{recession}} in Alpine Valleys uncorks low-altitude tributary valleys that spill trapped sediments in the sediment cascade, in turn generating sediment-related hazards and flood hazards. Within this complex, the present contribution investigates the transition zone between the tributary {{and the main}} valley at Fox Glacier, New Zealand, where glacier recession has allowed the development of large debris <b>flow</b> <b>fans.</b> As the valley is narrow and its geomorphology is rapidly evolving, 3 D point cloud technologies based on aerial photogrammetry from UAV or ground and airborne laser technologies are essential to understand the geomorphology and generate boundary conditions to run hazard simulations such as debris flows. Using airborne structure from motion photogrammetry with ground control points collected by RTK-GNSS, we investigated (1) the geomorphology of the valley to understand its evolution and (2) the role of this recent evolution on the flood hazards at the Yellow Creek debris <b>flow</b> <b>fan.</b> The geomorphology of the Fox River valley is a typical U-shape valley with steep valley walls that command the valley by more than 1000  m. The valley walls {{are connected to the}} bottom of the valley by active sediment aprons and debris <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> at the exit of the tributaries. The slopes present several topographic steps or noses on both the aprons and the debris <b>flow</b> <b>fans.</b> By comparison with the glacial recession, they can be related to past locations of the limits of the glacier. On Straight Creek fan, the ridges are perpendicular to the valley and divide the fan between an overgrown half downstream the Fox Valley and an upstream section thinner and smaller. This pattern was also created by the presence of the glacier that stopped the development of the fan on its right (upstream half) while developing the true left hand side of the fan. On the other side of the valley, the debris <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> of Yellow Creek presents a series of deep trough that control water flows. Flood simulations show that these controls can be overcome and instead of being channeled in other sub-channels, the flow tends to spread on the true right (downstream) end of the fan as a sheet flow. In the 2014 state of the fan, the safest location was thus on the true left half of the fan towards the glacier. Such information is essential as tourists occupy the valley and walk towards the glacier the whole year.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present CFD {{analysis}} {{is aimed at}} studying the effect of tip injection on the performance and flow characteristics in the tip region of an axial <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> under distorted inflow condition. Inlet flow distortions are flow non-uniformities that cause a reduction in performance and operating flow ranges of axial <b>flow</b> <b>fan.</b> CFD simulations were carried out for the following configurations: (a) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion without tip injection and (b) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion with tip injection. The configuration with six injectors, injector velocity of 60 m/s, 0 ° pitch angle, and injector skew angle of- 15 ° (in an orientation opp. osing the direction of rotor rotation) is used for tip injection study. Total pressure values have been noted down from Ansys CFX post at the exit of the axial fan, both in distorted and uniform regions (with and without tip injection case). The simulation results are analyzed to obtain axial fan performance parameters like the pressure rise coefficient, flow coefficient. The result of the present analysis shows that the tip injection increases the pressure rise by 4. 04 % in distorted inflow for pitch angle of 0 o and skew angle of- 15 o.

40|$|Axial <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> {{are often}} the largest {{contributor}} to the noise emitted from commercial refrigerator systems. This has driven the demand for quieter, yet higher performance axial <b>flow</b> <b>fans.</b> Turbulent fluid motion and aerodynamic forces interacting with the fan blades generate noise as the fan rotates. The aerodynamic noise emitted from a fan can be modelled {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy which are typically proportional to the computational cost. Application of a fan performance model to an optimisation algorithm can be used to develop new and higher performing fan blades. However, there is currently no rapid method to generate an optimal fan design of specified performance. The method developed in this project was experimentally validated and shown to be able to predict the flow rate accurately; however, the fan noise prediction was unsuccessful. Noise source identification showed that the dominant fan noise source was incident turbulence noise which was neglected in the aeroacoustic modelling and explains the poor noise prediction. Knowing the dominant noise source allows for future modelling to include all relevant physics which will allow for more accurate modelling that will increase the performance of axial <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> and reduce refrigeration noise. This study also showed that fans with aerofoil blade shapes have superior performance to fans with cambered plate blades, which are commonly used in commercial refrigerators. ii...|$|R

40|$|The work {{reported}} centres on {{the application}} of cross <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> units to provide forced air flow over the radiator used for engine cooling. It is shown that a cooling {{system in which the}} airflow is ducted through the vehicle would lead to a significant reduction in vehicle drag. A ducted system allows more exact prediction of performance, and can be more easily designed in conjunction with across <b>flow</b> <b>fan,</b> that has rectangular inlet and outlet sections, and an ability to form 'S', 'L' and 'U' airflow geometries. This shape advantage of the cross <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> also allows the use of radiators with a higher aspect ratio that could in turn permit lower bonnet lines on vehicles with a further reduction in aerodynamic drag. At higher vehicle speeds adequate cooling is usually provided by ram airflow through the cooling system. An airflow by-pass arrangement controlled by a balance valve has been devised and tested. The operation of this valve was found to be stable and smooth, and extremely beneficial in reducing the total system resistance and increasing fan performance under ram airflow conditions. A computer model has been developed and a programme produced to facilitate matching of the air circuit, fan and motor.
