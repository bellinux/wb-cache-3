5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his <b>look</b> <b>from</b> child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|UK {{department}} store retailer Debenhams' collaboration with designers, launched in 1993 under their Designers at Debenhams range, was a success. Hoping to recapture {{some of their}} lost market share, Marks and Spencer (M) asked Everest to review their menswear range. As Creative Consultant, he designed the Sartorial suiting line for their menswear collection. In October 2000, he designed the Autograph suiting line. Noting that the M range consisted of Italian-style suiting, he aimed to achieve a more 'British' <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the cut, fit and styling and by using different fabrics and colours. He also has responsibility for their Luxury collection. During M advertising campaigns, his designs for the Autograph range have been modelled by several British celebrities, including David Beckham, Bryan Ferry, Jimmy Carr, Martin Freeman, Bob Mortimer and Take That. In 2007, M were selected by The Football Association as 'Official Tailor to the England football team' and Everest designed the team's official suits for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to <b>look</b> <b>from</b> cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E

25|$|In June 2006, much of Margaret's {{estate was}} {{auctioned}} by Christie's to meet inheritance tax, {{though some of}} the items were sold in aid of charities such as the Stroke Association. A world record price of £1.24million was set by a Fabergé clock. The Poltimore tiara, which she wore for her wedding in 1960, sold for £926,400. The sale of her effects totalled £13,658,000. In April 2007, an exhibition titled Princess Line – The Fashion Legacy of Princess Margaret opened at Kensington Palace, showcasing contemporary fashion from British designers such as Vivienne Westwood inspired by Princess Margaret's legacy of style. Christopher Bailey's Spring 2006 collection for Burberry was inspired by Margaret's <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|After {{his short}} stint at San Lorenzo, he {{was traded to}} his {{hometown}} team, Talleres and later Racing de Córdoba. In 1996, he joined Belgrano of the Primera B Nacional Argentina; {{for the next two}} years he would be the starter winning Belgrano a promotion to the Primera División Argentina. He moved on to Los Andes, again helping his club to a promotion to the Primera División. Sala's good play earned him a <b>look</b> <b>from</b> Argentine powerhouse River Plate who bought his rights. After earning a few non-league match starts, he was loaned out to rival Independiente where he started for two seasons. After two seasons Independiente were looking to buy Sala, but the price was not right. As the Argentine economy unraveled, River officials looked to loan him to a team that could actually afford Sala's price tag; Deportivo Cali in Colombia was that club.|$|E
25|$|The revival {{retains the}} live, {{handcrafted}} <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the original, {{a decision that}} Hodgson had to set down against others involved in production. Set and prop designers included Wayne White, Pendleton Ward, Rebecca and Steven Sugar, and Guy Davis, while live and practical special effects were planned by Adam Savage. Among other staff included returning MST3K crew, including: Charlie Erickson, who composed the original show's theme song and composed the new show's theme and other musical arrangements; Beez McKeever, {{who worked on the}} original show's props and designed costumes and props for the new show; Crist Ballas performed hair and makeup design; and Paul Chaplin, one of the show's original writers to help write the new shows, along with contributions from Pehl and Corbett. Hodgson himself remained primarily off-camera as the executive producer for the remake, though does appear briefly as Ardy, one of Kinga's henchmen that send Jonah the episode's movie. Hodgson was assisted by Kalan, Richard Foos, Bob Emmer, Garson Foos, Jonathan Stern, and Harold Buchholz.

500|$|The {{music video}} was shot over two days, at A Soundstages in Hollywood, California. Madonna had adopted a garish, {{platinum}} blond hairstyle for the Who's That Girl movie which she {{used in the}} music video; it was her way of reviving the comedy heroine of the 1930s Hollywood screwball comedies.

The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the GameCube version, and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure." [...] For the sixth main game, Chris has been redesigned slightly; he now has a slightly disheveled look due to his alcoholism and post-traumatic amnesia. In 2016, IGN made a video focusing on his evolution throughout the series.|$|E

It shows several guests inside a mansion dancing and drinking at the table, and then shows Koda singing in a maid outfit. Small inter cut scenes features Koda kissing two woman; one on the cheek, {{and one on the}} lips. This emphasizes the homosexual themes that Koda explained to World Journal and Oricon. Koda starts to sing in a living room, surrounded by several guests. She walks into a bathroom, and her maid outfit transforms into a small black jumpsuit, similar to the <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the CD cover sleeve of [...] "Taboo".

500|$|Karen Tye spoke favourably of the album, {{saying they}} had [...] "ditched the cutesy voices and effervescent ditties" [...] and {{replaced}} it with acoustic pop and rock which occasionally bordered on country. She praised M2M for using [...] "down-to-earhtunes and thoughtful lyrics" [...] instead of revealing outfits to propel them into the limelight, unlike many of their pop counterparts. Conversely, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was critical of M2M's new image in the album artwork. Erlewine said they had ditched their sweet and innocent <b>look</b> <b>from</b> Shades of Purple, for [...] "lots of makeup, crimped hair [...] fairly low-cut tops". He gave the album four and a half stars out of five, concluding [...] "If M2M needs to play up their good looks to sell an album this pleasing, so be it. This is an album that deserves to find its audience, even through tactics as blatant as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Warwick Davis played Filius Flitwick in {{the first}} two films as an old dwarf-like man with gray hair. In {{pre-production}} for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but {{that they would like to}} have him play somebody else, at least for a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man with black hair and a moustache who directed the choir at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, and was credited as portraying [...] "Wizard". During pre-production for the fourth film, director Mike Newell told Davis he wanted to keep his <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the last film but make this the new look for Flitwick. Davis now considers the character he has played some relative of Flitwick, though he is still credited as [...] "Filius Flitwick". In the sixth film, Harry specifically calls him Professor Flitwick, as does McGonagall in the seventh, calling him Filius.|$|E

500|$|The geisha {{look was}} further {{reproduced}} for Madonna's {{appearance on the}} May–June 1999 issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. The singer took partial creative control of the issue, and requested photographer of the shoot Patrick Demarchelier to incorporate elements of the novel Memoirs of a Geisha into it, both visually and typographically. Three covers were selected for different regions around the world. In 2016, the geisha look was adapted on the Logo TV series RuPaul's Drag Race, season eight. The show's host, RuPaul, announced that contestants had to create a gown that was inspired by Madonna's iconic looks. Four drag queen contestants wore the geisha look, including one sporting a similar <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the singer's music video [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)". A fifth contestant decided on wearing a kimono from the video of [...] "Nothing Really Matters", but changed.

500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed <b>look</b> <b>from</b> the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E
