To that end, we conducted an experiment in Uyghur, an agglutinative language from the Turkic family that employs an Arabic-based script in which both consonants and vowels are explicitly written.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{predictions}} of a dual-route model of complex word reading according to which morpho-orthographic segmentation is hypothesised to require a fine-grained orthographic code that would be particularly sensitive to letter order, whereas morpho- semantic representations are hypothesised to be most rapidly accessed via a coarse- grained orthographic code that is less sensitive to letter order. We predicted that letter transpositions would disrupt morpho-orthographic processing more than morpho- semantic processing. In line with these predictions, Experiment 1 showed no priming from opaque pseudo-derived primes containing a <b>letter</b> <b>transposition</b> at the morpheme boundary (masetr-mast) relative to replaced letter controls (masicr-mast) {{in the presence of}} significant priming from transposed-letter transparent derived primes (banekr-bank).

40|$|Developing readers {{often make}} anagrammatical errors (e. g. misreading pirates as parties), {{suggesting}} they use letter position flexibly during word recognition. However, {{while it is}} widely assumed that the occurrence of these errors decreases with increases in reading skill, empirical evidence to support this distinction is lacking. Accordingly, we compared the performance of developing child readers (aged 8 - 10  years) against the end-state performance of skilled adult readers in a timed naming task, employing anagrams used previously {{in this area of}} research. Moreover, to explore the use of letter position by developing readers and skilled adult readers more fully, we used anagrams which, to form another word, required <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> over only interior letter positions, or both interior and exterior letter positions. The patterns of effects across these two anagram types for the two groups of readers were very similar. In particular, both groups showed similarly slowed response times (and developing readers increased errors) for anagrams requiring only interior <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> but not for anagrams that required exterior <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions.</b> This similarity in the naming performance of developing readers and skilled adult readers suggests that the end-state skilled use of letter position is established earlier during reading development than is widely assumed.

40|$|<b>Letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> are {{relatively}} harmless for reading English and other Indo-European languages with an alphabetic script, but severely disrupt comprehension in Hebrew. Furthermore, masked orthographic priming {{does not produce}} facilitation as in English (Frost, 2012).

The greater disruption of transpositions for Hebrew as compared to English is correctly replicated by the model, as is the relative immunity of loanwords in Hebrew to <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions.</b> Furthermore, the absence of facilitation of form priming in Hebrew is correctly predicted. The results confirm {{the hypothesis that the}} distributional statistics of the orthographic cues in the two languages are the crucial factor determining the experimental hallmarks of orthographic processing, as argued by Frost (2012). In a recent study, Frost (2012) calls attention to an intriguing difference between Hebrew and English. English readers suffer little when letters are transposed or exchanged. For instance, anwser was found to provide the same amount of priming for the target ANSWER as the correct orthographic form, answer, itself (Forster, Davis, Schoknecht, & Carter, 1987; Perea & Lupker, 2003).

We conducted two lexical decision experiments to investigate masked morphological priming in Spanish. Experiment 1 showed that equal magnitudes of masked stem-target priming are obtained for both morphologically complex word primes (e. g., doloroso-DOLOR [painful-PAIN]) and morphologically complex nonword primes that included <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> within the stem (e. g., dlooroso-DOLOR). Experiment 2 used morphologically complex nonword primes comprising lexically illegal combinations of stems and suffixes (e. g., total + ito [a little total]). Priming was obtained for morphologically related nonword primes (e. g., totalito-TOTAL), but not for nonword primes that included <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> within the pseudostem (e. g., ttoalito-TOTAL).

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether it is possible to read a word for meaning without phonological mediation. The task was semantic categorization. Participants decided whether or not each target word belonged to the category “words with definable meanings” (e. g., PLANK, PINT) or the category “given names” (e. g., TRENT, PAM). To test phonological mediation, latencies to respond to regular definable words (e. g., PLANK) and irregular definable words (e. g. PINT) were compared. No regularity effect was observed, despite these same words showing a difference in a naming task. Thus the semantic task was shown to be insensitive to a phonological effect. The possibility that the long response times of the semantic categorization task washed out any regularity effect was dismissed on the grounds that both a word frequency effect and a <b>letter</b> <b>transposition</b> effect (e. g., CLUE vs CALM, cf. CLAM) were observed using this task. It is concluded that phonological mediation is not a prerequisite for semantic access...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} effect is moderated by experimental design, affecting recall in within-subjects designs but typically not in between-subjects designs. However, N. W.

In addition, the generate condition but not the read condition produced hypermnesia (increased recall over tests). The present experiments demonstrate that semantic-based (semantic-associate and category-associate) generation tasks produce this pattern of results whereas nonsemantic (<b>letter</b> <b>transposition,</b> rhyme, word fragment) generation tasks do not. Thus, the emergent generation effect {{appears to be a}} byproduct of semantic elaboration rather than a direct product of generation. In addition, high- and low-imagery words produced equivalent hypermnesia and emergent generation effects, arguing against a mediating role for imagistic encoding. Finally, {{there is no evidence of}} an emergent generation effect for nonwords, another traditional limiting condition of the generation effect.

40|$|Models of {{morphological}} processing make different {{predictions about}} whether morphologically complex written words are initially decomposed and recognized {{on the basis}} of their morphemic subunits or whether they can directly be accessed as whole words and at what point semantics begin to influence morphological processing. In this study, we used unprimed and masked primed lexical decision to compare truly suffixed (darkest) and pseudosuffixed words (glossary) with within-boundary (d ra kest/g ol ssary) to across-boundary (dar ek st/glos as ry) letter transpositions. Significant transposed-letter similarity effects were found independently of the morphological position of the <b>letter</b> <b>transposition,</b> demonstrating that, in English, morphologically complex whole-word representations can be directly accessed at initial word processing stages. In a third masked primed lexical decision experiment, the same materials were used in the context of stem target priming, and it was found that truly suffixed primes facilitate the recognition of their stem-target (darkest-DARK) to the same extent as pseudosuffixed primes (glossary-GLOSS), which is consistent with theories of early morpho-orthographic decomposition. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for both whole-word access and morphological decomposition at initial stages of visual word recognition and are discussed in the context of a hybrid account. 22 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Two {{key issues}} for models of visual word {{recognition}} are the specification of an input-coding scheme and whether these input-coding schemes vary across orthographies. Here, we report two masked-priming lexical decision experiments that examined whether the ordering {{of the root}} letters {{plays a key role}} in producing transposed-letter effects in Arabic—a language characterized by non-concatenative morphology. In Experiment 1, <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> involved two <b>letters</b> from the root, whereas in Experiment 2, <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> involved one <b>letter</b> from the root and one letter from the word pattern. Results showed a reliable transposedletter priming effect when the ordering of the letters of the root was kept intact (Experiment 2), but not when two root letters were transposed (Experiment 1). These findings support the view that the order of the root letters is allowed only a minimum degree of perceptual noise to avoid the negative impact of activating the “wrong ” root family.

40|$|Abstract This article explores how letter {{position}} coding {{is attained}} during braille reading {{and its implications}} for models of word recognition. When text is presented visually, the reading process easily adjusts to the jumbling of some letters (jugde–judge), with a small cost in reading speed. Two expla-nations have been proposed: One relies on a general mecha-nism of perceptual uncertainty at the visual level, and the other focuses on the activation of an abstract level of representation (i. e., bigrams) that is shared by all orthographic codes. Thus, these explanations make differential predictions about reading in a tactile modality.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that letter identity and letter position are not integral perceptual dimensions (e. g., jugde primes judge in word-recognition experiments). Most comprehensive computational models of visual word recognition (e. g., the interactive activation model, J. L. McClelland & D. E. Rumelhart, 1981, and its successors) assume that the position of each letter within a word is perfectly encoded. Thus, these models are unable to explain the presence of effects of <b>letter</b> <b>transposition</b> (trial–trail), letter migration (beard–bread), repeated letters (moose–mouse), or subset/superset effects (faulty–faculty). The authors extend R. Ratcliff’s (1981) theory of order relations for encoding of letter positions and show that the model can successfully deal with these effects. The basic assumption is that letters in the visual stimulus have distributions over positions so that the representation of one letter will extend into adjacent letter positions. To test the model, the authors conducted a series of forced-choice perceptual identification experiments. The overlap model produced very good fits to the empirical data, and even a simplified 2 -parameter model was capable of producing fits for 104 observed data points with a correlation coefficient of. 91...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the nature of visual spatial attention deficits in adults with developmental dyslexia, using a partial report task with five-letter, digit, and symbol strings. Participants responded by a manual key press to one of nine alternatives, which included other characters in the string, allowing an assessment of position errors as well as intrusion errors. The {{results showed that the}} dyslexic adults performed significantly worse than age-matched controls with letter and digit strings but not with symbol strings. Both groups produced W-shaped serial position functions with letter and digit strings. The dyslexics' deficits with letter string stimuli were limited to position errors, specifically at the string-interior positions 2 and 4. These errors correlated with <b>letter</b> <b>transposition</b> reading errors (e. g., reading slat as "salt"), but not with the Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) task. Overall, these results suggest that the dyslexic adults have a visual spatial attention deficit; however, the deficit does not reflect a reduced span in visual-spatial attention, but a deficit in processing a string of letters in parallel, probably due to difficulty in the coding of letter position. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Most {{computational}} {{models of}} visual word recognition incorporate letter-position coding schemes {{according to which}} transposed-letter (TL) nonwords (e. g., jugde) are only moderately similar to their base words (e. g., judge). Nonetheless, TL nonwords are often misperceived as their base words, especially when the transposition of the letters occurs in middle positions (Chambers, 1979; O’Connor & Forster, 1981). To examine these issues further, we conducted three masked form priming experiments using a lexical decision task. In Experiment 1, form-related primes could be TL-internal nonwords, TLfinal nonwords or the corresponding orthographic controls (e. g., uhser vs. ufner, ushre vs. ushno; the target would be USHER). Masked TL-internal primes produced a significant form priming effect (30 ms) relative to their orthographic control condition, an effect that was greater than the priming effect for TL-final primes (13 ms). Experiments 2 and 3 replicated these findings with {{a different set of}} prime-target conditions and a different set of items, respectively. Taken together, the results show that form priming effects can be found for TL primes relative to the appropriate orthographic control condition and that these effects are larger when the <b>letter</b> <b>transposition</b> is internal to the word than when it involves the final two letters. We discuss the implications of these results for the choice of a letter-position coding scheme in visual word recognition models...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has revealed conflicting results regarding {{the influence of}} <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> during the recognition of morphologically complex words. While some {{studies suggest that the}} disruption of the morpheme boundary through across-boundary transpositions (e. g., darnkess) leads to the absence of masked transposed-letter (TL) priming, other studies have found that TL priming occurs independently of whether or not letters have been transposed across the boundary. We conducted three experiments to test whether the difference between TL- within and TL-across priming is modulated by (a) the transposition of internal versus external letters of the stem (Experiment 1), (b) the overall proportion of affixed trials (Experiment 2), or (c) the relative frequency between prime and target (Experiment 3). The results revealed equal TL-within and TL-across boundary priming across all three experiments, which adds to previous findings suggesting that across-boundary transpositions do not interfere with the recognition of morphologically complex words. 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} for any model of visual word identification is {{the representation of}} the position at which letters are encoded (e. g., calm vs. clam). In this article, we examine whether the orthographic-specific characteristics of a writing system-namely, Thai-shape the process of letter position coding. Thai is an alphabetic script that lacks interword spaces and has an orthographic order that does not necessarily correspond to the phonological order for initial vowels. This implies that the initial letter position coding in Thai needs to be flexible enough that readers can successfully encode the letter positions of words. To compare letter position coding in Thai to that in English, we conducted an experiment that paralleled Experiment 3 in Gomez, Ratcliff, and Perea (Psychological Review, 115, 577 - 600, 2008), including 23 conditions (single-letter replacements, <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions,</b> <b>letter</b> migrations, and a corresponding control). We obtained fits from Gomez et al. 2 ̆ 7 s overlap model, which is a model that has been shown to account for letter position coding in the Roman alphabet across this variety of letter manipulations. The overlap model was found to successfully fit the Thai data. Our results revealed that the position encoding was better for the first letter than {{for the rest of the}} positions in both languages; however, in English the position uncertainty grows as a function of letter order quite abruptly, whereas in Thai it grows gradually.

The major source was an internet meme (a rumour, urban legend or concept propagated via email) suggesting that ILT {{did not affect}} reading performance, provided the initial and final letters in words remained unchanged. An Interrupted Reading Task (IRT) tested {{the concept of the}} original meme. Reading speed, number of words output and output duration were measured by analysing sound files recorded from the IRT. The IRT presented text passages on a computer screen to participants, who immediately began reading them aloud, until a predetermined point at which the experimenter caused the text to disappear from view, replacing it with a random pattern mask, while participants continued reading aloud {{for as long as they}} could. Text passages were designed so that the words following the interruption were either mostly long (3 or more syllables) or short (one syllable). Additionally, passages were either presented as unmodified text or as ILT stimuli, where the internal letters were randomised whilst leaving the initial and final letters intact. Word length was manipulated within subjects, and ILT condition between subjects in a mixed ANOVA. Recorded output represents the contents of the EVS, which relates to short term memory capacity. Significant main effects obtained for both the ILT manipulation (ILT worse) and word length (long words worse) on the measures of number of words output and output duration, as well as a significant interaction showing the ILT further reduced output measures when passages contained longer words. A significant difference in reading speed was evident, with ILT passages read much slower than unmodified text. Data and analyses support both the DRC model of reading (Coltheart et al., 2001) and a global account of word recognition (Frankish & Barnes, 2008) as well as reiterating the robust and wellknown Word Length Effect (WLE; as noted in Baddeley et al., 1975) – however the IRT is a rehearsal-free task and as such the results do not support rehearsal accounts of the WLE.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} that word frequency and predictability affect processing time. These effects change magnitude across tasks, but studies testing this use tasks with different response types (e. g., lexical decision, naming, and fixation time during reading; Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley, 1998), preventing direct comparison. Recently, Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) overcame this problem, comparing fixation times in reading for comprehension and proofreading, {{showing that the}} frequency effect was larger in proofreading than in reading. This result {{could be explained by}} readers exhibiting substantial cognitive flexibility, and qualitatively changing how they process words in the proofreading task in a way that magnifies effects of word frequency. Alternatively, readers may not change word processing so dramatically, and instead may perform more careful identification generally, increasing the magnitude of many word processing effects (e. g., both frequency and predictability). We tested these possibilities with two experiments: subjects read for comprehension and then proofread for spelling errors (<b>letter</b> <b>transpositions)</b> that produce nonwords (e. g., trcak for track as in Kaakinen & Hyönä) or that produce real but unintended words (e. g., trial for trail) to compare how the task changes these effects. Replicating Kaakinen and Hyönä, frequency effects increased during proofreading. However, predictability effects only increased when integration with the sentence context was necessary to detect errors (i. e., when spelling errors produced words that were inappropriate in the sentence; trial for trail).

A glance to the Agamemnon shows that while the analogic principles formulated in Porson’s Preface to Euripides’ Hecuba (1797) were already adopted in his 1795 Aeschylus, only a very small fraction of the great contribution to the knowledge of tragic metre presented in the Supplementum of the second Hecuba (1802) and in the Euripidean editions of 1798 - 1801 may be traced in the Aeschylean edition of 1806 / 1796 (the work on it was probably abandoned after 1800). Nonetheless, Porson introduced relevant novelties in the lyrical sections (some of his colometric suggestions are still adopted in modern editions), proposed many interesting conjectures and inaugurated an approach based on the serious study of precedent editions. The study of some emendations allows to appreciate Porson’s conservative attitude: he always try to save as much as possibile of the transmitted <b>letters,</b> and <b>transposition</b> is favoured, in order to solve the problems without altering the transmitted words...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of parafoveal information on central word processing. This topic impacts on two controversial areas of research: the allocation of attention during reading, and letter processing during word recognition. Researchers {{into the role of}} attention during reading are split into two camps, with some believing that attention is allocated serially to consecutive words and others that it is spread across multiple words in parallel. This debate has been informed by the results of recent experiments that test a key prediction of the parallel processing theory that parafoveal and foveal processing occur concurrently. However, there is a gap in the literature for tightly-controlled experiments to further test this prediction. In contrast, the study of the processing that letters undergo during word recognition has a long history, with many researchers concluding that letter identity is processed only conjointly with letter ‘slot’ position within a word, known as ‘slot-based’ coding. However, recent innovative studies have demonstrated that more word priming is produced from prime letter strings containing <b>letter</b> <b>transpositions</b> than from primes containing letter substitutions, although this work has not been extended to parafoveal letter prime presentations. This thesis will also discuss the neglected subject of how research into these separate topics of text reading and isolated word recognition can be integrated via parafoveal processing. It presents six experiments designed to investigate how our responses to a central word are affected by varying its relationship with simultaneously presented parafoveal information. Experiment 1 introduced the Flanking Letters Lexical Decision task in which a lexical decision was made to words flanked by bigrams either orthographically related or unrelated to the response word; the results indicated that there is parafoveal orthographic priming but did not support the ‘slot-based’ coding theory as letter order was unimportant. Experiments 2 - 4 involved eye-tracking of participants who read sentences containing a boundary change that allowed the presentation of an orthographically related word in parafoveal vision. Experiment 2 demonstrated that an orthographically related word at position n+ 1 reduces first-pass fixations on word n, indicating parallel processing of these words. Experiment 4 replicated this result, and also showed that altering the letter identity of word n+ 1 reduced orthographic priming whereas altering letter order did not, indicating that slot-based coding of letters does not occur during reading. However, Experiment 3 found that an orthographically related word presented at position n- 1 did not prime word n, signifying the influence of reading direction on parafoveal processing. Experiment 5 investigated whether the parallel processing that words undergo during text reading conditions our representations of isolated words; lexical decision times to words flanked by bigrams that formed plausible or implausible contexts did not differ. Lastly, one possible cause of the reading disorder dyslexia is under- or over- processing of parafoveal information. Experiment 6 therefore replicated Experiment 1 including a sample of dyslexia sufferers but found no interaction between reading ability and parafoveal processing. Overall, the results of this thesis lead to the conclusion that there is extensive processing of parafoveal information during both reading (indicating parallel processing) and word recognition (contraindicating slot-based coding), and that underpinning both our reading and word recognition processes is the flexibility of our information-gathering mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Three eye {{movement}} experiments {{were conducted to}} examine the role of letter identity and letter position during reading. Before fixating on a target word within each sentence, readers were provided with a parafoveal preview that differed {{in the amount of}} useful letter identity and letter position information it provided. In Experiments 1 and 2, previews fell into 1 of 5 conditions: (a) identical to the target word, (b) a transposition of 2 internal letters, (c) a substitution of 2 internal <b>letters,</b> (d) a <b>transposition</b> of the 2 final letters, or (e) a substitution of the 2 final letters. In Experiment 3, the authors used a further set of conditions to explore the importance of external letter positions. The findings extend previous work and demonstrate that transposed-letter effects exist in silent reading. These experiments also indicate that letter identity information can be extracted from the parafovea outside of absolute letter position from the first 5 letters of the word to the right of fixation. Finally, the results support the notion that exterior letters play important roles in visual word recognition...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} with beginning typewriting students to investigate the effects of two variables in proofreading straight copy paragraph materials in the independent method of proofreading. One was the influence of repetition which was examined through the use of three different methods of reading. The second was the effect of the use of paper of different colours as background context defined as illuminating, neutral, or unilluminating in terms of whether colour was an aid or hindrance to readability. A comparison of the level of inaccuracy in proofreading was made between seven types of errors. These include: 1. Doubling of small words or of syllables within a word 2. Omission of a letter within a word 3. Omission of one of a pair of doubled <b>letters</b> 4. <b>Transposition</b> of <b>letters</b> within a word 5. Spacing errors 6. Substitution of words 7. Transpositions of words The influence of error location was investigated through an analysis of the mean percentage inaccuracy score by vertical and horizontal quartiles. Method Two independent groups composed of 172 and 171 subjects were randomly selected from beginning typewriting classes in two urban school districts. Each group wrote three criterion tests in which 14 errors (2 each of 7 error types selected) were loaded. One group wrote tests printed on white paper, defined as neutral, while the other completed tests printed on paper of colours defined as illuminating, unilluminating, and neutral respectively. These tests were equivalent in readability level and error load to each other, and to the materials used in beginning typewriting classes. The effect of repetition was investigated by asking subjects to proofread with 0, 1, and 2 repetitions on three tests that were administered on three successive days. Performance was measured in terms of time, total errors, number of errors by type, and the mean percentage of errors by location. The significance of the differences between means was determined through an analysis of variance and F tests at the one and five percent levels. Findings 1. Colour does not affect the proofreading time rate. The use of white or neutral paper produces a higher accuracy level in proofreading over coloured paper in terms of total errors, mean errors by type, and mean percentage of errors by vertical and horizontal location. 2. The proofreading rate recorded in relation to the frequency of repetition in reading was 1. 03 minutes per 100 words for 0 repetition, 1. 05 minutes for 1 repetition, and 1. 33 minutes for 2 repetitions. One repetition yielded the highest level of accuracy in terms of total errors, error type, and vertical and horizontal location of errors. 3. The inaccuracy level recorded in terms of mean total errors was 39...|$|R
