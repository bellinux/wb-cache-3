60|$|In a {{few seconds}} the ship was hove to, and a boat, with a <b>lantern</b> <b>fixed</b> to an oar, was {{plunging}} over the swell {{in the direction of}} the light. Sooner than was expected they came up with it, and a hurrah in the distance told that all was right.|$|R
60|$|A guide {{thoroughly}} {{acquainted with}} the country rode ahead of the party, carrying a <b>lantern</b> <b>fixed</b> {{at the back of}} his saddle. They had, after leaving the chateau, begun to mount the lofty range of hills behind. The road crossing these was a mere track, and they were glad when they began to descend on the other side. They crossed the Clain river some ten miles above Poitiers, a few miles farther forded the Vienne, crossed the Gartempe at a bridge at the village of Montmorillon and, an hour later, halted in a wood, just as daylight was breaking, having ridden nearly fifty miles since leaving the chateau.|$|R
25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas <b>lanterns</b> <b>fixed</b> to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.|$|R
50|$|The glass cable-net wall {{construction}} is notable for several reasons. It is the world’s largest, measuring 90 meters high by 60 meters wide, {{four times the}} size of the cable-net wall at the Time Warner Center in New York. The wall is counterweighted with an 8-story ‘lantern’ structure hanging from four parallel strand cables. The largest of these cables is 275 mm diameter, consisting of 199 parallel strands 15.2 mm diameter. Each strand is made up of seven wires twisted around a central wire. The glass wall is also rigged to these v-shaped cables, reducing the effective distance the wall cables must span. This unique design allows for such a large cable-net wall, and for the lantern. The lantern structure, essentially a building hanging from another building, has no support columns at the ground. It is attached to the cables with v-shaped rocker mechanisms that are designed to maintain tension in a seismic event, keeping <b>lantern</b> <b>fixed</b> in place.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} finally scraped her sides along the rough wooden jetty, Marguerite {{felt as if}} she were {{forcibly}} awakened. She was numb and stiff and thought she must have fallen asleep during the last half hour of the journey. Everything round her was dark. The sky was overcast, and the night seemed unusually sombre. Figures were moving all around her, there was noise and confusion of voices, and a general pushing and shouting which seemed strangely weird in this gloom. Here among the poorer passengers, there had not been thought any necessity for a light, one solitary <b>lantern</b> <b>fixed</b> to a mast only enhanced the intense blackness of everything around. Now and then a face would come within range of this meagre streak of yellow light, looking strangely distorted, with great, elongated shadows across the brow and chin, a grotesque, ghostly apparition which quickly vanished again, scurrying off like some frightened gnome, giving place other forms, other figures all equally grotesque and equally weird.|$|R
5000|$|The {{party was}} sent to the island on July 6, 1904 and a {{temporary}} light was immediately established. A lens <b>lantern</b> with a <b>fixed</b> white light was put up to light the station.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{storekeeper}} knows I hit the Green Lake trail, and we don't {{want the}} cayuse. When we have sorted out the truck we need, he'll make the ranch all right. Light the <b>lantern</b> and we'll <b>fix</b> our packs." ...|$|R
60|$|Santerre {{withdrew from}} the front rank, up {{against the side of}} the cart, where a rough stable <b>lantern</b> had been <b>fixed.</b> He took the paper from the soldier's hand, and, hastily tearing it open, he read it by the dim light of the lantern.|$|R
60|$|Lightships {{are usually}} clumsy-looking, red-painted vessels, having one strong mast amidships, {{with a ball}} at the top, about six feet in diameter, made of light laths. This ball is a very {{conspicuous}} object, and clearly indicates a lightship to the passing vessel during the day. At night a huge lantern traverses on, and is hoisted to nearly the top of, the same mast. It is lighted {{by a number of}} argand lamps with powerful reflectors. Some lightships have two masts, and some three, with a ball and a lantern on each. Some of these <b>lanterns</b> contain <b>fixed,</b> others revolving lights--these differences being for the purpose of indicating to seamen the particular light which they happen to be passing.|$|R
6000|$|The scene shows part of {{the garden}} and a {{verandah}} at the Consular [...] Agent's house. Coloured <b>lanterns</b> are <b>fixed</b> here and there. It is [...] night, and in the distance is seen the blue sky bespangled with [...] stars. At the lack of the verandah are {{the windows of the}} house [...] gaily lit. Within a band is heard playing dance-music. VIOLET is [...] giving a dance. Everyone who appears is magnificently gowned. [...] VIOLET is wearing all her pearls and diamonds. ARTHUR has across [...] his shirt front the broad riband of an order. It {{is the end of the}} [...] evening. Various people are sealed on the verandah, enjoying the [...] coolness. They are MR. and MRS. APPLEBY, CHRISTINA and ARTHUR.|$|R
5000|$|The {{octagonal}} {{cast iron}} <b>lantern</b> displayed a <b>fixed</b> white Fourth Order Fresnel lens light which {{was constructed in}} 1857 with a 39 ft tower which provided a [...] range of visibility. The Lighthouse Board {{was in the process}} of constructing a set of lights up and down the coast, and 13 nautical miles was considered adequate both to keep boats off the island and to navigate from one light to the next.|$|R
60|$|The figure neither spoke nor stirred. Yuba Bill walked wrathfully {{toward it}} {{and turned the}} eye of his coach-lantern upon its face. It was a man's face, prematurely old and wrinkled, with very large eyes, {{in which there was}} that {{expression}} of perfectly gratuitous solemnity which I had sometimes seen in an owl's. The large eyes wandered from Bill's face to the <b>lantern,</b> and finally <b>fixed</b> their gaze on that luminous object without further recognition.|$|R
60|$|These words, heartily uttered, put superstitious fears {{to flight}} at once. The men threw off their jackets; {{the boat was}} lowered, {{and in a few}} minutes was pulling about and searching in all directions. Our hero {{was one of the first}} to leap into her, and he pulled the bow oar. For some time they rowed about in vain. The night was {{intensely}} dark, and the cry was not repeated, so that they had nothing to guide them in their movements. A <b>lantern</b> was <b>fixed</b> in the ship half way up the mizzen rigging, but the lantern in the boat was concealed until the moment when it should be required, because it is easier for men to distinguish surrounding objects in comparative darkness than when a light is glaring near them. Presently Will Osten saw a dark object like a small canoe right ahead of the boat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} used a {{rear projection}} display, showing both a map overlay from a <b>fixed</b> <b>lantern</b> slide and dynamically updated {{data from a}} mechanical plotter. The mechanism for etching the slide is somewhat similar to an Etch A Sketch. The display can draw lines and characters, but cannot erase them individually. The unit {{was used in the}} IBM 473L Command and Control System's Large Panel Display Subsystem (e.g., at the National Military Command Center and the Alternate Military Command Center). Advertised in 1961 by Temco Aircraft Corp. (already a subsidiary of Ling-Temco Electronics, Inc.), the system used [...] "a coated slide...one inch square" [...] that was scribed [...] "by a moving stylus" [...] to make traces (e.g., for paths of attacking bombers). The unit was used by the Strategic Air Command, in the Marine Technical Data System and at the Air Force Command Post, Mount Weather, Pacific Missile Range, Point Mugu Calif.; the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico; the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the Naval Research Laboratory. NORAD's Combined Operations Center at the Chidlaw Building and BMEWS Central Computer and Display Facility at Ent AFB used Iconorama, and in 1971 an Iconorama was still being used by NORAD for BMEWS.|$|R
50|$|The tercentenary of Champlain's {{explorations of}} the lake {{provided}} the occasion for celebrations marking the event, and commissions from New York and Vermont, {{put in charge of}} the festivities, decided to erect a monument. A suggestion in a newspaper prompted the notion to convert an existing lighthouse, and after some consideration of other sites, the Crown Point Light was chosen. The stone sheath of the tower was stripped away, leaving the brick spiral staircase sitting on the foundation. A new tower was constructed on and around this, consisting of a short tapered base, a ring of eight Doric columns, an elaborately carved cornice and parapet, and a new lantern atop the whole. On the side facing the lake, a projection from the base supported a monumental bronze designed by Carl Augustus Heber and cast at the Roman Bronze Works consisting of Champlain accompanied by one fellow Frenchman and one Huron native. The French government sent a plaque by Auguste Rodin which was later placed below the other sculpture. A broad staircase led down to a pier projecting into the lake. A fifth order Fresnel lens continued to shine in the <b>lantern</b> giving a <b>fixed</b> white light, and the old keeper's house remained in place, attached to the new tower by a short passageway. The memorial was dedicated on July 5, 1912 at a ceremony presided over by Governors John Abner Mead of Vermont and John Adams Dix of New York.|$|R
50|$|Fleming House (1898) is a two-storeyed {{building}} {{located at}} the southeastern corner of the cricket oval, amongst lawns and mature trees. It is constructed of light-coloured brick with narrow bands of red bricks at sill level on both floors and at the upper floor-line. It has a hipped roof with boxed-in eaves and decorative timber brackets. A detached bathroom building (1920) is centrally located on the southern elevation; it has a pyramid roof with a raised central roof lantern and a lean-to addition at the rear with a brick chimney. There is a verandah {{on the ground floor}} on the northern side, overlooking the cricket oval. A centrally-located metal staircase dominates this elevation of the building. Narrow casement windows with concrete sills and lintels are found on all elevations.Gladstone House, Jenner House and Kelsey House (all 1936) are located to the east of Fleming House and are nearly identical in form, scale and detail. Like Fleming House, these buildings are situated to overlook the cricket oval. The buildings are all single-storeyed brick buildings with unusual crab-like plan-forms, set within gardens enclosed with low wire fences. The gardens are mostly lawn with mature trees such as Poincianas. The central portion of each building comprises a large dining/day room with service facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms to the rear. The four wings of each building contain dormitories and single rooms. Each of the dining rooms has a large roof <b>lantern</b> with <b>fixed</b> glass panels that allow natural light to penetrate the room. Each of the buildings has terracotta tiled roofs and large casement windows which have aluminium security screens fitted on the outside.Lewis House, McDonnell House and Noble House (all 1915) are ward buildings of similar design, located along Barrett Drive. On the eastern side the buildings overlook lawns and the cricket oval. A service road runs along the western side and the surroundings of the buildings are paved in concrete with a raised garden strip containing mature trees between the buildings and Barrett Drive. Lewis House is situated between Kelsey House and McDonnell House and is a substantial two-storeyed rendered masonry building with a terracotta-tiled roof. It has gabled roofs with parapetted gable ends and subtle quoins on the upper floor. The southern elevation has a projecting wing with pyramid-roofed pavilions at each corner and small square windows. The rest of the building has large casement windows throughout and is smooth rendered to sill height on the second floor and roughcast above. A short verandah with vertical timber louvres is located {{on the ground floor of}} the eastern elevation. McDonnell House is situated between Lewis House and Noble House. It is also two-storeyed and constructed of masonry but is more rectangular in plan with three short wings projecting on the western elevation. It has a large gabled roof and gabled roofs on the western wings, all of which have overhanging eaves. The roof is clad in dark concrete tiles and the building is rendered smooth up to sill height on the second floor, above which it is roughcast. There are two ground floor verandahs on the eastern elevation overlooking the cricket oval, either side of a central projecting gable. Noble House is almost identical to Lewis House but a concrete tiled roof has replaced the terracotta roof and it has a longer verandah on the ground floor on the eastern elevation.|$|R
