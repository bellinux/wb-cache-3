25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> of the cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, {{particularly if the}} angle of the bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E
40|$|We study {{invasion}} speeds in the Lotka-Volterra competition model {{when the}} rate of diffusion of one species is small. Our main result is {{the construction of the}} selected front and a rigorous asymptotic approximation of its propagation speed, valid to second order. We use techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory and geometric desingularization. The main challenge arises from the slow passage through a saddle-node bifurcation. From a perspective of <b>linear</b> versus nonlinear <b>speed</b> selection, this front provides an interesting example as the propagation speed is slower than the <b>linear</b> spreading <b>speed.</b> However, our front shares many characteristics with pushed fronts that arise when the influence of nonlinearity leads to faster than <b>linear</b> <b>speeds</b> of propagation. We show that this {{is a result of the}} <b>linear</b> spreading <b>speed</b> arising as a simple pole of the resolvent instead of as a branch pole. Using the pointwise Green’s function, we show that this pole poses no a priori obstacle to marginal stability of the nonlinear traveling front, thus explaining how nonlinear systems can exhibit slower spreading that their linearization in a robust fashion.

25|$|Helical {{symmetry}} is {{the kind}} of symmetry seen in such everyday objects as springs, Slinky toys, drill bits, and augers. The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space that results from rotating an object at a constant angular speed while simultaneously translating at a constant <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> along its axis of rotation. At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a coiling angle that helps define the properties of the traced helix. When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation is speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°.|$|E

50|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>speed</b> is the {{distance}} travelled {{per unit of}} time, while tangential speed (or tangential velocity) is the <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> of something moving along a circular path. A point on the outside edge of a merry-go-round or turntable travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance {{in the same time}} means a greater speed, and so <b>linear</b> <b>speed</b> is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as tangential speed because the direction of motion is tangent to the circumference of the circle.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the spiral tooth over the straight tooth is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons straight bevel gears are generally limited to use at <b>linear</b> <b>speeds</b> less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} <b>speeds</b> of <b>linear</b> {{waves in}} gas-solid suspensions depend strongly on the solids volume fraction and the wave frequency. The latter {{is due to}} gas-solid momentum transfer and allows a simple test on filtered gas-solid momentum transfer models. Such models may predict <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> different from those obtained with the nonfiltered model at wave frequencies higher than the filter frequency, but not at wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency. For the filtered drag, an effective drag coefficient approach is shown to alter the <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> in the entire wave frequency range, independent of the applied effective drag coefficient. Furthermore, as the effective drag coefficient decreases, the high frequency <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> are gradually introduced at lower wave frequencies. For the filtered momentum transfer due to {{the correlation between the}} solids volume fraction and the gas phase pressure gradient, the behavior of an apparent added mass closure model and an apparent history force closure model are investigated. An apparent added mass introduces the filter frequency <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> to frequencies higher than the filter frequency. The <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> for wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency are, however, not altered. Furthermore, an apparent added mass introduces no intrinsic wave frequency dependence in the <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds,</b> in agreement with its source term in the non-filtered model. Hence, the frequency dependence of the <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> at frequencies lower than the filter frequency is still to be provided by a drag type term. As such, the behavior introduced by an apparent added mass is acceptable for filtered models. Also, to a certain extent, an apparent added mass can restore the <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speed</b> behavior at wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency altered by an effective drag coefficient approach. The reformulation of the apparent added mass in terms of an apparent distribution of the filtered gas phase pressure gradient over the phases and an apparent (effective) drag force is investigated. An apparent history force introduces intrinsic wave frequency dependence in the <b>linear</b> wave propagation <b>speeds</b> and alters the latter from the low wave frequencies on. As such, the behavior introduced by an apparent history force is unacceptable for filtered models, (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
