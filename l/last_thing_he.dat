5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E

25|$|Jude McGregor: Callum's older brother, {{who holds}} a grudge against Sephy, who he {{believes}} {{to be responsible for}} his brother's death. He hates all crosses but becomes romantically inclined towards a cross, Cara, to use her for her money. Despite his best efforts, he starts to have genuine feelings for Cara, but the resultant confusion and his conflicting emotions ultimately prove too much. He ends up beating her to death and taking all her money. He later attempts to use Callie Rose to get back at Sephy, by training her to be a terrorist, but his plan backfires when Jasmine takes the bomb and activates it in his hotel room. Before he is killed in the bomb blast, he finally admits his feelings for Cara to himself, as she is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> sees before he is killed.|$|E

At the end of 5.01 [...] "Veritas", he finally arrests Joe and tells him that he made him get very [...] "pissed off".|$|R
25|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem in 597BCE {{led to the}} city being {{overcome}} by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together {{with most of the}} aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so that that would be the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Wilson won the Republican {{primary in}} California {{to replace the}} {{retiring}} U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa. Wilson's Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor Jerry Brown. Wilson {{was known as a}} fiscal conservative who supported Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wanted to see was one of his home state's U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the Armenian vote in the California governor's race between George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley. Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas. The Deukmejian voters likely also voted for Wilson for senator.|$|E

He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman {{came up to me}} and said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never felt the same way about it after that.' ...|$|E

50|$|Rick Smith came up {{with the}} title of the album through his father, {{which was one of the}} <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said before he died. Karl Hyde in an {{interview}} said that Rick's mother's name is Barbara and said that she was fearful of the future without him and that's when his father said to her that quote that would then become the title for the album. The artwork was created by art design collective group Tomato.|$|R

500|$|Although {{the weather}} was poor, with heavy rain and fog, and despite warnings, the plane took off. Four miles (6.4km) from their {{destination}} at Truax Field in Madison, the pilot radioed for permission to land. Shortly thereafter, the plane crashed into Lake Monona. Bar-Kays member Ben Cauley, the accident's only survivor, was sleeping shortly before the accident. He woke just before impact to see bandmate Phalon Jones look out a window and exclaim, [...] "Oh, no!" [...] Cauley said the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> remembered before the crash was unbuckling his seat belt. He then found himself in frigid water, grasping a seat cushion to keep afloat. A non-swimmer, {{he was unable to}} rescue the others. The cause of the crash was never determined. James Brown claimed in his autobiography The Godfather of Soul that he had warned Redding not to fly in the plane.|$|E
500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E

60|$|I recall {{these things}} {{with a certain}} degree of feeling, because not less than a week later this poor fellow was {{discovered}} by one of our company swinging from the crosstree of the tent, a ghastly corpse. There was something inexplicable in the deed. No one could account for it. He seemed not to be a man of deep feeling. And one of the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> uttered in my hearing was a coarse jest which I did not like and to which I made no reply.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Parasite", Bennet is {{questioned}} by Thompson; {{he claims that}} the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as {{he told her to}} do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to [...] "clean up" [...] Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that they have no idea what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. [...] "Sandra" [...] then transforms back into Candice, {{and other members of the}} Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson did {{not want}} to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did he want to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win. [...] He also {{personally}} despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called [...] "65 Power-Up", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.|$|E

He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean {{the things he said}} then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E

Among the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> made {{while he was still}} in Italy, {{at the end of the}} Eighties and at beginning of the Nineties, there are the so-called Paperolimpiadi (a long story about the 1988 Seoul Olympic games) and some strip stories, the same kind of stories that he loved when he was a child. One of these, Topolino e l'enigma di Brigaboom (1989) was partially based on Brigadoon (1954).|$|R
6000|$|David did {{not long}} survive his son. He {{appointed}} his eldest grandchild, Malcolm, to succeed him, {{and set his}} affairs in order, redoubling all his pious and charitable acts.

Put me in possession of that whereof the inhabitants are all kings." [...] He was soon after found dead, in the attitude of devotion.

Author Stephen Greenblatt in Will in the World, suggests that as Shakespeare lay dying, [...] "he tried to forget his wife and then remembered her with the second-best bed. And when he thought of the afterlife, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wanted was to be mingled with the woman he married. There are four lines carved in [...] gravestone in the chancel of Stratford Church: Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare, To digg the dust encloased heare: Bleste be ye man y't spares thes stones, And curst be he y't moves my bones.

2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the {{pay-per-view}} was for the Raw brand, with Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Chris Benoit feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H was the three time reigning World Champion {{heading into the}} WrestleMania XX event, with {{the origins of the}} rivalry beginning on the December 29, 2003 episode of Raw, when Michaels challenged Triple H for the World Title in Michaels' hometown of San Antonio, Texas. It looked as though Michaels was going to win his fifth World Title over Triple H, the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff came in to the ring at the last minute and made the pinfall, counting to three for what appeared to be Michaels winning the World Heavyweight title. However, as Shawn's shoulders were on the mat {{at the same time as}} Triple H's, the match was declared a draw and Triple H would retain the championship. On January 25, at the Royal Rumble event, Triple H and Michaels faced each other again in a Last Man Standing match for the title, which resulted in a draw, and, as a result, Triple H retained the title, leaving question about who is the better of the two. At the same event, during the Royal Rumble match, SmackDown!'s Benoit won the contest by last eliminating The Big Show. On the following night, Michaels and Triple H were involved in an in-ring confrontation when Raw's authority figure (referred to as the [...] "Sheriff"), Steve Austin, made his way to the ring. As he stated that, although Michaels should have a rematch, he had to [...] "enforce the law" [...] and that even though the Royal Rumble rules gave the winner of the match a shot at [...] "the (world) championship", there was not any specification as to which world title that was. Benoit, who at the time was a member of SmackDown, then came to the ring and said he was taking advantage of that loophole and challenging Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX. On the February 9 episode of Raw, a contract signing took place between Benoit and World Champion, Triple H. As Triple H signed his name on the paper, Michaels came out to inform Benoit that the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do is rain on his parade. He then stated that he more than anybody can respect Benoit's effort to win the Royal Rumble match and earning a World title shot but suggested that Benoit could've stayed on SmackDown to take care of business while Michaels, himself, was trying to finish his 10-year issue with Triple H on behalf of the Raw brand. Benoit refused to relinquish his guaranteed title shot, resulting in Michaels superkicking Benoit and signing the contract himself for the WrestleMania match. After the two men wrestled a match marred by interference from the champion the next week, Austin decided to make Triple H's title defense a Triple threat match. On March 1, after Michaels and Benoit lost to Randy Orton and Batista, Triple H's stablemates in Evolution, the entire group attacked Michaels and Benoit, ending with Triple H nailing them with the Pedigree and rubbing his World title belt into their faces while they were laying motionless in the ring.|$|E
