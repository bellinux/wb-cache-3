5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E

5000|$|The value {{placed on}} {{relations}} to others defining the self relates {{closely to the}} concept of [...] "face". Face is lost when one behaves badly in class.

[...] Not incidentally, Wen and Clement identify a cultural trait that places value on resisting [...] "outsider culture", which may result in additional difficulty in adapting to different norms of verbal participation (p. 21-22).|$|R
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk.

5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succumb {{to many of the}} same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle.
