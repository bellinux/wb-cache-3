40|$|Abstract. A ring {{signature}} {{scheme is}} a group signature scheme with no group manager to setup a group or revoke a signer. A linkable ring signature, introduced by Liu, et al. [20], additionally allows anyone to determine if two ring signatures are signed by the same group member (a. k. a. they are linked). In this paper, we present the first separable linkable ring signature scheme, which also supports an efficient thresholding option. We also present the security model and reduce the security of our scheme to well-known hardness assumptions. In particular, we introduce the security notions of accusatory linkability and non-slanderability to linkable ring signatures. Our scheme supports “event-oriented ” <b>linking.</b> <b>Applications</b> to such linking criterion is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Android apps {{frequently}} incorporate third-party libraries {{that contain}} native code; {{this not only}} facilitates rapid application development and distribution, but also provides new ways to generate revenue. As a matter of fact, one in two apps in Google Play are linked with a library providing ad network services. However, <b>linking</b> <b>applications</b> with third-party code can have severe security implications: malicious libraries written in native code can exfiltrate sensitive information from a running app, or completely modify the execution runtime, since all native code is mapped inside the same address space with the execution environment, namely the Dalvik/ART VM. We propose NaClDroid, a framework that addresses these problems, while still allowing apps to include third-party code. NaClDroidprevents malicious native-code libraries from hijacking Android applications using Software Fault Isolation. More specifically, we place all native code in a Native Client sandbox that prevents unconstrained reads, or writes, inside the process address space. NaClDroidhas little overhead; for native code running inside the NaCl sandbox the slowdown is less than 10 % on average...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{precondition for}} resource redeployment is that firms {{are aware of}} the commercial applications for which their resources can be used. We take an inventing-firm perspective and ask: how many new commercial applications will a firm associate with an existing technological invention? We note that both technological and organizational characteristics determine the number of distinct applications firms consider feasible for a given technological invention. In particular, we suggest that inherently fungible technologies, that is, technologies that have a broad impact on other technological fields (highly general technologies), will be associated with a larger set of commercial applications. We also suggest that <b>linking</b> <b>applications</b> to an inherently general technology can be challenging when the technology is already embedded in organizational (commercial) routines. Proprietary data from an online marketplace allow us to investigate the applications firms consider feasible for their technological inventions. In line with extant work, a firm assigns a greater number of applications to more general technologies. As expected, however, this relationship is shaped by how the technology is embedded within the organization. Our results have implications for redeployment as firms may face challenges in the initial step of redeployment when fungible resources need to be linked to emerging market opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{explosive}} growth of the Web has come a great increase in on-line scholarly literature. More and moNot only is Web retrieval usually faster than a walk to the library, but the information obtained from the Web is generally more current than what appears in printed publications. The increasing proportion of on-line scholarly literature {{makes it possible to}} implement functionality desirable to all researchers [...] the ability to access cited documents immediately from the citing paper. Implementing this direct access is called "reference linking". While many authors insert explicit hyperlinks into their papers to support reference linking, {{it is by no means}} a universal practice. The approach taken by the Digital Library Research Group at Cornell employs "value-added surrogates" as a generalizable mechanism for providing reference-linking behavior in Web documents. Given the URL of an on-line document, a surrogate object is constructed for that paper, which then processes document's content to extract reference linking data. The surrogate then exposes the reference linking data through a well-defined API, permitting the construction of reference linking services by external clients. We present two examples of the many possible reference <b>linking</b> <b>applications</b> buildable on this API. We also describe a metric that measures the API's performance; currently we are (automatically) extracting reference linking information from HTML papers with more than 8...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} six papers {{dealing with}} implementations and techniques for linking computer-aided applications for design and analysis into a concurrent engineering environment. Each paper {{deals with a}} part of the environment - together they constitute an integrated design system for concurrent engineering. Concurrent engineering requires applications across all functions within the company to share and communicate information. The applications used in the product development process need to be linked together. This thesis examines the linking, of applications using databases. In Papers A, B, C, D and F this linking is studied using a relational database. In Paper E an object-oriented database is investigated. Using database technology proved to be an efficient way of <b>linking</b> <b>applications</b> together. In Papers A, C, D and E databases for geometric data, measurement instructions, mechanical systems, computational fluid dynamic and finite element data have been developed as part of a general concurrent engineering environment. In Papers B, E and F the general concurrent engineering environment has successfully been used for performing simulations of manufacturing processes and product performance as well as the verification of the shape of products manufactured by hot isostatic pressing. Solid models have been used throughout all the work as the foundation for the product definition. The solid models can be used by many downstream functions and provide an efficient base for the geometric definition and associated information such as analysis models and probe paths for coordinate measurement inspections.

40|$|Abstract Compilers for {{polymorphic}} languages can use runtime type in-spection {{to support}} advanced implementation {{techniques such as}} tagless garbage collection, polymorphic marshalling, and flatteneddata structures. Intensional type analysis is a type-theoretic framework for expressing and certifying such type-analyzing computa-tions. Unfortunately, existing approaches to intensional analysis do not work well on types with universal, existential, or fixpointquantifiers. This {{makes it impossible to}} code applications such as garbage collection, persistency, or marshalling which must be ableto examine the type of any runtime value. We present a typed intermediate language that supports fullyreflexive intensional type analysis. By fully reflexive, we mean that type-analyzing operations are applicable to the type of any runtimevalue in the language. In particular, we provide both type-level and term-level constructs for analyzing quantified types. Our systemsupports structural induction on quantified types yet type checking remains decidable. We show how to use reflexive type analysis tosupport type-safe marshalling and how to generate certified typeanalyzing object code. Keywords: certified code, runtime type dispatch, typed intermediate language. 1 Introduction Runtime type analysis is used extensively in various applicationsand programming situations. Runtime services such as garbage collection and dynamic <b>linking,</b> <b>applications</b> such as marshalling andpickling, type-safe persistent programming, and unboxing implementations of polymorphic languages all analyze types to variousdegrees at runtime. Most existing compilers use untyped intermediate languages for compilation; therefore, they support runtime typeinspection in a type-unsafe manner. In this paper, we present a statically typed intermediate language that allows runtime type analy-sis to be coded within the language. This allows us to leverage the power of dynamically typed languages, yet retain the advantages ofstatic type checking...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} tools for cloud computing—processor and network virtualization—make {{it difficult to}} achieve dependability, {{both in terms of}} real time operations and fault tolerance. Virtualization multiplexes virtual resources onto physical ones, typically by time division or statistical multiplexing. Time, in the virtual machine, is therefore as virtual as the machine itself. And fault tolerance is difficult to achieve when redundancy and independent failure in the virtual environment do not necessarily map to those properties in the physical environment. Virtualization adds a level of indirection that creates overhead, and makes it all but impossible to achieve predictable performance. Osprey uses an alternative to virtualization that achieves the same goals of scalability and flexibility but carries neither the overhead of virtualization, nor the restrictions on dependability. The result is a programming environment that achieves most of the compatibility offered by traditional virtualization efforts and provides much better and much more predictable performance. One technique we use is called Library OS, which stems from high-performance computing. The technique consists of <b>linking</b> <b>applications</b> with a library that implements most services normally provided by the operating system, creating an application that can run practically stand alone, or at least with a very minimal operating system. The Library OS approach moves the boundary between application and operating system down to a level where interactions with the operating system consist of sending/receiving messages (e. g., network packets) and scheduling resources (processor, memory, network bandwidth, and device access). These interactions, as we demonstrate, form a relatively weak bond between an application and the particular instance of the operating system on which it runs—one that can be broken and re-established elsewhere. In fact, we make sure this is the case. Legacy applications that cannot be recompiled or relinked can make use of a Library OS server that runs as a tandem process along with the legacy application processes. System calls from the legacy process are catapulted into the Library OS server which executes them. Applications can still migrate, taking their server process along with them...|$|E
