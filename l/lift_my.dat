[...] 'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't <b>lift</b> <b>my</b> left arm higher than this'— and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference?

500|$|Her {{selection}} {{at the age}} of 16 in late 2006 as wicket-keeper for Barker College First XI, {{the first}} time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools' cricket competition in New South Wales, drew press commentary from various sources. This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled [...] "Save Barker Cricket Now" [...] in the school community attacking the selection as a [...] "disgrace" [...] and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team. The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as [...] "gutless" [...] and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit. Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers. In 2010, she reflected [...] "I'd do it all again...I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped <b>lift</b> <b>my</b> skills and tighten my technique." [...] Both she and Australian teammate Ellyse Perry have publicly advocated girls playing against boys.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would <b>lift</b> <b>my</b> voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.|$|E

As in the case where I erect a building, and when the timber is being lifted a piece of it falls upon the house of my {{neighbor}} and bruises his house, he will have a good action, and that, although the erection of my house was lawful and the timber fell without my intent. Similarly, if a man commits an assault upon me and I cannot avoid him if he wants to beat me, and I <b>lift</b> <b>my</b> stick in self-defense in order to prevent him, and there is a man behind me, although my lifting my stick was lawful to defend myself and I injured him without intent [...]" ...|$|E
