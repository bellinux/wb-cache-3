60|$|We rose {{next morning}} with nipped feet and hands, which {{a cup of}} hot coffee, 'with,' speedily corrected, and were en route at 4.30 A.M. Formerly animals were left at the lower estancia; now they are readily taken on to Alta Vista. My wife rode a sure-footed black nag, I a mule which was perfect whilst the foot-long <b>lever</b> <b>acting</b> curb lay loose on its neck. Returning, we were amazed at the places they had passed during the moonless night.|$|E

5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key lifts and the striking hammer, Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this <b>lever</b> <b>acting</b> directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable screw mounted underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|E
40|$|The body (3) {{is turned}} by a lever, and the tilting shaft (9) above {{it has two}} levers (6, 7) at one end. The wheel (5) rolls in a guide (4) between the <b>levers,</b> <b>acting</b> on them so as to tilt the shaft (9). The {{movements}} of shaft and body are independent of each other. The levers can be detachable from the shaft, and body it and the body can be positively turned, their rotation in each case being limited to 35 degrees. USE - Discharges goods against travel direction, allowing widely varying discharge speed and acceleration in both directions...|$|R
50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using <b>levers</b> <b>acting</b> on the valve tappet rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using <b>levers</b> <b>acting</b> on the valve tappet rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main line}} had a {{generally}} falling gradient, {{and it was}} steep enough to require efficient braking. The wagon structure was founded on two main beams 9 feet (2.743 m) long, with the bed formed of 2½ inch (64 mm) planking armoured with longitudinal iron strips. The wheels were cast iron, 29 inches (737 mm) diameter with 4½ inch (114 mm) treads; the wheel treads were conical [...] "so that the diameter close to the flange is 29¾ inches" [...] (756 mm) [...] The axles were 41½ inches (1,054 mm) apart. The brakes were cast iron and fixed to a long wooden <b>lever,</b> <b>acting</b> on both wheels on the same side. The couplings were connecting links 15 inches (381 mm) long.|$|E
50|$|The {{master and}} slave pendulums were linked {{together}} in a feedback loop which kept the slave synchronized with the master. The slave clock had a mechanical escapement using a 15-tooth count wheel which was moved forward each right-hand pendulum swing by a pawl attached to the pendulum. Every 15 oscillations (30 seconds), this released a gravity lever which gave the slave pendulum a push. This simultaneously closed a switch which reset the gravity lever and sent a pulse of current to an electromagnet which released a second gravity lever in the master unit to give the master pendulum a push. The impulse {{was provided by the}} weight of the gravity <b>lever</b> (<b>acting</b> as a remontoire) rolling off a wheel attached to the pendulum, this mechanism ensuring that the pendulum received an identical impulse, at precisely the same part of its stroke, every 30 seconds. The falling gravity lever closed another pair of contacts which reset the lever and provided an electrical pulse back to the slave unit.|$|E
40|$|Using {{diffraction}} {{x-ray tubes}} (2 kW) as the excitation source in Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (TXRF) results in less photon flux on the sample {{compared to the}} excitation with rotating anode tubes (18 kW) or synchrotron radiation. An efficient way of increasing the photon flux on the sample is the insertion of x-ray optical elements in the primary beam path. In this experiment a mechanically bent W/C multilayer monochromator on a Sisubstrate of 0. 5 mm thickness was used, leading {{to an increase in}} intensity of a factor 2 to 3 (comparable to a 4 or 6 kW x-ray tube). A flat multilayer monochromator offers the advantage of a reduction in spectral background {{due to the fact that}} only monoenergetic photons arrive on the sample to cause scattered radiation but it leads to losses in intensity because of the sharp angular acceptance of the Bragg equation. The basic idea is that the bending curve approaches a logarithmic spiral having a constant angle between the radius of the spiral and the respective tangent at each point. This curvature was achieved by fixing one end of the 70 mm long multilayer mechanically tight. In a distance of 40 mm of the remaining length the bending was performed by applying a transversal force and a torque on this free end of the multilayer. This was done by one micrometer screw pressing against the rear side of the multilayer and by a second micrometer producing the torque by means of a simple <b>lever</b> <b>acting</b> at the free end of the multilayer. The result of bending is a large angular acceptance to fulfill the Bragg equation. The calculations leading to values for the mechanical force and torque involved to produce the curvature as well as the scheme of the experimental set-up and spectra comparing the effects of bending the multilayer with the straight multilayer are presented.

50|$|All road wheels {{as well as}} the easily {{adjusted}} {{steering gear}} and the steering-heads have ball-bearings. There is no mention of suspension or braking systems. The omission of a mention of brakes was remedied in the advertisement displayed below - there was a pedal operated brake on the countershaft and a hand operated <b>lever</b> on internal <b>acting</b> brakes on the back wheels.|$|R
50|$|When {{the correct}} key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, {{activating}} a latch or sliding bolt, {{or it may}} itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double <b>acting</b> <b>lever</b> lock, the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.|$|R
50|$|The lever tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double <b>acting</b> <b>lever</b> lock {{required}} the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
40|$|An ongoing {{prospective}} study to investigate failing metal-on-metal hip prostheses was commenced at our centre in 2008. We {{report on the}} results of the analysis of the first consecutive 126 failed mated total hip prostheses from a single manufacturer. Methods Analysis was carried out using highly accurate coordinate measuring to calculate volumetric and linear rates of the articular bearing surfaces and also the surfaces of the taper junctions. The relationship between taper wear rates and a number of variables, including bearing diameter and orientation of the acetabular component, was investigated. Results The measured rates of wear and distribution of material loss from the taper surfaces appeared to show that the primary factor leading to taper failure is the increased <b>lever</b> arm <b>acting</b> on this junction in contemporary large-diameter metal-on-metal hip replacements. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that varus stems, laterally engaging taper systems and larger head diameters all contribute to taper failure...|$|R
