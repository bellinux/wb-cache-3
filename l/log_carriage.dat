50|$|The {{sawmilling}} area, {{which includes}} timber storage/loading and log working sections, is {{level with the}} driveway {{on the west side}} and has an elevated platform to the east. It is sheltered by a metal trussed skillion roof and houses a <b>log</b> <b>carriage</b> and breakdown saw sheltered by a low narrow barrel roof to the upper level. The <b>log</b> <b>carriage</b> and saw are operational and the carriage has rails and a trolley. A small timber shed houses the recently introduced four-sider machine.|$|E
50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} log diameter, head saws can cut a log at speeds ranging from 1 to 300 feet per minute. Generally, <b>log</b> <b>carriage</b> speeds are {{adjustable}} for optimal performance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the milling of timber and the {{manufacture}} of timber products was an integral component of the North Coast timber industry, a major industry for Queensland. Alfredson's Joinery complex is a rare surviving example of the pre-World War II era of sawmilling and joinery operations on the North Coast, and is also a rare example of a post-World War II pre-cut house workshop. The lathe and <b>log</b> <b>carriage</b> are important as rare surviving equipment from those operations.|$|E
50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the wind shaft drives the crank wheel with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> back to their starting position.|$|R
50|$|De Otter is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 19.50 m. They are carried on Azobé wooden windshaft made by Saendijck in 1996. The function of the brake wheel is split between two wheels, one wheel with a flat outer rim for the brake blocks to work on and another wheel with 71 radial cogs driving the lantern wheel with 29 staves on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. Connecting rods from the three cranks drive the three wooden sawing frames. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> back to their starting position.|$|R
50|$|De Eenhoorn is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four sawing frames, one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra sawing frame. The rearmost sawing frame was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> back to their starting position.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 Alan Guymer {{operates}} a traditional joinery workshop {{on the former}} pre-cut house workshop (underneath and {{to the south of}} the former joinery), although his main business is building and demolition. The current machinery within and under the pre-cut house workshop, and most of the machinery in the sawmill section, was introduced by Alan. An original <b>log</b> <b>carriage</b> and its metal rails is still in situ in the rear sawmill shed, and original timber rails survive running north-south along the floor of the pre-cut house workshop, along with some metal gantry rails running east-west across the ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|The defences of York {{consisted}} of a fort a short distance west of the town, with the nearby [...] "Government House Battery" [...] mounting two 12-pounder guns. A mile west was the crude [...] "Western Battery", with two obsolete 18-pounder guns. (These weapons were veterans of earlier wars and had been disabled by having their trunnions removed, but they were fixed to crude <b>log</b> <b>carriages</b> and could still be fired.) Further west were the ruins of Fort Rouillé and another disused fortification, the [...] "Half Moon Battery", neither of which was in use. Major General Sheaffe, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, was present at York to transact public business. He had under his command only four companies of regulars. The Militia was ordered to assemble, but only 300 of the 1st and 3rd York Regiments could be mustered at short notice. There were also about 40 to 50 natives (Mississaugas and Ojibwa) in the area.|$|R
50|$|Murrays Road also {{provided}} access to timber <b>carriage.</b> <b>Logs</b> {{were brought in}} by bullock cart from the surrounding area and transported to sawmills up the Logan River. This was done by a rafting system (steamers) which would travel up Slacks Creek. Earth cuttings can still {{be seen in the}} hill {{to the side of the}} road where logs were rolled down for removal. Rafting Court is a small a street off Murrays Road which is named to remember the important role the timber distribution point had in supplying timber to the developing area.|$|R
40|$|A {{lifetime}} {{resident of}} Santa Cruz County, Michael Bergazzi spent {{the years between}} 1901 and 1922 working in almost every phase of redwood lumbering, both in the mills and in the woods. For the major portion of his career he was a sawyer, but he also worked as a faller, peeler, bucker, donkey rigger, <b>log</b> dogger, and <b>carriage</b> setter. He described the many procedures involved in lumbering and also commented {{on the life of}} a lumberman [...] the wages, hours and working conditions. In {{the latter part of the}} manuscript he discussed Santa Cruz during the early years of the twentieth century...|$|R
50|$|Pegues Place, {{also known}} as the Claudius Pegues House, is a {{historic}} home located near Wallace, Marlboro County, South Carolina. It was built about 1770, and is a two-story Georgian white frame house with a one-story, full façade porch. A wing was added in the late-19th century. Also on the property are contributing barns, a cotton gin, wash house, <b>log</b> smoke house, <b>carriage</b> house, and greenhouse. On May 3, 1781 it was the site of the only agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war signed by Lt. Col. Edward Carrington (for Gen. Nathanael Greene) and Capt. Frederick Cornwallis (for Gen. Earl Cornwallis).|$|R
40|$|Western hemlock and Sitka spruce are {{relatively}} thin- barked species and susceptible to damage during thinning operations. Damage to the wood allows decay-causing fungi to enter resulting in loss of merchantable volume {{at the time}} of final harvest. Cable yarding systems are needed for much of the thinning because most hemlock-spruce stands in the Pacific Northwest are located on steep slopes and fragile soils. It is during these thinning operations that much of the damage occurs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the significant harvesting variables affecting residual stand damage due to cable thinning a 30 -year-old hemlock -spruce stand. Detailed stand damage measurements were made during logging on nine skyline units in two study areas in western Oregon. Less detailed damage was measured on 18 other units to determine differences in damage levels between three different thinning treatments: conventional low intensity thinning, conventional high intensity thinning, and a herringlone (strip) thinning. Twenty-two variables were measured in two categories: harvesting variables and stand damage variables. Total scar area per turn (ft 2 /turn) was used as the dependent variable. As a result of regression analysis, the following variables were found to most significantly influence residual stand damage: number of <b>carriage</b> repositions, <b>log.</b> angle, <b>carriage</b> clearance., narrow treatment, rigging slinger, and cutter. An analysis of variance showed mean scar area per acre for the narrow and wide treatments were significantly different from the strip treatment. Only 12 percent of the residual stand (trees/acre) in the strip treatment were damaged. The narrow and wide treatments experienced much higher levels of 47 and 61 percent, respectively. Conventional thinning treatments experienced extensive damage levels (84. 78 ft 2 /acre in the narrow treatment and 91. 64 ft 2 /acre in the wide treatment) compared to the strip treatment (17. 57 ft 2 /acre). Individual scars ranged in size from 0. 02 to 14. 00 square feet. Of the total scar area in the detailed units, 66. 6 oercent was found within 20 feet of the skyline corridor centerline...|$|R
