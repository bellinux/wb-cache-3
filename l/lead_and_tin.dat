5|$|Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738, Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman, the {{distinctness}} of {{lead and}} bismuth became clear, and Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal {{is distinct from}} <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Book XXXIV {{covers the}} base metals, their uses and their extraction. Copper mining is mentioned, {{using a variety}} of ores {{including}} copper pyrites and marcasite, some of the mining being underground, some on the surface. Iron mining is covered, followed by <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin,</b> forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin,</b> which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E
5|$|Indium wire {{is used as}} {{a vacuum}} seal and a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps. Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin,</b> which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b> In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E

50|$|Valentin Rose the Elder (16 August 1736 - 28 April 1771) was a German {{pharmacist}} and chemist born in Neuruppin. He {{is remembered}} for {{creation of a}} fusible alloy known as Rose metal, which is composed of <b>lead,</b> bismuth <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density variously predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected to}} move so fast that it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E

25|$|For {{electrical}} and electronics work, solder wire {{is available in}} a range of thicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing flux. It is also available as a paste or as a preformed foil shaped to match the workpiece, more suitable for mechanized mass-production. Alloys of <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> were commonly used in the past and are still available; they are particularly convenient for hand-soldering. Lead-free solders have been increasing in use due to regulatory requirements plus the health and environmental benefits of avoiding lead-based electronic components. They are almost exclusively used today in consumer electronics.|$|E
50|$|Once the punches {{are ready}} a mold {{could then be}} created from the punch by using the punch on a softer metal (such as copper) to create a matrix.

25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin,</b> bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|E
25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state strain rate and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), grain boundary sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E
25|$|The Indus Valley {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} urban civilizations, {{along with}} its contemporaries, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving) and produced copper, bronze, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b> The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses. The baths and toilets system the cities had is acknowledged {{as one of the most}} advanced in the ancient world. The grid layout planning of the cities with roads at exact right angles is a modern system that was implemented in the cities of this particular civilization. The urban agglomeration and production scale of this particular civilization was unsurpassed at the time and for many future centuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} bismuth and indium {{have relatively}} low melting points {{when compared to}} other metals, and their alloy Bismuth Indium is classified as a fusible alloy. It has a melting point lower than the eutectic point of the tin lead alloy. The most common application of the alloy is as a low temperature solder, which can also contain, besides Bismuth <b>and</b> Indium, <b>lead,</b> cadmium <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b>|$|R

25|$|Due to {{differences}} in the social structure of society, the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century. On the continent, mineral deposits belonged to the crown, and this regalian right was stoutly maintained. But in England, royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver (of which England had virtually no deposits) by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law in 1688. England had iron, zinc, copper, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> ores. Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators. English, German, and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining. Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at Keswick in the northwestern mountains.|$|E
25|$|The Bronze Age in the Indus Valley began around 3300BCE {{with the}} Indus Valley Civilization. Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, {{it was one}} of three early civilizations of the Old World, and of the three the most widespread, {{covering}} an area of 1.25 million km2. It flourished in the basins of the Indus River, in what is today the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed {{in the vicinity of the}} seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra river in parts of northwest India. At its peak, the civilization hosted a population of approximately 5 million spread across hundreds of settlements extending as far as the Arabian Sea to present-day southern and eastern Afghanistan, and the Himalayas. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b>|$|E
25|$|At first, mints {{were set}} up in Luoyang in Henan, and also in Peking, Chengdu, Bingzhou (Taiyuan in Shanxi), and then Guilin in Guangxi. Minting rights were also granted to some princes and officials. By 660, {{deterioration}} of the coinage due to forgery had become a problem. The regulations were reaffirmed in 718, and forgeries suppressed. In 737, the first commissioner with overall responsibility for casting was appointed. In 739, ten mints were recorded, {{with a total of}} 89 furnaces casting some 327,000 strings of cash a year. 123 liang of metal were needed to produce a string of coins weighing 100 liang. In the late 740s, skilled artisans were employed for casting, rather than conscripted peasants. Despite these measures, the coinage continued to deteriorate. In 808, a ban on hoarding coins was proclaimed. This was repeated in 817. Regardless of the rank of a person, they could not hold more than 5,000 strings of cash. Cash balances exceeding this amount had to be expended within two months to purchase goods. This was an attempt to compensate for the lack of cash in circulation. By 834, mint output had fallen to 100,000 strings a year, mainly due to the shortage of copper. Forgeries using <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>tin</b> alloys were produced.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This {{is all the}} more remarkable for a region where metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, <b>lead,</b> electrum, <b>and</b> <b>tin.</b> The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|R
