25|$|<b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> is {{a member}} of the Arenavirida family of viruses. The <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> {{commonly}} spreads to humans from other animals, specifically a rodent known as a natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). This is probably the most common mouse in equatorial Africa, ubiquitous in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas. It is also called the natal multimammate rat or African rat.|$|E

25|$|In a {{differential}} diagnosis, infections {{with yellow}} fever must {{be distinguished from}} other feverish illnesses like malaria. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola virus, <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus,</b> Marburg virus, and Junin virus, must be excluded as cause.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> is one {{of several}} viruses {{identified}} by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic. They therefore list it for urgent research and development to develop new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and medicines.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} usually {{initially}} spread to people via {{contact with the}} urine or feces of an infected multimammate rat. Spread can then occur via direct contact between people. Diagnosis based on symptoms is difficult. Confirmation is by laboratory testing to detect the viruses RNA, antibodies to the virus, or the virus itself in cell culture. Other conditions that may present similarly include Ebola fever, malaria, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. The <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> {{is a member of}} the Arenaviridae virus family.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the Natal multimammate rat {{was found}} to be the natural host of the <b>Lassa</b> fever <b>virus.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lassa</b> <b>viruses</b> are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented, ambisense RNA viruses. Their genome is {{contained}} in two RNA segments that code for two proteins each, one in each sense, {{for a total of}} four viral proteins.The large segment encodes a small zinc-binding protein (Z) that regulates transcription and replication,and the RNA polymerase (L). The small segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the surface glycoprotein precursor (GP, also known as the viral spike), which is proteolytically cleaved into the envelope glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 that bind to the alpha-dystroglycan receptor and mediate host cell entry.|$|R
50|$|Rubins {{accepted}} a Fellow/Principal Investigator {{position at the}} Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (MIT/Cambridge, Massachusetts) and headed a lab of researchers studying viral diseases that primarily affect Central and West Africa. Work in the Rubins Lab focused on poxviruses and host-pathogen interaction as well as viral mechanisms for regulating host cell mRNA transcription, translation and decay. In addition, she conducted research on transcriptome and genome sequencing of filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and Arenaviruses (Lassa Fever) and collaborative projects with the U.S. Army to develop therapies for Ebola and <b>Lassa</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lassa fever, {{also known}} as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), {{is a type of}} viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus.</b> Many of those {{infected}} by the virus do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Among those who survive about a quarter have deafness which improves over time in about half.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety-level-4 {{laboratories}} {{are used}} for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever such as Marburg virus, Ebola virus, <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus,</b> Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and some Flaviviruses. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level. This level is also used for work with Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, though this work can only be done at the World Health Organization approved facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, U.S.A., as well as the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.|$|E

40|$|Arenaviruses {{are known}} to show {{antigenic}} relationships in the complement-fixation (CF) and fluorescent antibody tests {{but not in the}} neutralization test. The humoral response to some of the arenaviruses is characterized by a dissociation between the antibodies determined by the CF test and those determined by the neutralization test and also by its late appearance following natural infection. Investigations are reported showing that, as regards the CF test, Junin, Machupo, Amapari, and Tacaribe viruses are closely related, while LCM and <b>Lassa</b> <b>viruses</b> are distantly related {{to each other and to}} the remaining viruses in the group. Studies by agar gel diffusion and precipitation have shown complete specificity except among viruses that are very closely related in the CF test.

GS-5734 was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results have been promising, and further clinical trials are planned.|$|R

50|$|<b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> (LASV) is an arenavirus {{that causes}} Lassa hemorrhagic fever,a type of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), in humans and other primates. <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> is an {{emerging}} virus and a select agent, requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment. It is endemic in West African countries, especially Sierra Leone, the Republic of Guinea, Nigeria, and Liberia, where the annual incidence of infection is between 300,000 and 500,000 cases, resulting in 5,000 deaths per year.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> remains unclear, but it {{has been}} shown that the main targets of the virus are antigen-presenting cells (mainly dendritic cells) and endothelial cells. Also, it is reported that <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> prevents a host's innate immune system by NP activity. Generally, when a pathogen enters into a host, innate defense system recognizes the PAMPs (Pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and activates immune responses. One of the mechanisms detects double stranded RNA which is only synthesized by negative-sense viruses. In the cytoplasm, dsRNA receptors, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene 5), detects double stranded RNAs and initiates signaling pathways that results in translocation of IRF-3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) and other transcription factors to the nucleus. Translocated transcription factors activate expression of interferons 𝛂 and 𝛃, and secreted interferons initiate antiviral responses including adaptive immunity. NP encoded in <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> is essential in viral replication and transcription, but it also suppresses host innate IFN response by inhibiting translocation of IRF-3. NP of <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> is reported to have an exonuclease activity to only dsRNAs. dsRNA exonuclease activity of the NP leads to counteract IFN responses by digesting the PAMP which leads to the evasion of host immune responses.|$|E
50|$|Upon entry, the <b>Lassa</b> <b>virus</b> infects {{almost every}} {{tissue in the}} human body. It starts with the mucosa, intestine, lungs and urinary system, and then {{progresses}} to the vascular system.|$|E

Interestingly entry of <b>Lassa</b> fever <b>virus,</b> influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus were not affected by TIM-1 expression. TIM-1 and TIM-4 enhanced viral entry more than TIM-3.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimian Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (SHFV) {{has caused}} {{sporadic}} outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers in macaques at primate research facilities.

Disease severity was independent of dose with an overall mortality rate of 64 % with signs of hemorrhagic fever and multiple organ system involvement. Analyses comparing survivors and non-survivors were performed to identify factors associated with survival revealing differences in the kinetics of viremia, immunosuppression, and regulation of hemostasis. Notable similarities between the pathogenesis of SHFV in NHPs and hemorrhagic fever viruses in humans suggest that SHFV may serve as a suitable model of BSL- 4 pathogens...|$|R

When high dilutions of PV-immune serum were added to cultures simultaneously with PV inoculum, virus replication was dramatically (1000 -fold) increased. Low dilutions of this antiserum neutralized the virus. LFV also replicated in U 937 cells. The presence of LFV-specific immune serum in the growth medium increased the viral titre as much as 10000 -fold.
