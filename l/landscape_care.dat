There are scree slopes which are composed of homogeneous fragmentary rocks of the same shape and size. Their current form originated in the Quaternary, when their development was influenced by alternating glacial ages and interglacials, and is still in progress. The boulder screes can be found scattered throughout the Czech Republic and at some locations they might be created by different rocks.

40|$|Social farming {{adopts a}} {{multifunctional}} view of agriculture: the main products, {{in addition to}} saleable produce, are health and employment, education or therapy. Social farming includes agricultural enterprises and market gardens integrating people with physical, mental or emotional disabilities; farms which offer openings for the socially disadvantaged, for young offenders or those with learning difficulties, people with drug dependencies, the long-term unemployed and active senior citizens; school and kindergarten farms and many more. Prevention of illness, inclusion and {{a better quality of}} life are features and aims of social agriculture. Landscape seminars were carried out on social farms in order to elaborate aspects for landscape development and nature protection on farm level in a participatory way. Because of additional manpower such farms offer special opportunities for <b>landscape</b> <b>care</b> through many helping hands, but support and advice are needed. Landscape seminars appear to be a method to strengthen intrinsic motivation of people involved to improve their landscape and biotopes...|$|E

If {{the social}} {{relations}} and inherited configuration of production {{were at the}} core of economic geography a decade ago, these aspects of the world are increasingly taken for granted. The global scope of industry and corporate strategy has claimed increasing attention over the past decade. And while any “new ” economic geography must {{have something to say about}} the nature of human agency and the role of institutions in structuring the <b>landscape,</b> <b>care</b> must be taken not to exaggerate their significance for constructive interaction. In point of fact, the global finance industry is an essential lens through which to study contemporary capitalism from the topdown and the bottom-up. If we are to understand the economic landscape of 21 st century capitalism, it should be understood through global financial institutions, its social formations and investment practices. This argument is developed by reference to the recent literature on the geography of finance and a metaphor—money flows like mercury—designed to explicate the spatial and temporal logic of global capital flows. Some may dispute this argument. But in doing so they lament the passing of an era rather than advancing a convincing counter-claim about how the world is and what it might become.

This with special focus on the aspects of economics, authentic looking landscape, authentic way of working in the reserve, impact on the organisation of employees in the reserve and the pedagogic values which the horse creates to the visitor. All the five aspects are studied with the limitation of only looking at situations where the horses are being used in <b>landscape</b> <b>care</b> such as restorative forestry and agricultural work. The information is gather throughout interviews with staff from three different cultural reserves in the south of Sweden The informers is both individuals employed with administrating the reserve and the employees working the horses in the reserve. The situation in the reserves has been individually investigated, the three reserves being Vallby Sörgården, Komministerbostället Råshult and Äskhults by. An important part of the thesis is also built on literature concerning the work horse in the modern society. Literature which puts the topic in a context, e. g. the history of working horses in Sweden, is also included. The result of this thesis suggests that the work horse used for a tool in the strivings for achieving a good care in the Swedish cultural reserves under the right conditions can be considered a good choice.

40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis {{is to create}} a business plan for the implementation of a Green Gardener Certification Program in San Luis Obispo County. There is a need locally to conserve resources and to reduce pollution. Landscape maintenance professionals need the opportunity to receive further training in their field for licensing purposes as well as to get an edge in a competitive industry. The public of San Luis Obispo County deserves the opportunity to select a landscape maintenance professional that has been certified “green”. In 2000, Santa Barbara City and County Water Agencies implemented a Green Gardener certification program which was initially intended to address urban landscape irrigation efficiency. These agencies realized that landscape maintenance professionals had a huge impact on water efficiency and on non-point source pollution (Jordan 2 ̆ 6 Aston 2001). The California Department of Pesticide Regulation defines a maintenance gardener as a person who provides services such as: lawn mowing, care taking, and general yard cleanup in outdoor ornamental and garden areas (2010). Maintenance gardeners knowledge of <b>landscape</b> <b>care</b> comes from garden center sales staff, previous experience, or information their clients provide them; very few have ever received any formal landscape training (Kleeman 2009; Kreidich et al. 2005; Paine et al. 1997). The Green Gardener Program is an education and certification program that is intended to teach gardeners how to efficiently utilize valuable resources such as water, how to prevent pollution such as excessive use of synthetic fertilizers, and how to protect their client’s health by reducing their use of pesticides. Implementing a Green Gardener Program in San Luis Obispo County could prove to be an integral component in the pursuit to reduce air, soil, and water contamination...|$|E
40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{investigated}} proximity effects of greening, we know of no previous study that has employed a cadastral measure to examine proximity effects for urban residential landscapes. Cadastral refers to property boundaries, which is {{a different way to}} measure proximity compared with Euclidean measures, which are typically used. We assumed that each residential property would be managed homogeneously for cues to care (Nassauer, 2011) in visible front and side yards, and that consequently, measurement units delineated by residential properties boundaries would be more valid than units defined by Euclidean distance for measuring heterogeneity in <b>landscape</b> <b>care.</b> We investigated whether cadastral locations for surrounding residential properties significantly affect care for occupied residential parcels in two neighborhoods of Detroit, MI, USA, that are characterized by high levels of vacancy and abandonment of residential property. We used data describing cues to care for 8967 residential parcels information in the Brightmoor and Eastside neighborhoods. These data were collected by inspection of Google Street images checked by field inspection in summer 2011. We tested the relationship between each occupied parcel’s front yard cues to care and its surrounding parcels’ occupancy and care characteristics at eight cadastral locations. We describe these cadastral locations in Fig. 1. We hypothesized that for all surrounding parcels’ characteristics, cadastral locations that were adjacent, face-face and rook-face locations relative to the case parcels would influence the care of case parcels, and that adjacent parcels would have the greatest influence on care of case parcels. We hypothesized that back-back parcels and rook-back parcels, in contrast, would have no significant relationship with care of the case parcels, despite having similar Euclidean distances from the case parcels. Considering different care characteristics of surrounding parcels, we hypothesized that positive care of surrounding parcels would more powerfully affect cues to care of case parcels than would abandoned houses or vacant land on surrounding parcels (Table 2). We further hypothesized that, compared with vacant land, abandoned houses on surrounding parcels would have a stronger negative effect on care of case parcels. Results show that cadastral measures are an important way to analyze and interpret the influence of people’s behavior to cities’ appearance, and the results may guide city planners and policy makers to find a more effective way to revitalize high-vacancy city areas...|$|E

40|$|Construction of infrastructural {{networks}} and <b>landscape</b> <b>care</b> often play opposite {{roles in the}} design of balanced urban spaces: sometimes, however, technology and environment co-exist and get harmonized {{in the creation of the}} so-called Gartenkunst as “natura artificialis”. Case Study: in summer 1972, in the occasion of the XX Olympic Games, Munich opened the Olympiapark-München, (called “Oypark”), synthesis of a multi-year plan of infrastructures for roads, services, residences, sports and leisure time. The vast area – on a surface of 300 hectares – attracts flows of visitors, sports amateurs or common pedestrians who stroll and bike along lawns and paths, or visit the areas on electric trains sightseeing the sweet hilly landscape. Olympiapark is more than just that : it represents the physical translation of the ideal conception of civil society in Germany after the second World War, a kind of “historical picture” of juvenile movements of the Sixties, mainly made up by pacifists and liberals [...] That vis civile is reflected in the sophisticated simplicity of the Landschaftarchitektur as well as in the architectural works gathered – bright and inviting – around the artificial lake. Less known to the public is the fact that such an idyllic landscape was modelled on the ground of a huge dumpsite of war debris. Such deep symbolic value – to build a “place of peace and harmony” – is the interpretation key of a successful experiment of progressive planning. Since its very first conception (Günther Grzimek, 1968 - 72) both the plan and the park have been proof of a choice that can be surely defined as “environmentally sustainable” ante-litteram. Concept and Planning Principles. The project and its implementation are the result of five-year elaborations made by a high-level multi-disciplinary team coordinated by G. Behnisch & Partner and with the contribution of Frei Otto and Fritz Leonhardt. Planning design, formal quality and technological innovation merge into an articulated design of road-and-rail integrated mobility. Olympiapark is today among the urban places with the highest urban dynamism : the works of the “historical” district have been completed with other installations of high architectural level and value which have increased service quality and attractiveness both at urban and territorial level. In par-ticular, the Landmark of BMW-Museum | BMW-Welt and München Olympia-Einkaufszentrum – built at the intersection of the U 3 |U 1 subway lines- attract huge flows of visitors and tourists. The subway station itself – recently re-styled – is a sort of super-place stolen to the metropolitan ano-nymity by means of colours and pictures. In fact, it is here, and in the three other subway stations, where most of the district life takes place, a district which is “nomadic” and at high-density of youngsters and students. Conclusions: Olypark – with its urban “archipelago”- can be considered as a key example of that willingness to harmonize environmental recovery, social mainstreaming and mobility : today the implementation of policies of Social Housing and the availability of integrated services are able to offer suggestions, inputs, models for the recovery of the European global city. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{qualitative}} research project, I examine {{the development of}} <b>landscapes</b> of <b>care</b> for, and by, identified trafficked people {{and its implications for}} rebuilding a sense of place and identity. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic data, I argue that discourse, place and identity interact to form complex landscapes within both providers and clients/patients that emerge as distinct experiences of care or non-care experiences. Each analytical chapter examines a particular production of care: a merging of psycho-legal care, the interactions of formalized informal caring relationships, and the burden of external identification in the configuration of self-identity among identified trafficked people. Building on anthropological theories of care (Giordano 2014; Mulla 2014; Stevenson 2014; Mattingly 2010), these chapters build the argument that, in contrast to humanitarian human trafficking and trauma discourse that focuses on a specific kind of trafficking experience; the complex assemblage of trafficking experience and subsequent care should be considered within what I term “structural trafficking. ” Becoming identified as trafficked is beneficial for receiving specific rights and services. However, this identity can also be detrimental for rebuilding a sense of self and place, because it assumes a fixed experience that translates to fixed care packages. I examine multiple <b>landscapes</b> of <b>care</b> to better understand potentials for care by expanding identity and coordinating existing and novel systems of care...|$|R

Using Coles's rethinking {{of the politics of}} generosity, we interrogate ethos in terms of three ideal types [...] Christian caritas, secular humanism, and postsecular charity [...] concluding that the principal fault-line in current services divides organisations which expect particular behavioural outcomes from homeless people (including Christian 'conversion' and more secular assumptions of self-responsibility), and those which provide care regardless of individual response. ...|$|R
