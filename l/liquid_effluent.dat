50|$|The process {{produces}} primary treated blackwater, {{with much}} of the solid organic material removed from the effluent. Because <b>liquid</b> <b>effluent</b> is discharged almost immediately on entering the digester, little dissolved oxygen is consumed by the wastewater through the filtration stage.

Metal precipitation by Microbial Metabolism Microbial metabolism alters the microenvironment of the cells in different ways according to the type of the terminal electron acceptor used. This modification of the cell microenvironment creates favorable conditions for metal ions precipitation in the liquid in contact with the microbial biomass. Classification of microbial metabolism can be based on the type of the terminal electron acceptors used by the cells.
