50|$|The {{boats were}} built to be {{operated}} by one person standing inside {{on the port side}} beside the engine, the steering wheel was mounted on a frame along the side so the person can operate the throttle for the engine, the <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> shifting the gearbox, and the <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> operating the winch all on their right side, and steer the boat by turning the wheel with their left hand.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the throttle control <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The throttle control <b>lever</b> <b>for</b> the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|R
