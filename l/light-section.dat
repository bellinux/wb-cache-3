50|$|As {{the output}} signal after the {{pre-processing}} of sensor signals with a laser scanner and <b>light-section</b> sensor, the so-called height {{profile of the}} measured groove geometry is achieved. It represents {{the surface of the}} workpiece along the section at the projected laser line.3 D measuring systems with active illumination are mainly using the <b>light-section</b> method in combination with the projection of several parallel laser lines. In doing so, each line generates a height profile. Through the arrangement of several lines along the weld groove, a further dimension is achieved which shows the change of the height profiles of the groove geometry. Through the number of the lines, the resolution in groove longitudinal direction is increasing, however, the data processing expenditure is also increasing. Similar to the projection of several parallel lines, the measurement via a projected circle or other geometrical figures on the workpiece surface is possible.|$|E
50|$|As an alternative, an {{oscillating}} {{movement of the}} entire sensor head can be carried out, this is, however, only considered a special application of a one-dimensionally measuring system. An advantage of the laser scanner is that, with according processing speed, the lighting conditions can be adapted for every single point-shaped distance measurement which results in illumination uniformity. Moreover, due to the point-shaped illumination, the laser point is through the concentrated laser power and also through appropriate optical filters, compared with the interfering arc radiation, easier to detect by the detection element.The <b>light-section</b> sensor avoids the disadvantage of moving parts in the sensor head (Figure 6). Here, the surface is not scanned pointwise, the entire geometry is, moreover, captured in one image. For this purpose, the point-shaped laser beam is expanded via an optics to a line which is projected {{onto the surface of}} the workpiece transverse to the groove in accordance with the scan line of the scanner. The laser line is, in accordance with the same geometrical principle of triangulation, again acquired with a detector element, this time, however, two-dimensionally. For the acquisition, CCD and CMOS cameras with the above-mentioned properties can be used.|$|E

40|$|A CCD camera based optical {{metrology}} {{system has been}} developed for the accurate measurement of a railway locomotive's wheel movements {{with respect to the}} rails. The system is based on the <b>light-sectioning</b> method, implemented with four laser diodes projecting light sheets onto the wheel and rail. A high-resolution CCD camera views the four profiles simultaneously, using an appropriately folded and combined beam-path. To minimize the effects of ambient light, a special narrow-band dielectric filter was designed, manufactured and fitted {{in front of the camera}} lens. The desired measurement accuracy requires pixel-synchronous acquisition of the CCD video data. This is realized with a custom-built universal CCD data acquistion system, with which profile tracking, data compression and storage at 12. 5 Hz (half frame-rate) is made possible. A prototype system was built and tested on railway tracks at up to 140 km/h.

40|$|Flying Triangulation sensors {{enable a}} free-hand and motion-robust 3 D data {{acquisition}} of complex shaped objects. The measurement principle {{is based on}} a multi-line <b>light-sectioning</b> approach and uses sophisticated algorithms for real-time registration (S. Ettl et al., Appl. Opt. 51 (2012) 281 - 289). As "single-shot principle", light sectioning enables the option to get surface data from one single camera exposure. But there is a drawback: A pixel-dense measurement is not possible because of fundamental information-theoretical reasons. By "pixel-dense" we understand that each pixel displays individually measured distance information, neither interpolated from its neighbour pixels nor using lateral context information. Hence, for monomodal single-shot principles, the 3 D data generated from one 2 D raw image display a significantly lower space-bandwidth than the camera permits. This is the price one must pay for motion robustness. Currently, our sensors project about 10 lines (each with 1000 pixels), reaching an considerable lower data efficiency than theoretically possible for a single-shot sensor. Our aim is to push Flying Triangulation to its information-theoretical limits. Therefore, the line density as well as the measurement depth needs to be significantly increased. This causes serious indexing ambiguities. On the road to a single-shot 3 D movie camera, we are working on solutions to overcome the problem of false line indexing by utilizing yet unexploited information. We will present several approaches and will discuss profound information-theoretical questions about the information efficiency of 3 D sensors.

40|$|Parameters {{that affect}} chunky {{graphite}} formation in heavy-section castings {{have been studied}} in previous works which showed that inoculation and cerium addition both increase the tendency for this degenerate graphite. This suggested that laboratory study on chunky graphite formation could be performed on small castings by over-treating the melt. Though the role of silicon was not ascertained, it appeared of potential interest to also investigate its effect in relation with the carbon equivalent of the iron and the nucleation potential of the melt. Keel-blocks were thus cast using Ce or Ce-Mg treated melts, with increased silicon content (up to 4. 0 wt. %) and inoculation rate as compared to usual practice. It was observed that chunky graphite systematically appeared in more or less extended areas centred on {{the upper part of}} the keel-blocks. The as-cast microstructure (graphite shape and distribution) has then been studied in relation to melt composition and additions (Ce treatment and inoculation) in both affected and non-affected areas. Finally, microanalysis of oxides and other minor phases showed them to be similar to those appearing in heavy-section castings. It may then be concluded that chunky graphite appears in <b>light-section</b> castings in the same way than in heavy-section castings when using over-treated melts...|$|E
40|$|Precise 3 D {{measurements}} of rigid surfaces are desired in many fields of application like quality control or surgery. Often, views {{from all around}} the object have to be acquired for a full 3 D description of the object surface. We present a sensor principle called "Flying Triangulation" which avoids an elaborate "stop-and-go" procedure. It combines a low-cost classical <b>light-section</b> sensor with an algorithmic pipeline. A hand-guided sensor captures a continuous movie of 3 D views while being moved around the object. The views are automatically aligned and the acquired 3 D model is displayed in real time. In contrast to most existing sensors no bandwidth is wasted for spatial or temporal encoding of the projected lines. Nor is an expensive color camera necessary for 3 D acquisition. The achievable measurement uncertainty and lateral resolution of the generated 3 D data is merely limited by physics. An alternating projection of vertical and horizontal lines guarantees the existence of corresponding points in successive 3 D views. This enables a precise registration without surface interpolation. For registration, a variant of the iterative closest point algorithm - adapted to the specific nature of our 3 D views - is introduced. Furthermore, data reduction and smoothing without losing lateral resolution as well as the acquisition and mapping of a color texture is presented. The precision and applicability of the sensor is demonstrated by simulation and measurement results. Comment: 19 pages, 22 figure...|$|E

We confirmed the influence from the difference in height (depth) caused by forgoing reasons included in a data can be reduced significantly at this stage. Various parameters of ball radius were applied for checking how the result of data obtained with this process vary according to the change of parameter and it becomes clear that there are not important differences by the change of parameters if they are in a certain range radius. And then, image segmentation was performed by multi-resolution segmentation based on the object-based image analysis technique. The parameters for the image segmentation, scale, pixel value (height/depth) and the compactness of objects were used. For the classification of cracks in the database, the height, length and other geometric property are used and we confirmed the method is useful for the detection of cracks in a paved road surface...|$|E
