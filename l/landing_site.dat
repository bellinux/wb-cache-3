5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} recent impact created Cone crater, 1,000 feet across and 250 feet deep, near the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of Apollo 14. One {{of the main}} objectives of that mission was to sample the original Imbrium material located on its rim.|$|E

5|$|After {{selecting}} the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's shrine was re-established in March 2012 at {{the church}} of St. Augustine in Ramsgate, Kent, {{very close to the}} mission's <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> St Augustine's Cross, a Celtic cross erected in 1884, marks the spot in Ebbsfleet, Thanet, East Kent, where Augustine is said to have landed.|$|E
5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, {{the valley}} floor is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders of various sizes and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the ALSEP lunar experiment deployment area, located west of the immediate <b>landing</b> <b>site,</b> the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than {{in other areas of}} the valley.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of all {{existing}} radar {{data for}} the two Mars Exploration Rover (MER) <b>landing</b> <b>sites</b> at Meridiani Planum and Gusev Crater suggest that their meter-scale morphological appearance will be noticeably different than previous Mars landing sites; their human-scale, decimeter-to meter-scale roughness {{is not the same}} as for previous Mars <b>landing</b> <b>sites.</b> We make this prediction based on a comparison of the MER <b>landing</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} on the Wirral has identified a possible <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> for the Norse and Scots. This is a feature called Wallasey Pool. This is {{in the north of}} the Wirral near the River Mersey. The pool is linked to the river by a creek which, before it was developed into modern docks, stretched inland some two miles, was, at high tide over 20 feet deep and was surrounded by a moss or mere which is now known as Bidston Moss. In addition to this <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> a Roman Road leads from the area of Bidston to Chester. Following the route of this road would take an invading force through the area the battle {{is believed to have been}} fought. Landscape survey has identified a likely position for Bruna's burh.

With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation.
