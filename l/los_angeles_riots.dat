We find some support for the notions that the opportunity costs of time and the potential costs of punishment influence the incidence and intensity of riots. Beyond these individual costs and benefits, community structure matters. In our results, ethnic diversity seems a significant determinant of rioting, while we find little evidence that poverty in the community matters. ...|$|R
50|$|Smoky Night is a 1994 children's book by Eve Bunting. It {{tells the}} story of a <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riot</b> and its {{aftermath}} through the eyes of a young boy named Daniel.

40|$|Abstract – The <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riot</b> in {{the spring}} of 1992 remains an ever-haunting example of the {{destructive}} manner in which some individuals handle social rage. While understanding some of the myriad of reasons for social rage could help address the psychological nature of such a problem, this work focuses on developing a model of the physical interactions that may precipitate a riot. In particular, an agent-based model is used to create both a car physics model and a social force model that are used to simulate a riot at an intersection. An example is given where emergent behaviors that closely match those in a riot situation, i. e., where cars are stopped and drivers are attacked, are obtained by choosing appropriate parameters for the models...|$|R
