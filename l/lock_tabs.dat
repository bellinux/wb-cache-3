40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a lock pin. The lock block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>tab</b> on the <b>lock</b> block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A lock pin is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the <b>lock</b> <b>tab</b> bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the lock pin is installed, an apertured-end portion of the lock pin is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the lock pin from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R
50|$|In 1970 Mayfield's Athens {{plant was}} the first in the {{industry}} to successfully implement in-plant blow-molding for production of plastic milk jugs. In 1988 Mayfield {{was the first}} dairy to use an opaque plastic milk jug that protects milk from ultraviolet light. In 1995, Mayfield launched the single-serve Chug milk bottle for Dean Foods. The single-serve bottle increased milk consumption by letting milk compete with single-serving soft drinks. In 2002 its Clik-Top re-sealable ice cream carton, including a break-seal that makes the package easier to open and a <b>locking</b> <b>tab</b> to keep the carton closed during storage, was greeted as a packaging first.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 1989, an Interflug Ilyushin Il-62 (registered DDR-SEW) {{overshot}} {{the runway}} during a take-off attempt at Schönefeld Airport and caught fire, killing 21 of the 103 passengers {{that had been}} on the flight to Moscow (all ten crew members survived). There was one additional ground casualty. The accident was caused by a jammed rudder after a <b>locking</b> <b>tab</b> had been left in place during maintenance. When instructed to apply reverse thrust, the flight engineer mistakenly switched the engines off. Due to the anniversary of the 1953 East German uprising and the at that time tensed atmosphere within the GDR, initially an act of sabotage was suspected, which led to a delayed medical assistance for the injured.|$|R

5000|$|For {{some time}} Union Connector {{produced}} 2P&G connectors with a distinctive yellow cover that featured a <b>locking</b> <b>tab</b> {{in the ground}} pin that provided a positive mechanical lock to prevent accidental disengagement of the connectors. This design required special connectors on both {{the male and female}} side in order to work, meaning that all connectors in an installation would need to be replaced to see a real benefit to the locking feature. The expense of this proposition as well as the unpopularity of the connector itself among technicians led the locking feature to eventually be dropped, and locking connectors are no longer manufactured. The locking connectors that are still found occasionally in installations or spare parts bins are often referred to as [...] "Union Connectors", though the Union Connector brand now features only standard non-locking stage pin connectors.|$|R
40|$|An {{assembly}} of three major components is disclosed {{which included a}} wrist interface plate which is secured to the wrist joint of a robotic arm, a tool interface plate which is secured to each tool intended {{for use by the}} robotic arm, and a tool holster for each tool attached to the interface plate. The wrist interface plate and a selected tool interface plate are mutually connectable together through an opening or recess in the upper face of the interface plate by means of a notched tongue protruding from the front face of the wrist interface plate which engages a pair of spring-biased rotatable notched wheels located within the body of the tool interface plate. The tool holster captures and locks onto the tool interface plate by means of a pair of actuation claws including a <b>locking</b> <b>tab</b> and an unlocking wedge which operate respective actuation bosses on each of the notched wheels in response to a forward and backward motion of the tool interface plate as a result of motion of the robotic arm to either park the tool or use the tool...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{quick-release pin}} mechanism supplants a prior such mechanism {{in which the}} pin bears a shear load to hold two objects together. The prior mechanism, of a ball-locking design, can fail when vibrations cause balls to fall out. The load-bearing pin is an outer tube with a handle at one end (hereafter denoted the near end). Within the outer tube is a spring-loaded inner tube that includes a handle at its near end and a pivoting tab at its far end. The pin is inserted through holes in the objects to be retained and the inner tube is pushed against an offset pivot inside the outer tube to make the tab rotate outward so that it protrudes past the outer diameter of the outer tube, and the spring load maintains this configuration so that the pin cannot be withdrawn through the holes. Pushing the handles together against the spring load moves the <b>locking</b> <b>tab</b> out far enough that the tab becomes free to rotate inward. Then releasing the inner-tube handle causes the tab to be pulled into a resting position inside the outer tube. The pin can then be pulled out through the holes...|$|R
50|$|The {{container}} has {{the advantage}} of being inexpensive, durable and fairly leak-proof {{as long as it is}} kept upright. The top usually includes a <b>locking</b> paperboard <b>tab</b> so that it is self-closing. The simple origami-like folded construction also allows for some escape of steam from hot food. If care is used to remove the flaps, and the sides are unfolded, the container can also double as a somewhat flimsy plate. However it is also typical to eat directly out of the container, a feat that the long reach of chopsticks makes easier. The containers are primarily used with American Chinese cuisine, though they have started to spread in some European countries.|$|R

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Materiel Command, Army Air Forces, flight tests were {{conducted}} on a P- 5 lD- 20 -NA (AAF No. 44 - 63826) airplane equipped with a horn-balanced rudder. This rudder was fitted with an unbalancing tab as was the original product fan rudder. Tests were made both with the unbalancing tab in operation and with the unbalancing <b>tab</b> <b>locked.</b> The modification to the original vertical tail consisted of removing the cap {{from the top of the}} fin and adding 1. 91 square feet of area to the rudder as the horn balance and 0. 82 square foot of area to the top of the rudder aft of the hinge line. A comparison of the directional stability and control characteristics of the P- 51 D airplane with three different vertical-tail configurations - the horn balance, original production, and extended tail (with unbalancing <b>tab</b> <b>locked)</b> configurations are presented herein. The tests of the horn-balanced rudder were conducted at the Langley Laboratory in 1945. The tests of the original-tail configuration were previously conducted at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. Tests of the extended-tail configuration were conducted at the Langley Laboratory and are reported...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Glock {{announced}} the Internal Locking System (ILS) safety feature. The ILS is a manually activated lock {{located in the}} back of the pistol's grip. It is cylindrical in design and, according to Glock, each key is unique. When activated, the <b>lock</b> causes a <b>tab</b> to protrude from the rear of the grip, giving both a visual and tactile indication as to whether the lock is engaged or not. When activated, the ILS renders the Glock unfireable, as well as making it impossible to disassemble. When disengaged, the ILS adds no further safety mechanisms to the Glock pistol. The ILS is available as an option on most Glock pistols. Glock pistols cannot be retrofitted to accommodate the ILS. The lock must be factory built in Austria and shipped as a special order.|$|R
50|$|A Lens board (commonly spelled as lensboard) is a {{photographic}} part used for securing a lens {{to the front}} standard of a large format view camera. The lens board itself is usually flat, square, and made of metal (most commonly Aluminum) or wood and sometimes plastic. The lens board will have a hole of various diameters drilled dead center on the board. A lens board typically varies between 1 and 4 millimeters in thickness. The overall {{size and shape of}} the lens board depends on the brand of camera and film format used. Some cameras will use 2 to 4 screws to secure the lens board to the front standard of the view camera, most commonly however, the lens board will be secured by one or more <b>locking</b> levers or <b>tabs</b> to allow tool-less removal of the lens board. The rear surface of a lens board is usually painted matte black to keep light entering the camera through the lens during exposure from reflecting off the surface and interfering with the projected image.|$|R
