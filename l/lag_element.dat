Given the limitations of design in eliminating this dynamic phenomenon, there exists a need for control. We believe that this paper is the first model-based effort to attempt the same.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{powertrain}} model of a vehicle and parametrize itusing non-invasive sensors. The non-invasive sensors available were chassis dynamometer,the pedal robot and the vehicle’s on-board diagnostics which was accessed using a scantool. Non-invasive sensors were used so that the vehicle to model can easily be changed. Aparametrization methodology to parametrize the model for a new vehicle was also developedto facilitate the change of vehicle. The powertrain model is for cars with a combustion engineand a manual gearbox. The engine model consist of two static maps, a pedal map and an engine map. The pedalmap is created using the fact that a constant pedal position and engine speed gives a constantthrottle position. The engine map is created in similar manner using that a constant throttleposition and engine speed gives a constant engine torque. The engine model also uses a firstorder <b>lag</b> <b>element</b> to model the time delay from a change in pedal position to a change inwheel torque. The driveline model is a rigid driveline model that assumes that the clutch,driveshaft and propeller shaft are stiff. The developed parametrization methodology contains information on how to estimate theparameters of the model which are gear ratios, engine and driveline inertias, engine anddriveline losses, engine and pedal maps and the time constant for the time delay. The powertrain model was validated component wise, as standalone and integrated intothe vehicle model against data gathered {{with the help of the}} chassis dynamometer. For thestandalone and integrated validation the gathered data were for different driving cases, suchas up and down gear-shifting, engine braking and skipping gears. The standalone validationshowed that the model performed well for the presented driving cases and the results hadgood data fit for 3 rd gear and higher. However not for 1 st and 2 nd gear due to problemsin the pedal map. The pedal map was constructed on the assumption that the same pedalposition for all gears gives the same throttle position, which was not always the case. Thiscaused problems in some areas of the engine and pedal maps however in the validation ofthe maps it was shown that the maps for the most part gave good results...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – The partial least squares approach is used to examine the information technology (IT) industry in Taiwan. Findings – Results show that intellectual capital elements directly affect business performance, with the exception of human capital. Human capital indirectly affects performance through the other three elements: innovation capital, process capital, and customer capital. There also exists a cause-effect relationship among four elements of intellectual capital. Human capital affects innovation capital and process capital. Innovation capital affects process capital, which in turn influences customer capital. Finally, customer capital contributes to performance. The cause-effect relationship between leading <b>elements</b> and <b>lagged</b> <b>elements</b> provides implications for the management of firms in the IT industry. Research limitations/implications – The model proposed in this study is applicable to the high-tech IT industry.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a generalised {{version of the}} recently proposed ordinal partition time series to network transformation algorithm. Firstly we introduce a fixed time <b>lag</b> for the <b>elements</b> of each partition that is selected using techniques from traditional time delay embedding. The resulting partitions define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the network space. Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the Rössler system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures [...] thereby indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive to system dynamics. Furthermore we demonstrate that simple network measures including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov exponent. We also apply the same analysis to experimental time series generated by a diode resonator circuit and show that the network size, mean shortest path length and network diameter are highly sensitive to the interior crisis captured in this particular data set...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Modern uses of rotating shafts depend upon bearing speeds and temperatures that exceed normal operating parameters. In order to accommodate these excessive parameters, magnetic bearings have replaced ball or thrust bearings. However, eddy currents cause a loss of power and instability in magnetic bearings. The eddy current magnitude is responsible for the power loss, while the phase lag between the magnetic field and the input or control current causes the instability. This study incorporated finite element studies of magnetic thrust bearings using static bench testing procedures to investigate configurations that promote eddy current reduction. Several rotor/stator configurations, including solid metal, laminated washers, tapewound lam-inates. and solid wedge pieces are used to determine the smallest phase <b>lag</b> configuration. Finite <b>element</b> analysis will compare a solid configuration bench test with an axisymmetric finite element model and illustrate the fringing effect that occurs with magnetic bearings.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis is to study the behaviour of stiffened compression flanges of steel box girder bridges. Various collapse modes and many different parameters that effect the behaviour of the stiffened panels which make up the flanges have been considered. In order to achieve this, {{a series of three}} parametric studies have been carried out using a finite element package (LUSAS), which allows for both material and geometric non-linearities. The aim of the work was, in the main, to provide a datum for assessing design recommendations being prepared for the ECCS (European Convention for Constructional Steelwork), and to help in their development. The recommendations were developed as part of this research programme. The first parametric study looked at a range of isolated stiffened panels subjected to uniform uniaxial compression, representing the compression flange of a box girder subjected to pure moment. This validated the basic requirements within the recommendations for the strength of longitudinally stiffened flange panels. The second study was aimed at examining the effect of the shear flexibility of the flange of a girder loaded by vertical shear. In order to study the influence of this flexibility which results in a lag in stresses across the box width relative to the edges (shear <b>lag),</b> finite <b>element</b> results were generated for panels loaded along their longitudinal edges by in-plane uniform shear stress. A new model has been established from these results to predict the effect of shear lag. The model consists of two equations. The first is concerned with the prediction of the elastic shear lag effective breadth ratio while the second is concerned with the effect of shear lag at collapse. The latter is substantially different because of the ability for plastic redistribution of direct stress to occur across the flange prior to collapse. Finally, a third study looked at the forces on, and the behaviour of the cross-frames in orthogonally stiffened flanges. The results of the study showed that the flange applied a more complex lateral load distribution to these stiffeners than currently considered in design practice with, for some parameters, substantially higher load levels than required in the strength requirement of the British code for the design of bridges. A modification is proposed to the rules to provide transverse stiffeners which satisfy both stiffness and strength considerations...|$|R

The aim of the study is to highlight the need of a specific Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) to excite a process under control. As the neural network is a data driven technique, the method for data generation plays an important role. In light of this a careful experimentation procedure for data generation was crucial task. Heat exchange is a complex process, which has a capacity and a time <b>lag</b> as process <b>elements.</b> The proposed system is a typical pipe-in- pipe type heat exchanger. The complexity of the system demands careful selection, proper installation and commissioning. The temperature, flow, and pressure sensors {{play a vital role in}} the control performance. The final control element used is a pneumatically operated control valve. While carrying out the experimentation on heat exchanger a welldrafted procedure is followed giving utmost attention towards safety of the system. The results obtained are encouraging and revealing the fact that if the process details are known completely as far as process parameters are concerned and utilities are well stabilized then feedback systems are suitable, whereas neural network control paradigm is useful for the processes with nonlinearity and less knowledge about process. The implementation of NN control reinforces the concepts of process control and NN control paradigm. The result also underlined the importance of excitation signal typically for that process. Data acquisition, processing, and presentation in a typical format are the most important parameters while validating the results. Keywords—Process identification, neural network, heat exchanger.

Evaluation of three sizings, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a carboxyl modified polyhydroxyether (PHE), and a standard industrial sizing (G'), have revealed tremendous improvements in static mechanical and enviro-mechanical properties. The focus of this work is to determine if these improvements in performance can be ascertained from a micromechanical test for interfacial shear strength (IFSS) on as-processed materials. The accomplishment of this goal would create more information with fewer experiments and a need for less experimental materials. In this study, a nanoindenter uniquely outfitted with a blunt tip is effectively used to obtain microindentation results where the debond load is extracted directly from the experimental load-deflection curve. Shear <b>lag</b> and finite <b>element</b> analyses {{are used to}} evaluate the mechanics of the system, but both methods show limitations with regard to determining interfacial stresses in an experimental system. In the results obtained, the PHE and G' materials outperform the PVP in IFSS, but the bulk properties for PVP and PHE outperform the G' material, suggesting the presence of another dominant mechanism. Despite better retention of bulk properties after hygrothermal exposure, PHE experiences degradation in IFSS that PVP does not. The PHE loses 10 % of its original IFSS after 576 hours of 65 C moisture exposure, while PVP improves by 25 %. The tensile strengths for PHE and PVP decrease 7 % and 10 % respectively at 576 hours exposure.

50|$|Cloud gaming {{is a type}} {{of online}} gaming where the entire game is hosted on a game server in a data center, and the user is only running a thin client locally that {{forwards}} game controller actions upstream to the game server. The game server then renders the next frame of the game video which is compressed using low-lag video compression and is sent downstream and decompressed by the thin client. For the cloud gaming experience to be acceptable, the round-trip <b>lag</b> of all <b>elements</b> of the cloud gaming system (the thin client, the Internet and/or LAN connection the game server, the game execution on the game server, the video and audio compression and decompression, and the display of the video on a display device) must be low enough that the user perception is that the game is running locally. Because of such tight lag requirements, distance considerations of the speed of light through optical fiber come into play, currently limiting the distance between a user and a cloud gaming game server to approximately 1000 miles, according to OnLive, the only company thus far operating a cloud gaming service.There is also much controversy about the lag associated with cloud gaming. In multiplayer games using a client/server network architecture, the player's computer renders the game's graphics locally and only information about the player's in-game actions are sent to the server. For example, when the player presses a button, the character on-screen instantly performs the corresponding action. However, the consequences of the action such as an enemy being killed are only seen after a short delay due to the time taken for the action to reach the server. This is only acceptable as long as the response to the player's input is fast enough.|$|R
