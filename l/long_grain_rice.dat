50|$|Other {{varieties}} of rice eaten in Thailand include: sticky rice (khao niao), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual {{balance of the}} starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Sticky rice, not jasmine rice, is a staple food in the local cuisines of northern Thailand and of Isan (northeastern Thailand), both regions of Thailand directly adjacent to Laos with which they share many cultural traits. Thai Red Cargo rice, an unpolished <b>long</b> <b>grain</b> <b>rice</b> with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice {{is a type of}} sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>grain</b> {{breakage}} during milling is {{a problem}} in many parts of Asia. It has been suggested that nitrogen (N) fertilizer can improve the milling quality of rice. Therefore, this study investigates effects of N fertilization on grain N concentration, endosperm storage protein distribution, and milling quality of rice. Four Thai extra <b>long</b> <b>grain</b> commercial <b>rice</b> cultivars (KDML 105, KLG 1, PTT 1, and CNT 1) were grown at Chiang Mai University in the wet season of 2001 with 0 or 120 kg of N/ha at flowering. Anatomical sections showed that there was more storage protein accumulated in the lateral regions of polished grain of high N concentration than in grain of low N concentration. Percent (%) unbroken rice was positively correlated with relative abundance of storage protein in the lateral region of the endosperm in all cultivars. Applying N increased head rice N concentration in all cultivars, whereas % unbroken rice was increased in KLG 1 and CNT 1. KDML 105 cultivar, on the other hand, already had high % unbroken rice and more abundant storage protein in the lateral region with the grain of low N concentration. It is hypothesized that high density of storage protein in the lateral region of the endosperm provides resilience and lessens grain breakage during milling. The additional protein may increase hardness in <b>rice</b> <b>grains</b> and thus could make the rice more resistant to breakage during milling. Furthermore, N fertilization may enhance the nutritional quality of <b>rice</b> <b>grain</b> by increasing the glutelin content, which is rich in lysine...|$|R
