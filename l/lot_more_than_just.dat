25|$|The {{architecture}} is best understood and {{is almost always}} broken up into four groups and then looking at how architecture changed or didn’t change within those groups. The four groups are: May, Satunsat, and Ah Canul/Canul and Dzib. These groups make up the urban center, and are almost exclusively monumental architecture. They were defined by the excavation team and they’re essentially just a cluster of buildings, or a building (Madrid, 1991). There’s a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> these four groups; the rest just hasn’t been excavated really, since {{there was such a}} heavy focus on excavating monumental architecture. Most of what’s been excavated at Oxkintok is temples, palaces, and multiroom structures. To trace the changes in architecture of the site, the above chart (Fig. 7) was compiled. It’s a compilation of data from the three sources listed below figure 7. It is evident that there are lots of major changes between the three periods, and in general it's a transition from irregular design to a more elaborate, very planned out geometric design with decoration and complex stucco art and stone wrought decorations. One thing that remains consistent the use of domes and arches for entryways and open spaces. Concerning the individual groups, there's a concentration of Proto Puuc in the Ah-Canul group and Early Oxkintok in the May group that was later modified in the Proto Puuc phase, but no group is confined to one phase.|$|E

This, along with the track names, led to the widespread misunderstanding that the music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured. Lucas explained that the band started each performance with a [...] "very defined compositional basis" [...] before developing it further in a highly structured yet [...] "very free way"; the [...] "Right Off" [...] segment was improvised from the original recording's E-flat riff. Davis had the band play around a single chord in a piece for several minutes with variations as each member performed in a different time signature; Foster might have been playing in common time and Mtume in compound duple metre or septuple time, while the guitarists would comp in another tempo altogether. [...] "That's a lot of intricate shit we were working off this one chord", Davis remarked. From Lucas' perspective, this kind of [...] "structured improvisation" [...] resulted in significant interplay between the rhythm section and allowed the band to improvise [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the notes that were being played in the solos; we were improvising the entire song as we went along." ...|$|E

2500|$|Relatives of {{the missing}} 43 {{students}} toured the United States in April 2015 {{to raise awareness of}} the events that took place in Iguala. Known as the Caravana 43, the tour was organized in conjunction with a national coalition of social activist groups seeking justice for Ayotzinapa. The tour of 14 parents, students, and advocates was split into three groups that covered eastern, middle, and western regions of the United States, stopping in a total of 43 cities over 19 states before convening for a march to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Caravana 43 claimed no connection to any official political party or national organization. Instead, its organization was completely voluntary with transportation and accommodations for the relatives covered entirely by donations from individuals in host cities. Local groups [...] "committed themselves to support the fundamental goal of providing a platform for the parents in the United States and assumed the organizational and financial responsibility for the Caravan." [...] By creating the opportunity for the relatives to travel throughout the United States, organizers hoped to better inform the American public and new media about the attacks and disappearances. In each of the host cities, relatives spoke not only of their loss, but also of the systematic violence and impunity committed by the Mexican government and its police. Official statements from the tour affirm [...] "The problem is Mexico has a long history documented by Mexican and foreign human rights organizations, other governments, and international organizations of using torture to extract confessions which are then used to construct narratives to protect criminals, the police, military officers, government officials, and politicians … Consequently, many people have no faith in the government's account and have demanded that the investigations continue." [...] Relatives met with students, teachers, and laborers, pleading for the United States to intervene in the crisis. Moreover, the relatives asked elected officials to rethink U.S. foreign policy as it pertains to Mexico, specifically in regards to the Mérida Initiative. Many believe that these funds are being used to suppress the people, rather than fight the drug cartels. Caravana 43 achieved relative success in the United States. After meeting with the groups, several legislators voiced public support for their effort. Cristina Garcia, a California Assembly member stated, [...] "It's a human rights violation that's been going on and it affects a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> these students… [...] has the responsibility to affect change with our border country." [...] Crowds were gathered at each stop and thousands of people joined in social media platforms to promote the tour. The project served as a unifying mechanism not only across international borders, but also for Latino communities within the United States. Following the end of Caravana 43 in the U.S., the parents, students, and advocates hope to continue in their search for truth by organizing similar tours across South America and Europe.|$|E

In this setting, standard model checking techniques are often too expensive or too limiting, whereas testing techniques often do not cover enough of the state space.

Then, using an abstraction function specified by the user, our tool generates from these traces an abstract state transition diagram of the system, which can be nicely visualized and thus greatly helps in debugging the system. Lastly, formal requirements of the system specified in temporal logic can be checked automatically to hold for the generated abstract state transition diagram. Because the state transition diagram is abstract, {{we know that the}} checked requirements hold for a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> traces <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the traces we actually ran.

Gently bending a slice must then roughly maintain this curvature (assuming the bend is roughly a local isometry). If one bends a slice horizontally along a radius, non-zero principal curvatures are created along the bend, dictating that the other principal curvature at these points must be zero. This creates rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the fold, an attribute desirable when eating pizza, as it holds its shape long enough to be consumed without a mess. This same principle is used for strengthening in [...] materials, most familiarly corrugated fiberboard and corrugated galvanised iron, and in some forms of potato chips.|$|R
