5|$|Brescia's {{army was}} easily dispersed, and Constantine quickly {{advanced}} to Verona, where a large Maxentian force was camped. Ruricius Pompeianus, {{general of the}} Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect, was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the Adige. Constantine sent a small force north of the town {{in an attempt to}} cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege. Ruricius gave Constantine the slip and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to <b>let</b> <b>up</b> on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia, Mutina (Modena), and Ravenna. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.|$|E

25|$|The band at {{the sugar}} camp was {{notified}} of the settlers' {{return to the}} cabins by a young warrior who had observed them arriving. While the settlers ate dinner, a group from the sugar camp quietly concealed themselves in the underbrush and approached Ament's cabin undetected. There were Potawatomi among the band, {{one of whom was}} a son to Chief Meommuse. The group has been named responsible for the May 21 Indian Creek massacre and the murder of a minister, Adam Payne, on the road to Ottawa. This particular group of Potawatomi was under the leadership of Mike Girty. As the men socialized after dinner, the Potawatomi waited in the brush, intending to attack the settlers as they left the cabin, but as they waited it began to rain.

25|$|In week 12, the 4–6 Golden Hurricane {{traveled}} to Hattiesburg {{to play a}} must-win game for bowl eligibility. Charles Clay had a career-best 142 yards receiving with two touchdown catches and two rushing touchdowns, but the Golden Eagles prevailed to keep Tulsa out of the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2004. Southern Miss scored on their first play from scrimmage and did not <b>let</b> <b>up,</b> racking up 28 more points in the second quarter including a 42-yard fumble return. Meanwhile, Clay ran for two touchdowns and caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from G.J. Kinne, who also ran for a touchdown. After several lead changes, the halftime score was 34-28 in favor of Southern Miss. In the third quarter, the Golden Hurricane offense fell flat while Southern Miss scored 10 unanswered points to seal the win. Tulsa managed another touchdown drive near the end of the fourth quarter but the two-point conversion attempt failed, giving the Golden Eagles a 10-point margin of victory. Kinne completed 32 of 46 passes for a career-high 396 yards with two touchdowns and one interception while Damaris Johnson had 17 catches for 196 yards, also a career-high.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{falling to}} the SDSU Aztecs in their conference opener in a very close game, the Runnin' Rebels responded with soundly {{defeating}} New Mexico, the preseason Mountain West favorite, at home {{in front of a}} sold out crowd as well as blowing out an up–and–coming Colorado State club that easily beat that at UNLV the previous year. Despite narrowly winning road games against Air Force and Boise State, UNLV was ranked #11 in the country, which set up for an early February Top 15 showdown against San Diego State, which won 9 of the last 10 meetings. In front of a rejuvenated UNLV student section and a capacity crowd, UNLV played a near–perfect game, only to <b>let</b> <b>up</b> in the closing minutes, but key defensive stops in the final seconds allowed UNLV to come atop 65–63. However, the Rebels blew an 18–point lead in the following game against lowly TCU, and despite scoring 97 points, they lost in overtime. This set up numerous road losses down the stretch, but still finished a respectable 9–5 in conference play and 3rd seed in the tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to New Mexico. Granted a six seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, the Runnin' Rebels were upset in the opening round to Colorado despite trimming a 21–second point deficit to 2 in a 68–64 loss.|$|E

25|$|Years {{go by and}} Rudolph {{has grown}} into adulthood. Returning home, he finds that his parents and Clarice {{have been looking for}} him for months. He sets out once again to find them, only to {{discover}} that they have been kidnapped by the Abominable Snow Monster. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him {{in the head with a}} stalactite, dazing him. Later, Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he'll find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Donner apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed Abominable Snow Monster whom he hired to be a tree decorator. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody's celebrating, Santa fears that he'll have to cancel Christmas if the storm doesn't <b>let</b> <b>up.</b> Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that it's light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island where the Misfit Toys to pick them up. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.|$|E
