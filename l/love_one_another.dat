25|$|Despite being unimpressed by Walford {{newcomer}} Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), {{the pair}} grow to <b>love</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{but the relationship}} deteriorates when Stacey discovers she has been impregnated by Bradley. When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father Max (Jake Wood) and they end up in bed. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, Tanya (Jo Joyner). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is expecting their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's daughter Lauren's (Madeline Duggan) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a one-night stand with Callum, which leads to them dating. They split, however, over his harsh treatment of her mother.|$|E

[...] Others, less moderate, will say, [...] "The Quakers love none but themselves:" [...] and if <b>loving</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and having an intimate communion in religion, and constant care to meet to worship God, and help <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> be any mark of primitive Christianity, they had it, blessed be the Lord, in an ample manner.|$|R

Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva [...] "was a valkyrie just as before".

500|$|Edgar Allan Poe {{was very}} close to his brother, as he wrote: [...] "there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother — {{it is not so much}} that they <b>love</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> as that they both love the same parent." [...] Edgar {{occasionally}} used the alias [...] "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem [...] "Lenore".|$|E
