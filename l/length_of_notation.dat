40|$|AbstractA new {{inference}} method, {{called a}} subgoal-extraction (SE) method, is proposed. It carries out deduction in a top-down manner, but {{makes it possible}} to overcome some drawbacks of the standard top-down inference technique. In particular, SE method allows us to avoid repeated consideration of equivalent subgoals, and it cannot fall into an infinite loop if the complexity of all terms occurring in a deduction is bounded. In the propositional calculus the number of possible deduction steps is linearly bounded in terms of the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> of input clauses. SE method is well suited for sequential as well as for parallel processing. An implementation of SE method is also briefly described, and some experimental results are presented...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{establish}} a systematic methodology for generating automatically different tessellations and double-layer grids (DLGs) following a defined and specific nomenclature proposed originally for such a task. This particular nomenclature defines the <b>notation</b> <b>of</b> mosaics and DLGs in a synthesized and unique manner, with the advantage that it shows how to generate and design them after the parameters expressed on their own names. As a result, by means of an algorithm and some computational codes, it is possible to recreate in 3 D any of those grids directly from their own names. Current nomenclature for tessellations is also analyzed, finding severe disadvantages, such as the excessive <b>length</b> <b>of</b> their <b>notations</b> or their non-uniqueness character. A new nomenclature is proposed in order to define and generate consistently and unequivocally n-uniform mosaics in a consistent manner with the current nomenclature used for the Archimedean (regular and semiregular) tessellations.

40|$|A type 1 {{function}} {{is a total}} mapping from N to N. We will denote the set of all such functions by N N. A type 2 functional is a total mapping from (N N) k Θ N l to N, for some k; l. More specifically, we will call a mapping of this sort a functional with rank (k; l). For type 1 functions, there is a well established notion of computational feasibility. Namely a {{function is}} feasible if it is computable in polynomial time on a Turing machine. More specifically, a function f is poly time {{if there is a}} TM M and a polynomial p such that for all x, M with input x computes f(x) and runs in time p(n), where n = jxj, and for x 2 N, jxj denotes the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the binary <b>notation</b> <b>of</b> x, that is dlog(x + 1) e.

50|$|In mathematics, abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> {{occurs when}} an author uses a {{mathematical}} notation {{in a way}} that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct intuition (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> may be made formally correct by improving the theory. Abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> should be contrasted with misuse <b>of</b> <b>notation,</b> which should be avoided.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the timbre system, Penderecki had to devise a system <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> to {{properly}} convey his intentions. Many aspects <b>of</b> traditional <b>notation</b> are restructured, such as the traditional use of measures. Instead, the score is divided into sections, with each section given a length in seconds. The <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> the sections vary from two to 25 seconds, and each is given a rehearsal number. In some sections of the work, the temporal processes within the sonoristic system become complex, with multiple entrances in several instrumental parts. To clarify his intentions, these sections are divided into seconds, with vertical lines in the score marking off each second. In Polymorphia, this occurs from rehearsals 11-24, 33-37, and 57-59.|$|R
