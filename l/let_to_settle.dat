40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a project funded by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE)) to study the use of epoxy to plug {{hurricane}} damaged wells. Some of the wells destroyed by hurricanes are damaged to an extent that vertical intervention from the original wellhead is not possible. These wells have to be plugged to prevent future flows through the well to protect the environment. Cement is usually the preferred plugging material because it is very cheap compared to other materials like epoxy. However, cement can easily get contaminated by sea water or brines present in wells as completion fluids. Therefore, {{to be able to use}} cement it has to be placed at the bottom of the well by drilling an offset well all the way to the bottom of the original well. Epoxy, on the other hand, being much more chemically stable can be placed at the very top of the well and <b>let</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> by gravity without fearing contamination. Therefore, in wells described above, epoxy can be much more economical than cement. Placing epoxy at the top of a well and letting it settle by gravity can also be more economical than using cement in other situations such as in a leaking annulus of a well where circulation in that annulus is not possible, or if a well that has been previously plugged starts leaking again after the rig has been removed. Placing epoxy in the manner described can be achieved without using a rig and therefore, would be much more economical than cement. One of the most important factors in this process is to be able to predict the settling velocity of the epoxy to be able to determine the required setting time of the epoxy so that the epoxy does not set prematurely. In addition, it is important to evaluate whether the epoxy can successfully settle to the bottom and how much of it will adhere to the pipe walls while freefalling. This thesis aims to design, build and run an experimental setup that would help study the settling velocity of epoxy. Some experiments were conducted to assess the effect of different parameters that might affect the settling velocity of the epoxy such as the epoxy?s density, the annulus size and the inclination angle. The results show that the settling velocity was proportional to the epoxy?s density. Also the settling speed was almost double in experiments done at an angle compared to experiments done at vertical position. The annulus size did not have any clear effect on the settling speed. The adhesion to the pipe walls was found to be proportional to the epoxy?s viscosity and angle of inclination and was inversely proportional to the annulus size...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand the characteristics of households who treat their water in the home. In promoting home water treatment, there may be valuable lessons to be learnt from countries with many home water treatment users. Methods: Responses to the new Demographic and Health Survey question on water treatment were analysed for 21, 972 Egyptian households interviewed during 2005. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between home water treatment and household characteristics. Results: 5. 9 % (CI 5. 2 – 6. 7 %) of households used home water treatment, mostly either home filtration or <b>letting</b> water stand <b>to</b> <b>settle.</b> Filtration use was significantly related to educational attainment and wealth, whilst <b>letting</b> water stand <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> was related <b>to</b> use of stoneware water vessels, groundwater sources, and water supply disruptions. Discussion: The Egyptian data suggest that 4. 5 million people use home water treatment and confirm some water handling behaviours reported elsewhere. Because of limited detail in the DHS data about the technologies used and their effectiveness, it is unclear whether this behaviour reduces waterborne disease. Further research should consider how such data can be augmented with additional information to address this question...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to perform a {{comparative}} study between the official method recommended by Brazilian laws and the electronic equipment of photometric measurement and ultrasound spectroscopy equipment for the quantification of total lipids of the ovine milk in order to check which equipment establishes the lipids level better. The experiment took place at Technology of Food Department in Santa Maria Federal University together with School Plant of Dairy products and Ovine culture Section of Zoo Technical Department. It was used twelve sheeps half Lacaune Lait blood, milked individually from the first to the tenth week of lactation. The milking was performed manually and the analyses took place after the refrigeration of the samples. Before executing the analyses, the samples were homogenized and soon after evaluated in terms of fat amount by three distinct methodologies: official Brazilian methodology through Gerber’s butyrometer (GB), electronic equipment of photometric measurement Milko-Tester® (MT) and ultrasound spectroscopic equipment Lactoscan 90 ® (LS), which all analyses were performed in triple. The reproducibility of LS equipment was 100 % for the analyzed samples, while MT equipment showed variability {{in most of the}} analyzed samples obtaining reproducibility of the results in just 22, 5 % of the samples. For the others samples the latter equipment obtained 50 % of overrated values and 27, 5 % underrated values. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} <b>let</b> us <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> that the analysis of ovine Milk by ultrasound spectroscopy is efficient for the fat parameter when compared to the official Brazilian methodology...|$|R

Although the British Band traveled with armed guards as a security precaution, Black Hawk was probably hoping to avoid a war when he reentered Illinois.

40|$|The {{goal for}} this flight was {{to repeat the}} auto land. We {{modified}} the flare guidance to track 0. 1 m/s descent rate instead of 0. 5 and increased the airspeed in flare to 16 m/s.

The flare guidance started very well, but stalled the aircraft late in the flare and resulted in a cartwheel. From {{a quick look at}} the data, this seems to be from a high pitch up that outran the auto throttle. We're considering increasing the theta and phi tracking bandwidth and putting in some reduced theta command limits in the flare to keep it from happening again (notionally, something like 0 to 8 or 10 degrees) ...|$|R
5000|$|Suriname has {{the oldest}} Jewish {{community}} in the Americas. During the Inquisition in Portugal and Spain around 1500, many Jews fled to the Netherlands and the Dutch colonies to escape social discrimination and inquisitorial persecution, sometimes including torture and condemnation to the stake. Those who were converted to the Catholic faith were called New Christians, conversos, and, less often, [...] "Marranos". The stadtholder of the King of Portugal gave {{those who wanted to}} depart some time <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them <b>settle,</b> and supplied them with 16 ships and safe conduct to leave for the Netherlands. The Dutch government gave an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> in Brazil. But most found their home in Recife, and merchants became cocoa growers. But the Portuguese in Brazil forced many Jews to move into the northern Dutch colonies in the Americas, The Guyanas. Jews settled in Suriname in 1639. In 1799, the British occupied Suriname. Although returned to the Dutch in 1802, the British reoccupied it in May 1804 and did not return it to Holland until 1816. Suriname {{was one of the most}} important centers of the Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, and Jews there were planters and slaveholders.For a few years, when World War II arrived, many Jewish refugees from the Netherlands and other parts of Europe fled to Suriname. Today, 2,765 Jews live in Suriname.|$|R

To make absolute peace possible, for example, people {{would not be allowed to}} choose whether they like their neighbors or not; they would not allowed to make art or to hate their rival teams (hear me: Lafayette/Lehigh—gone for disturbing the peace); everyone’s middle finger would be cut off as a preventive measure and people would be obliged to howl only polite words when they stub their toe.

Naples in turn expelled her Jews in 1497. Sephardi Jews faced great obstacles as France refused Jewish immigrants and the nearest refuge in North Africa was barred to Jews: the Spanish occupied the ports of Algeria and Tunisia, the Portuguese occupied northern Morocco. Furthermore, the independent Sheikhs of the coastal regions refused to grant access to the interior. The Sephardim who reached Morocco were the most fortunate of the exiles to North Africa.
