2500|$|Backed up by {{a simple}} beat and minimal synth arrangement, Saporta sings about finding the girl he’s been missing: [...] "Girl, I’ve {{been all over the}} world <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> / I’m known for taking what I think I deserve, and you’re overdue." [...] Sabi, {{provides}} the chorus and the [...] "la-la-la-la-la" [...] melody that carries the song as Saporta sings [...] "You make me feel that…," [...] but never quite finishes the thought. According to Monica Herrera, a writer from Rolling Stone, the song has a riff that suggests Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass".|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the southern nonviolent protest movement was muted in Harlem. [...] Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the black leader most respected in Harlem. But on September 20, 1958, Izola Curry, deluded into believing the NAACP was controlled by Communists, approached Dr. King at a Blumstein's book-signing, {{and asked him if}} he was Martin Luther King, Jr. When King replied in the affirmative, she said, [...] "I've been <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> for five years", then thrust a letter opener into his chest. NYPD [...] officers took King, still in the chair where he had sat, to an ambulance that took him to Harlem Hospital, for removal of the blade.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Gabe gets his picture taken in the photobooth, and when he's grabbing it, a picture of Sabi appears to be stuck in the slit. Both picture's feelings read [...] "Incomplete". Then Gabe makes his goal of the night to find the girl in the picture. While this is happening, Victoria Asher is seen dragging different people into the bathroom, these people including twins and a girl, hence her feeling being [...] "kinky". Gabe goes around the club (his [...] "world" [...] girl I've been all over the world <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>you)</b> trying to find Sabi and stumbling upon different people who embrace him in hugs or handshakes. Sabi is seen dancing around the club when her part of the song comes on. Nate Novarro instead of dancing, orders a burger through Vicky-T's iPad; his feeling being [...] "munchy". During the first two thirds of the video, all drinks seem to be taken away from Ryland Blackinton, hence why on his picture he's feeling [...] "thirsty". When Gabe finally finds Sabi, they give each other a look of sheer happiness, before they both enter the photobooth. The lights go off, and at the moment they go back on, Gabe and Sabi seem to be kissing. They take a new picture together, and it reads [...] "Complete", thus ending the video.|$|E
