40|$|We {{define the}} notion of {{asymptotically}} free for locally restricted compositions, which means roughly that <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> can often be replaced by any <b>larger</b> <b>parts.</b> Two well-known examples are Carlitz and alternating compositions. We show that <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> have asymptotically geometric distributions. This leads to asymptotically independent Poisson variables for numbers of various <b>large</b> <b>parts.</b> Based on this we obtain asymptotic formulas for the probability of being gap free and for the expected values of the <b>largest</b> <b>part,</b> number of distinct parts and number of parts of multiplicity k, all accurate to o(1).

40|$|We study {{two types}} of {{probability}} measures {{on the set of}} integer partitions of $n$ with at most $m$ parts. The first one chooses the random partition with a chance related to its <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> only. We then obtain the limiting distributions of all of the parts together and that of the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> as $n$ tends to infinity while $m$ is fixed or tends to infinity. In particular, if $m$ goes to infinity not fast enough, the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> satisfies the central limit theorem. The second measure is very general. It includes the Dirichlet distribution and the uniform distribution as special cases. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the parts jointly and that of the <b>largest</b> <b>part</b> by taking limit of $n$ and $m$ {{in the same manner as}} that in the first probability measure.

Another way of turning <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> is a sliding bed, which can slide away from the headstock and thus open up a gap in front of the headstock for <b>large</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
