5|$|A {{particularly}} severe {{outbreak of}} malaria struck the ship in early February 1804; 212 members of Bellerophons crew fell ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had {{to be transferred to}} a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died. She was ordered back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. She briefly paid off and was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. On 27 September four shipwrights working in magazine by candle <b>light</b> <b>set</b> off some loose powder. The explosion killed all four.|$|E
5|$|Shadow Dragon retells {{the events}} of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of <b>Light.</b> <b>Set</b> on the {{continent}} of Archanea, the story follows Marth, prince {{of the kingdom of}} Altea, as he is forced into exile from his lands when the evil wizard Gharnef and resurrected Dark Dragon Medeus begin their conquest of the continent. Forming new alliances with neighboring kingdoms, Marth must form a new army to retrieve the mystical Falchion sword and Fire Emblem shield to defeat both Gharnef and Medeus. The gameplay follows the Fire Emblem standards of turn-based battles played out on grid-based maps. Returning features include a character class system which evolves based on character usage, and permanent death for units defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|At a party {{hosted by}} her mother, Lansbury met John van Druten, who had {{recently}} co-authored a script for Gaslight (1944), a mystery-thriller based on Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play, Gas <b>Light.</b> <b>Set</b> in Victorian London, the film was being directed by George Cukor, and starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect {{for the role of}} Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with MGM, earning $500 a week and using her real name as her professional name. Upon release, Gaslight received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Supporting Actress for Lansbury.|$|E

25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to {{the window in the}} north wall. The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed <b>light,</b> <b>set</b> in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter and may have been used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E

25|$|The {{only time}} during World War II that a Holocaust train {{carrying}} Jewish deportees from Western Europe {{was stopped by}} the Underground happened on 19 April 1943, when the Transport No. 20 left Mechelen with 1,631 Jews, heading for Auschwitz. Soon after leaving Mechelen, the driver stopped the train after seeing an emergency red <b>light,</b> <b>set</b> by the Belgians. After a brief fire fight between the Nazi train guards and the three resistance members – equipped only with one pistol between them – the train started again. Of the 233 people who attempted to escape, 26 were shot on the spot, 89 were recaptured and 118 got away.|$|E
25|$|Four weeks later, Miss Jummy {{moved up}} in {{distance}} for the Oaks over {{one and a}} half miles at Epsom. She was made the even money favourite in a field of twelve fillies, with her most serious challenger appearing to be Braw Lass, a filly who had finished a close second to Minting in the Middle Park Plate. Watts restrained the favourite in the early stages as Storm <b>Light</b> <b>set</b> a very slow pace. Miss Jummy turned into the straight in fourth place before overtaking Storm Light approaching the final furlong. She won the race easily by half a length from Argo Navis, who finished strongly after being badly hampered, with Braw Lass a full length behind in third. The prize for the winner was £3,250.|$|E
2500|$|Martin's {{work has}} been {{described}} as having [...] "complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing" [...] by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer. Dana Jennings of the New York Times described Martin's work as [...] "fantasy for grown ups" [...] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical. Martin's first novel, Dying of the <b>Light,</b> <b>set</b> the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: [...] "Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic." ...|$|E

60|$|That night, {{watching}} {{from the roof of}} her house {{by the light of the}} full moon, Miriam saw Marcus ride away at the head of his band of soldiers. On the crest of a little ridge of ground outside the village he halted, leaving them to go on, and turning his horse's head looked backward. Thus he stood awhile, the silver rays of the moon shining on his bright armour and making him a point of <b>light</b> <b>set</b> between two vales of shadow. Miriam could guess whither his eyes were turned and what was in his heart. It seemed to her, even, that she could feel his loving thought play upon her and that with the ear of his spirit he could catch the answer of her own. Then suddenly he turned and was lost in the gloom of the night.|$|E
6000|$|How are the imprecations to be explained? The {{explanation}} is not difficult, nothing is difficult--to a comparative mythologist. Gladstone is the sun, {{the enemy of}} Darkness. But Darkness has her worshippers as well as <b>Light.</b> <b>Set,</b> no less than Osiris, was adored in the hymns of Egypt, perhaps by kings of an invading Semitic tribe. Now {{there can be no}} doubt that the enemies of Gladstone, the Rishis, or hymn- writers who execrated him, were regarded by his worshippers as a darkened class, foes of enlightenment. They are spoken of as [...] "the stupid party," [...] as [...] "obscurantist," [...] and so forth, with the usual amenity of theological controversy. It would be painful, and is unnecessary, to quote from the curses, whether matins or vespers, of the children of night. Their language is terribly severe, and, doubtless, was regarded as blasphemy by the sun-worshippers. Gladstone is said to have [...] "no conscience," [...] "no sense of honour," [...] to be so fugitive and evasive in character, that one might almost think the moon, rather than the sun, was the topic under discussion. But, as Roth points out, this is easily explained when we remember the vicissitudes of English weather, and the infrequent appearances of the sun in that climate. By the curses, uttered as they were in the morning, when night has yielded to the star of day, and at evening, when day is, in turn, vanquished by night, our theory of the sun Gladstone is confirmed beyond reach of cavil; indeed, the solar theory is no longer a theory, but a generally recognized fact.|$|E
