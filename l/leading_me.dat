500|$|Two {{projects}} helped Rimsky-Korsakov {{focus on}} less academic music-making. The {{first was the}} creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov, who approached him at Balakirev's suggestion. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by direct quotation or as models for composing fakeloric passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov. Glinka's sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother's musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to [...] "correct" [...] what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. [...] "Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me", he later wrote. [...] "Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, <b>leading</b> <b>me</b> as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style".|$|E

He was also influenced by theories he read of in Vladimir Lenin's State and Revolution as a teen.

2500|$|By 1846 Bourget {{found that}} many of his plans for {{expansion}} and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada were being frustrated by Archbishop Signay, who disliked Bourget and was distrustful of Bourget's changes. [...] On September 25, 1846, Bourget wrote to Signay and said, “For a long time I have been thinking that Your Grace should give up the administration of your archdiocese, contenting yourself with retaining the title of metropolitan. I shall use the occasion of my journey to Rome to put before the Holy See the reasons <b>leading</b> <b>me</b> to believe that it might be time for you to relieve yourself of this burden." [...] With this in mind, Bourget travelled to Rome in late 1846 to petition the Pope for Signay's resignation. [...] He was supported in this cause by Charles-Félix Cazeau, secretary to Archbishop Signay.|$|E

2500|$|Reception for OS X Mountain Lion has {{generally}} been positive. John Siracusa of Ars Technica said that 10.8 corrected and simplified UI changes made with Lion, saying that it had become [...] "what 10.7 should've been" [...] and that the faster speeds and features merit the upgrade, then adding that [...] "If we'd {{had to wait for}} two years after 10.6 for the next major release of OS X, chances are good that the worst of the missteps in Lion would just be landing on our doorsteps today. I'll take 10.8, thanks." [...] Many reviewers found that Mountain Lion was far more stable than its predecessor, including Jason Snell of Macworld, who said [...] "All told, I found Mountain Lion to be a stable, solid release. Even prerelease builds were far more stable than I've come to expect from OS X betas, <b>leading</b> <b>me</b> to wonder if Apple's new annual schedule is leading to more careful incremental updates (with fewer bugs) rather than great leaps (with more, nastier bugs)." ...|$|E

40|$|Macular edema (ME) is a common, final pathway {{for many}} {{different}} ocular and systemic diseases. The most common diseases include: diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vascular disorders (such as central and branch retinal vein occlusion), and uveitis. The complex and multifactorial pathophysiological mechanisms <b>leading</b> to <b>ME,</b> are still poorly understood. Inflammation plays {{a crucial role}} in the genesis of ME, as demontrsated by significant increase of different cytokines and chemokines, (besides vascular endothelial growth factors-VEGF) in ocular fluids. Currently, intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF drugs are the most used treatments in ME of retinal vascular origin. This review will address the most important (with highest level of scientific evidence and longest followup) results on the use of intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF drugs, starting from molecular basis to the most updated randomized clinical trials. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers...|$|R
5000|$|In {{recent years}} however, the album has been {{revisited}} by both critics and musicians with more sympathetic and favorable reviews. In 2011 music writer Steven Shehori included Squeeze in his [...] "Criminally Overlooked Albums" [...] series for The Huffington Post, {{and in a}} lengthy review of the album, offered the following positive assessment of Squeeze: [...] "if you pluck it from the shackles of its murky back-story, Squeeze {{is nothing short of}} a quintessential listening experience." [...] The UK band Squeeze took their name from its title according to band member Chris Difford, who also offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: [...] "It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. … In a retrospective way I really enjoy it. It has kind of a naivety about it". [...] In 1995, Doug Yule described the recording of Squeeze being [...] "like the blind <b>leading</b> the blind, <b>me</b> <b>leading</b> myself. That's what came out of it, I don't even have a copy of it. But it's kind of a nice memory for me and kind of an embarrassment at the same time.

6000|$|At last {{we came to}} {{the head}} of the cave, where there was a rock daïs almost exactly similar to the one on which we had been so furiously attacked, a fact that proved to me that these daïs must have been used as altars, {{probably}} for the celebration of religious ceremonies, and more especially of rites connected with the interment of the dead. On either side of this daïs were passages <b>leading,</b> Billali informed <b>me,</b> to other caves full of dead bodies.

60|$|The life I was <b>leading</b> made <b>me</b> both {{hardy and}} frugal. I never drank but water, and rarely ate {{anything}} more costly than oatmeal; and I required so little sleep that, although I rose with the peep of day, I would often lie long {{awake in the}} dark or starry watches of the night. Thus in Graden Sea-Wood, although I fell thankfully asleep by eight in the evening, I was awake again before eleven with a full possession of my faculties, and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue. I rose and sat by the fire, watching the trees and clouds tumultuously tossing and fleeing overhead, and hearkening to {{the wind and the}} rollers along the shore; till at length, growing weary of inaction, I quitted the den, and strolled towards the borders of the wood. A young moon, buried in mist, gave a faint illumination to my steps; and the light grew brighter as I walked forth into the links. At the same moment, the wind, smelling salt of the open ocean, and carrying particles of sand, struck me with its full force, so that I had to bow my head.|$|R

60|$|They evidently did {{not hear}} me, though we were {{afterwards}} to hear the reason for an apparent act of madness. Harry was always reckless, and Ormond coolly brave, while as I ran I saw the two horses flying at the wall. A streak of red flame blazed out low down in the snow, a mounted man passed <b>me</b> <b>leading</b> two horses, and I neither knew nor cared whether he noticed me, for I felt suddenly dizzy, wondering whether the bullet had gone home. Neither did I hear any report at all, for my whole attention was concentrated on the black shapes of the riders breast high beyond the wall. Then one beast rose into the air, and I saw Ormond swing a riding crop round backward as though for the sword cut from behind the shoulder. A soft thud followed, Harry's horse cleared the sods like a bird, and I blazed off my rifle at a venture toward the hollow as they thundered neck and neck past me. It was clear that empty-handed they had ridden either over or through the foe.|$|R
