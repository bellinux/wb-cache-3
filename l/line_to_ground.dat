5000|$|At the {{physical}} layer, both SCL and SDA lines are of open-drain design, thus pull-up resistors are needed. A logic [...] "0" [...] is output by pulling the <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground,</b> and a logic [...] "1" [...] is output by letting the line float (output high impedance) {{so that the}} pull-up resistor pulls it high. A line is never actively driven high. This wire-ANDing allows multiple nodes to connect to the bus without short circuits from signal contention. High-speed systems (and some others) may use a current source instead of a resistor to pull-up on SCL or both SCL and SDA, to accommodate higher bus capacitance and enables faster rise times.|$|E

In this study, the system model with two SFCLs installed at each generator terminal was used taking 3 LG (three <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground)</b> fault at 12 fault points into account. These analyses were performed using EMTP/ATP. It is concluded that the use of SFCL with shunt resistance value of about 1. 0 pu is effective for all fault points for the improvement of power system transient stability and the limiting of fault current...|$|R

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of fault currents differ widely {{depending on the}} type of earthing system used, the installation's supply type and earthing system, and its proximity to the supply. For example, for a domestic UK 230 V, 60 A TN-S or USA 120 V/240 V supply, fault currents may be a few thousand amperes. Large low-voltage networks with multiple sources may have fault levels of 300,000 amperes. A high-resistance-grounded system may restrict <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault current to only 5 amperes. Prior to selecting protective devices, prospective fault current must be measured reliably at the origin of the installation and at the furthest point of each circuit, and this information applied properly to the application of the circuits.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} marine {{instruments are}} newly {{inserted in the}} trade and industry, for which {{the existence of an}} equipped and reliable power system is necessitated. One of the features of such a power system is that it cannot have an earth system causing the protection relays {{not to be able to}} detect the single <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> short circuit fault. While on the other hand, the occurrence of another similar fault at the same time can lead to the double line fault and thereby the tripping of relays and shortening of vital loads. This in turn endangers the personals' security and causes the loss of military plans. From the above considerations, it is inferred that detecting the single <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault in the marine instruments is of a special importance. In this way, this paper intends to detect the single <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault in the power systems of the marine instruments using the wavelet transform and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In the numerical analysis, several different types of short circuit faults are simulated on several marine power systems and the proposed approach is applied to detect the single <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault. The results are of a high quality and preciseness and perfectly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In the {{deregulated}} electricity market, total transfer capability (TTC) is {{a measure}} of the network capability for further commercial activity above the already committed uses. This paper deals with the development of an interior point nonlinear programming methodology for evaluating Dynamic TTC. By establishing a novel method for integrating transient stability constraints into conventional steady-state TTC problem, we have proposed the dynamic TTC solution methodology using a Transient Stability Constrained OPF. In the TSCOPF based TTC formulation, we have assumed that three phase <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> faults will occur in the simulation period. In Japan, power system operator considers more severe faults conditions, like 3 phases 4 <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> fault with double circuits (3 φ 4 LG). In this paper, we will propose a solution of Transient Stability Constrained OPF with unbalanced faults, where three phase transmission model was considered in the dynamic simulation period.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{balanced}} <b>line</b> is <b>to</b> transfer a "signal " {{from one place to}} another while rejecting "ground noise", which is not white noise or hiss, but power line related hum and buzz.

Since anything connected <b>to</b> the <b>line</b> affects its impedance, always consider the "system " consisting of the driver, the line itself, and the receiver. It is a popular belief that the signals must have opposing polarity and equal amplitudes, or symmetry. Signal symmetry has NOTHING to do with noise rejection. The system must reject noise even when there is no signal and, in fact, this is usually how system noise testing is done.

25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation {{to a degree that}} allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power <b>lines</b> and chassis, <b>to</b> suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground.</b> If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{system needs}} to be {{protected}} against voltage sags, swells that adversely affect the reliability & quality of power supply at the utility end. These problems can be mitigated with voltage injection method using custom power device, Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). In this paper we design a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) which is utilized for power quality improvement. The main power quality problems like voltage sag and swell are studied in this paper. The device used to phase out voltage sags and a swell in the distribution lines is the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). The DVR can restore the load voltage within few milliseconds by injecting series voltage which is actually missing voltage in to system through series connected booster transformer, when it is subjected to voltage sags. Generally DVR can be connected to grid through inverter topologies such as Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) or Current Source Inverter (CSI). This device can be implemented to protect a group of medium or low voltage consumers.
