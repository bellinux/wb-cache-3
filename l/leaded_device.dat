40|$|Current {{standard}} {{surface mount}} {{devices such as}} peripheral leaded packages and area array (Ball Grid Array) devices offer robust assembly yields and good long term solder joint reliability. While standard packages are robust, the drive towards miniaturization continues to force the creation of smaller silicon packaging. When developing a new device or packaging method, {{it is critical that}} these must compare to or perform better than standard devices. Not only should the new device perform well in assembly, they must show acceptable package and solder joint reliability in order to gain acceptance and wide use. In an attempt to achieve the functionality and density of bare die assembly, a series of devices known as Chip Scale Packages (CSP), have been developed by the packaging industry which are very close to the dimensions of the bare silicon. CSPs have emerged as an area array packaging alternative for applications requiring low to medium input / output counts on limited Printed Circuit Board (PCB) real estate. Due to their leadless (in general) configuration, larger ball pitch, and compatibility with existing standard surface mount PCB assembly equipment, CSPs avoid a significant segment of the assembly problems encountered in fine pitch peripheral <b>leaded</b> <b>device</b> assembly. While CSPs have been used extensively in low I/O areas such as memory applications, use of CSPs in more demanding environments and applications has been adopted less readily. The trend towards minimal package design is apparent with the release of numerous wafer scale packages, which are often Si die with one or more redistribution layers. With the creation of minimally packaged die (wafe...|$|E

5000|$|The three <b>leaded</b> <b>devices</b> {{depicted}} {{at the top}} of {{the page}} are generally two common cathode connected varicaps in a single package. In the consumer AM/FM tuner depicted at the right, a single dual-package varicap diode adjusts both the passband of the tank circuit (the main station selector), and the local oscillator with a single varicap for each. This is done to keep costs down [...] - [...] two dual packages could have been used, one for the tank and one for the oscillator, four diodes in all, and this was what was depicted in the application data for the LA1851N AM radio chip. Two lower-capacitance dual varactors are used in the FM section which operates at a frequency about one hundred time greater and are highlighted by red arrows. In this case four diodes are used, one dual package each for the tank/bandpass filter and the local oscillator.|$|R
40|$|A nickel/palladium (Ni/Pd) lead finish for {{integrated}} circuits (IC) {{was introduced in}} 1989. In 1998, solderability test results were published on Ni/Pd-finished components using a Sn/Ag/Cu/Sb lead-free (Pb-free) solder paste and printed wiring board (PWB) pads coated with organic solderability preservative (OSP). Since then, {{a number of other}} Pb-free solder alloys have been introduced. This evaluation shows soldering and reliability performance of Ni/Pd-finished components with the leading Pb-free solder alloys now being considered by the electronics industry. The ICs tested were 20 -pin small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) and 56 -pin shrink small-outline package (SSOP) gull-wing <b>leaded</b> <b>devices</b> finished with four-layer Ni/Pd. The solder alloys were Sn/Pb/Ag (control), Sn/Ag/Cu, Sn/Bi, Sn/Ag/Cu/Sb, Sn/Zn/Bi, and Sn/Zn. The land pads on the test PWB were coated with an OSP. Using Pb-free Ni/Pd-finished components, a Pb-free solder alloy, and an OSP coating, a Pb-free assembly was achieved and evaluated. Additionally, Ni/Pd/Au-finished IC leads were soldered using the Sn/Ag/Cu paste. Evaluations of each alloy included visual appearance, lead pull before and afte...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} physical sizes and configurations, including <b>leaded</b> <b>devices</b> and surface mounted chips. Leaded styles include molded and conformally coated parts with axial and radial leads. However, the basic capacitor element is similar for all styles. It is called a chip and consists of formulated dielectric materials which have been cast into thin layers, interspersed with metal electrodes alternately exposed on opposite Ceramic dielectric materials can be formulated {{with a wide range of}} characteristics. The EIA standard for ceramic dielectric capacitors (RS- 198) divides ceramic dielectrics into the following classes: Class I: Temperature compensating capacitors, suitable for resonant circuit application or other applications where high Q and stability of capacitance characteristics are required. Class I capacitors have predictable temperature coefficients and are not effected by voltage, frequency or time. They are made from materials which are not ferro-electric, yielding superior stability but low volumetric efficiency. Class I capacitors are the most stable type available, but have the lowest volumetric efficiency. Class II: Stable capacitors, suitable for bypass or coupling applications or frequency discriminating circuits where Q and stability of capacitance characteristics are not of major importance. Class II capacitors have temperature characteristics of Â± 15 % or less. They are made from materials which are ferro-electric, yielding higher volumetric efficiency but less stability. Class II capacitors are affected by temperature, voltage, frequency and time. edges of the laminated structure. The entire structure is fired at high temperature to produce a monolithic block which provides high capacitance values in a small physical volume. After firing, conductive terminations are applied to opposite ends of the chip to make contact with the exposed electrodes.
