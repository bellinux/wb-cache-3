It occupied a rectangular area, extending from the small river or stream at {{the western end of}} the inlet, about one furlong eastward; and from the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> thirty yards up the strand. The lower or seaward portion of the forest area, occupying about two-thirds of its entire breadth, consisted of a brownish drab-coloured clay, which was crowded with vegetable débris, such as small twigs, leaves, and nuts. There were also numerous prostrate trunks and branches of trees, lying partly imbedded in the clay, without anything like a prevalent direction. The trunks varied from six inches to upwards of two feet in diameter. Much of the wood was found to have a reddish or bright pink hue, when fresh surfaces were exposed. Some of it, as well as many of the twigs, had almost become a sort of ligneous pulp, while other examples were firm, and gave a sharp crackling sound on being broken. Several large stumps projected above the clay in a vertical direction, and sent roots and rootlets into the soil in all directions and to considerable distances. It was obvious that the movement by which the submergence was effected had been so uniform as not to destroy the approximate horizontality of the old forest ground. One fine example was noted of a large prostrate trunk having its roots still attached, some of them sticking up above the clay, while others were buried in it. Hazelnuts were extremely abundant--some entire, others broken, and some obviously gnawed.... It has been stated that the forest area reached the spring-tide low-water line; hence as the greatest tidal range on this coast amounts to eighteen feet, we are warranted in inferring that the subsidence amounted to eighteen feet as a minimum, even if we suppose that some of the trees grew in a soil the surface of which was not above the level of high water. There is satisfactory evidence that in Torbay it was not less than forty feet, and that in Falmouth Harbour it amounted to at least sixty-seven feet."[79] ...|$|E

Second, the outer limits of claims toterritorial seas, contiguous zones and exclusive economic zones are measured from the baselines. All states will have to delimit at least one international boundary with a neighbouring state, whether adjacent or opposite.

40|$|Sulfidic seeps with methane {{ebullition}} {{were observed}} at the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> of intertidal sand flats {{at a number}} of locations in the Wadden Sea. Bioturbating fauna was absent in the seep areas but abundant in the more central areas of the tidal flat. At one site, the vertical methane and sulfate distribution in pore water was determined along transects from the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> toward the interior of the sand flat. The resulting two-dimensional distributions showed a plume of methane-rich and sulfate-depleted pore water reaching from a depth below 1. 2 m beneath the sand surface up to the sediment surface at the <b>low-water</b> <b>line.</b> The d 13 C of methane released at the seeps was 268. 6 %, indicating a biological origin. The 14 C signature of methane was clearly elevated by anthropogenic radiocarbon, which shows that the methane was formed less than 50 yr ago. The observations indicate an internal circulation, where water enters the sand flats in the central area and exits at the <b>low-water</b> <b>line.</b> Pore-water flow patterns in the sand flat during the tidal cycle were calculated from the surface topography and from the pressure distribution at the flat surface across the tidal cycle. The calculated flow patterns explain the measured methane and sulfate distributions and predict a residence time of the seepage water of about 30 yr. Intertidal sand flats act as one-way valves, passing water from the central surface through the interior of the flat to an outflow zone at and below the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> with a velocity of millimeters to centimeters per day.

40|$|Global {{sea levels}} are rising and this trend {{has been linked}} to anthropogenically-induced climate change. This {{phenomenon}} has raised concerns over a range of threats to coastal States and coastal-dwelling populations. While this paper reviews these issues, its main focus is on the potential implications of sea level rise on national claims to maritime jurisdiction. Such claims are generally measured from baselines along the coast. The paper examines, in particular, the predominant type of baseline used by coastal States, that is, 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 baselines coinciding with low water lines along the coast. The traditional implication of using the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> as the basis for measuring maritime claims is that as the low water line along the coast changes or 2 ̆ 2 ambulates, 2 ̆ 2 so too will the maritime limits measured from it. As sea levels rise, normal baselines are likely to retreat inland leading to potentially substantial losses in the areas of nationally-claimed maritime spaces. Options to preserve the maritime claims of coastal States threatened by sea level rise are explored. It is argued that there is a growing need for a departure from the traditional norm of ambulatory normal baselines and consequently shifting maritime jurisdictional limits in the interests of providing marine users with stability, clarity and certainty...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has {{for many}} years used small boats (launches) to conduct surveys in shallow water {{for the purpose of}} {{nautical}} charting. Prior to WW II, soundings would have been taken by leadline, pro-viding depths and often some limited information about the seafloor type at each sample. For about the next half-cen-tury, soundings were acquired by single-beam echosounder, which evolved from wide-beam analogue equipment to modern digital narrow-beam sounders with capacity for clas-sification of the returning acoustic pulse. Seabed samples (for charting purposes) were acquired in a separate oper-ation involving either an armed leadline or grab samplers deployed using a winch. Sidescan sonars evolved from an oblique-looking single-beam transducer to modern high-res-olution systems of today. In the last decade, most shallow-water surveys have been conducted using multibeam echosounder systems (MBES); for practical reasons we limit the minimum operational depths to about 10 meters. Bathymetric (phase-measur-ing) sidescan sonars (BSSS) may allow us to look from this operational depth limit into the shoreline. For the moment, however, the way we collect bathymetry using these mod-ern tools is leaving a gap between the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> and the adjacent survey data.

40|$|Broadscale habitat use by Eastern Curlews (Numenius madagascariensis) {{in their}} non-breeding range in eastern Australia was {{assessed}} using low tide surveys on feeding grounds, where 60 skilled volunteers made repeated counts of the birds on intertidal flats, across 41 % (9500 ha) of the intertidal habitat within Moreton Bay, Australia. We analysed 32 defined sections of intertidal flat, of roughly equal area (mostly 200 - 400 ha), which varied greatly in their curlew density (2 - 47 birds per 100 ha) and also in substrate and other environmental features. Sites with the least resistant substrates had densities three times those with the most resistant substrates. Of 10 environmental characteristics measured for each site, substrate resistance was {{the best predictor of}} curlew density (r 2 = 0. 45). Characteristics that were poor predictors included distance to the nearest roost, level of human disturbance and distance to urban settlement. For a finer-scale assessment, microhabitat use and feeding behaviour were recorded during low tide within 12 intertidal flats, which varied in size (23 - 97 ha), substrate, topography and other features. Across all flats, curlews strongly preferred to feed relatively close (0 - 50 m) to the <b>low-water</b> <b>line.</b> They fed on a variety of substrates (including sand, sandy-mud, mud and seagrass) in broadly similar proportions to their occurrence in the habitat.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} component of any marine cadastre is the accurate {{positioning of the}} baseline since this defines the landward limit of marine parcels. Typically the maritime baseline is based on some form of Low Water Mark (LWM). However, it is notoriously difficult to determine {{the location of the}} baseline since within the highly dynamic coastal environment, the LWM is continually shifting. The primary aim of this research is to develop a methodology to efficiently determine the baseline by acquiring an integrated terrestrial Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using DGPS and a marine DTM based on near-shore bathymetry and tidal data, in order to derive the location of the baseline at a particular time. Fieldwork was carried out at Millport, Scotland using DGPS and marine radio-echo sounding to generate DTMs, which were then compared with external elevation measurements from SRTM, ASTER GDEM and NEXTMAP datasets. This method produced more robust results than those derived from existing datasets. Low-water lines (e. g. MLWS, LAT) were generated and compared to their locations shown on the current Ordnance Survey and Admiralty maps and charts. Results show highly accurate low-water lines (LAT) were produced using this method and that LAT has moved inland, likely due to a combination of sediment loss and sea level rise. A second objective was to review maritime baseline policy of other coastal countries, especially those neighbouring Malaysia. It was found that most coastal countries have a multitude of coastal management policies and initiatives to manage their coastal environment sustainably but policy design to sustain the integrity and position of the maritime baseline is almost non-existent. Such a finding also applies to Malaysia’s land and marine related legislation and coastal zone management initiatives. The principal conclusion is that the approach demonstrated here is an efficient and repeatable way to derive the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> along small segments of coastline for the needs of a marine cadastre but that there is an overriding need for an integrated and sustained policy to establish and regularly update the maritime baseline in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Wind-driven (aeolian) sand {{transport}} {{from the}} beach is of prime importance to coastal dune formation and growth, as well as dune recovery after a severe storm. The amount of aeolian sand transport is not only determined by wind speed, but also by beach surface characteristics, predominantly moisture content. The surface moisture content is determined by processes in the atmosphere (evaporation and precipitation) and in the groundwater (via capillary transport). The groundwater level below the beach is governed mostly by the tide. However, the exact importance of the tide in determining surface moisture content is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aims to find this relation, {{in order to better}} understand and predict aeolian sediment transport patterns in the future. A six-week field campaign was performed at the Sand Motor in fall 2014. Sea surface elevation was measured with a pressure transducer below the <b>low-water</b> <b>line,</b> while 8 dipwells were deployed to measure groundwater levels in a 80 -m long cross-shore array. A Delta T Theta probe was used to measure surface moisture content along the same array. It was found that the tide and the bed profile control the spatial and temporal patterns in surface moisture content. The tidal oscillations in the sea surface propagate into the beach, which makes the water table below the beach oscillate with tidal frequency. The inland water table of the Sand Motor is located 1 m above NAP. The slope of the water table is relatively constant, and it is independent of the slope of the beach surface. Therefore, a low beach slope results in an intersection of the water table and the bed surface. This gives a high surface moisture content. The water table affects the surface moisture content at the Sand Motor when it is within 0. 3 m below the bed surface. In this case the potential for aeolian sand transport can be reduced. A spring-neap tidal cycle was found in the amount of time throughout the day that this influence was present. During neap tide, the groundwater level was further below the surface, so the capillary fringe could reach the surface for a smaller amount of time. Therefore, the potential for aeolian sand transport will be highest during neap tide...|$|E
40|$|On nine {{beaches and}} two transects {{in the surf}} zone along the Dutch coast the {{presence}} of benthic macrofauna was studied in relation to basic abiotic characteristics. According to Short's classification system, Dutch beaches are mesotidal and dissipative (Ω = 8. 6), and the RTR is low (1. 52 - 1. 27), {{which means that they}} are not tide-dominated. BSI ranged from 1. 4 to 1. 1 for the northern and western Dutch coasts respectively and had an overall value of 1. 2. The rates of exposure of the beaches varied between 8 and 12, and are therefore regarded as sheltered to moderately exposed. The Dutch beaches display a geographical trend in beach types. Those of the Wadden Sea islands {{in the northern part of}} the Netherlands are dissipative, flat, fine-grained, and host high densities of many species of benthic macrofauna. The beaches along the western Dutch coast are less dissipative, steeper, with a higher mean grain size; the species diversity and abundance there are lower. Species diversity and abundance on the beaches increase from the high- to the <b>low-water</b> <b>line.</b> The maximum number of species was found between 0 and - 1 m relative to the mean tidal level. The abundance peaks just above the mean tidal level, while the biomass reaches a maximum at the mean tidal level.     Species diversity and abundance are low in the surf zone, but increase towards deeper water. Species numbers are high and the abundance is very high in the trough between the two bars.     The relation between the diversity and abundance of macrobenthic species on the one hand, and the sediment composition, water column depth, and position between the bars on the other show a clear pattern of zonation for the beach, surf zone and near-shore: (1) a supralittoral zone with insects and air-breathing crustaceans, (2) a midshore zone, with intertidal species, (3) a lower shore zone, whose species extend into the shallow surf zone, and (4) a zone of sublittoral fauna in the trough between the two breaker bars within the surf zone...|$|E
40|$|Belgium became officialy {{a federal}} state in 1993. The federal {{competence}} was reshuffeled {{and parts of}} it attributed to the Communities and Regions. Since the latter became competent in economic matters, it is mostly the redistribution of powers between the federal and regional level which is at order in this study. At first sight, a rather simple rule of thumb can be applied. All waters located on the land-side of the baseline, i. e. the <b>low-water</b> <b>line</b> in Belgium, belong to the competence of the Regions. All waters on the seaside of the baseline, on the other hand, remain a federal competence. This {{is the result of}} a basic interpretation given by the Conseil d’Etat in 1976. This body reached the conclusion that the territorial sea did not form part of the Belgian territory. Since the geographical situation is such that only one province borders the sea in Belgium, this interpretation was welcomed by the government at a time when the first steps of the federalization were being worked out. The territorial sea thus remained a federal competence, and the other maritime areas on the sea-side of the baseline followed this example. The application of this criterion of the baseline, it should be noted, sometimes leads to tensions between the federal and the regional authorities, as evidenced by the control of the quality of swimming water. But exceptions to this basic rule exist. First of all, a certain competence on the sea-side of the baseline has been attributed to the Flemish Region, such as the competence regarding pilotage, buoyage and towing at sea. Also the financial support of the fishing industry was regionalized. Secondly, the government has indicated its willingness to transfer certain other parts of its competence with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the territorial sea and the continental shelf. Even though this commitment was made in 1980, as of today no implementation has followed. Thirdly, new tendencies can be discerned. Recent opinions delivered by the Conseil d’ Etat, for instance, seem to establish a link between the international and external competence of the Communities and Regions. A kind, of Task Force has moreover been established within the Flemish Region with respect to the delimitation of the maritime areas with the Netherlands at the request. Of the federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the Regions have strictly speaking no competence in this area whatsoever, this development certainly contradicts the mere application of the above-mentioned rule of thumb. Fourthly, even in areas, which were transferred to the Regions, general police and shipping regulations remain a federal competence. Therefore, one can hardly consider this transfer of competence, which took place with respect to law of the sea matters in Belgium to be straightforward and well conceived according to a predetermined plan. Sometimes only accessories have been transferred, but not the essentials (ex. financial support of fisheries, but not fisheries at sea itself), at other occasions, some competence has been handed over, which should not have been touched upon ex. the custom and coastguard vessels, even though customs and police at sea remain a federal competence...|$|E
