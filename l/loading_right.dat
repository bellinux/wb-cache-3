40|$|Bone microdamage can be {{repaired}} through bone remodeling induced by loading. In this study, a loading device {{was developed for}} improved efficiency and the self-repair process of bone microdamage was studied in ovariectomized rats. First, four-point bending fixtures capable of holding two live rats simultaneously were designed. Rats were loaded and subjected to a sinusoidal wave for 10, 000 cycles. They were then divided into four groups to evaluate time points from 1 to 4 weeks in the microdamage repair process. The <b>loaded</b> <b>right</b> ulna was used for microdamage parameter analysis, and the <b>loaded</b> <b>right</b> radius was tested for mechanical properties. In all groups, microdamage consisted primarily of microcracks, which were observed in bone surrounding the force-bearing point. The values of the microdamage parameters were significantly lower at 3 weeks than at 2 weeks. However, none {{of the differences in}} mechanical properties between any four groups were statistically significant. This study shows that the improved application of loading in the form of bending for double-rat simultaneous administration was practical and efficient. These results suggest that microdamage was repaired between 2 weeks to 3 weeks after fatigue damage and microdamage is a more sensitive index of bone quality than mechanical properties...|$|R

But in reality the soil, the foundation and the frame act together as a single compatible unit. The non-linear response of soil is considered for this analysis.

40|$|Introduction: Attention modulates the {{availability}} of sensory information to conscious perception. In particular, {{there is evidence of}} pathological, spatial constriction of the effective field of vision in patients with right hemisphere damage when a central task exhausts available attentional capacity. In the current study we first examined whether this constriction might be modulated across both space and time in right hemisphere stroke patients without neglect. Then we tested healthy elderly people to determine whether non-pathological ageing also leads to spatiotemporal impairments of vision under conditions of high attention <b>load.</b> Methods: <b>Right</b> hemisphere stroke patients completed a task at fixation while attempting to discriminate letters appearing in the periphery. Attentional load of the central task was modulated by increasing task difficulty. Peripheral letters appeared simultaneously with the central task or at different times (stimulus onset asynchronies, SOAs) after it. In a second study healthy elderly volunteers were tested with a modified version of this paradigm. Results: Under conditions of high attention <b>load</b> <b>right</b> hemisphere stroke patients have a reduced effective visual field, over a significantly extended 'attentional blink', worse for items presented to their left. In the second study, older participants were unable to discriminate otherwise salient items across the visual field (left or right) when their attention capacity was loaded on the central task. This deficit extended temporally, with peripheral discrimination ability not returning to normal for up to 450 Â msec. Conclusions: Dynamically tying up attention resources on a task at fixation can have profound effects in patient populations and in normal ageing. These results demonstrate that items can escape conscious detection across space and time, and can thereby impact significantly on visual perception in these groups. Â© 2012 Elsevier Srl.

Such a curvilinear strip is maintained in equilibrium under self-equilibrated traction and equilibrated force applied {{on one of the}} edges, whereas the other three edges are traction free and subjected to zero volumetric fraction or zero equilibrated force. In fact, we study the case when one right or curved edge is loaded. Our aim is to derive some explicit spatial estimates describing how some appropriate measures of a specific Airy stress function and volume fraction evolve with respect to the distance to the loaded edge. The results of the present paper prove how the spatial decay rate varies with the constitutive profile. For the problem corresponding to a <b>loaded</b> <b>right</b> edge, we are able to establish an exponential decay estimate with respect to the angle Î¸.

Pressure loading did not alter fetal arterial blood gases or vascular pressures. The right ventricular function curve (stroke volume versus mean right atrial pressure) was not significantly altered by loading. However, the relation between right ventricular stroke volume and increased arterial pressure was dramatically shifted upward, indicating improved ventricular function after the 10 -day loading period. Normalized free wall of the <b>loaded</b> <b>right</b> ventricles became thicker (1. 2 + 0. 2 versus 0. 9 Â± 0. 2 mm/kg, p < 0. 01) and heavier (2. 7 Â± 0. 4 g/kg versus 2. 2 + 0. 4 g/kg, p< 0. 05) than control, and {{the ratio of the}} equatorial radius of curvature to wall thickness decreased (3. 2 +Â± 0. 5 versus 4. 5 + Â± 0. 9, p< 0. 005).

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the left ventricular (LV) function using the Tei index pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with lesion that result in a volume <b>loaded</b> <b>right</b> ventricle (RV). Methods: Retrospective data on 55 patients who underwent repair of a cardiac defect were analyzed. Patients with volume overload RV (n = 15) were compared to patients without volume overload but with other cardiac defects (n = 40). We reviewed pre- and post-operative LV myocardial performance index (Tei index). Tei index was obtained from transesophageal Doppler echocardiogram. Results: Patients with right heart volume overload, the mean preoperative Tei index was 0. 6, with a postoperative mean decrease of 0. 207 (P = 0. 014). Patients without right heart volume overload, the mean preoperative Tei was 0. 48 with no significant postoperative change (P = 0. 82). Conclusion: Pre- and post-operative transesophageal echocardiogram assessment provides an easy and quick way of evaluating LV function intra-operatively using LV Tei index. Preoperative LV Tei index was greater in the RV volume overload defects indicating diminished LV global function. This normalized in the immediate postoperative period, implying an immediate improvement in LV function. In patients without <b>right</b> heart volume <b>load,</b> consist of other cardiac defects, demonstrated no changes in the pre- and post-operative LV Tei.

We subjected aged (22 months) and young-adult (7 months) BALB/c male mice to daily bouts of axial tibial compression for 1 week and evaluated cortical and trabecular responses using microâ€“computed tomography (ÂµCT) and dynamic histomorphometry. The right legs of 95 mice were loaded for 60 rest-inserted cycles per day to 8, 10, or 12 N peak force (generating mid-diaphyseal strains of 900 to 1900 ÂµÉ› endocortically and 1400 to 3100 ÂµÉ› periosteally). At the mid-diaphysis, mice from both age groups showed a strong anabolic response on the endocortex (Ec) and periosteum (Ps) [Ec. MS/BS and Ps. MS/BS: <b>loaded</b> (<b>right)</b> versus control (left), p. 05). The loading-induced increase in bone formation resulted in increased cortical area in both age groups (loaded versus control, p <. 05). In contrast to the strong cortical response, loading only weakly stimulated trabecular bone formation. Serial (in vivo) ÂµCT examinations at the proximal metaphysis revealed that loading caused a loss of trabecular bone in 7 -month-old mice, whereas it appeared to prevent bone loss in 22 -month-old mice. In summary, 1 week of daily tibial compression stimulated a robust endocortical and periosteal bone-formation response at the mid-diaphysis in both young-adult and aged male BALB/c mice. We conclude that aging does not limit the short-term anabolic response of cortical bone to mechanical stimulation in our animal model. Â© 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R
