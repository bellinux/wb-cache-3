The reviewer {{also noted that}} it seemed <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the recording studio with the bands {{and he has not}} heard sound this good before. While using UE900s with Beats Audio, that is introduced in a number of HTC smartphones, he noted a significant improvement in the music he was listening to.|$|E
500|$|His view on {{the album}} soured as the years passed. In 1990, during {{interviews}} for his Sound+Vision Tour, Bowie commented that he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "mire" [...] while making this album, and expressed disappointment at having lost good songs by allowing the album's production to give the songs {{too much of a}} session man feel.|$|E
500|$|In Planica, Herzog quoted Steiner {{as having}} said that he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> an arena with 50,000 people waiting to see him crash. On {{the third day of}} the event, while talking to journalists after a jump, Steiner {{appeared}} jaded at the organisers' pressure on him to set more world records at the expense of his well-being: [...] "They let me jump too far four times. That shouldn't happen. It's scandalous of those Yugoslav judges up there who are responsible." ...|$|E

500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me." [...] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: [...] "My first cartoon, I had {{to be carried out}} crying It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, it was <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> another booth in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman did not renew his New Yorker {{contract}} after 2003. [...] He later quipped that {{he regretted}} leaving when he did, {{as he could}} have left in protest when the magazine ran a pro-invasion of Iraq piece later in the year. [...] Spiegelman said his parting from The New Yorker {{was part of his}} general disappointment with [...] "the widespread conformism of the mass media in the Bush era". [...] He said he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create. [...] Nevertheless, Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences, as had been widely reported, but because The New Yorker was not interested in doing serialized work, which he wanted to do with his next project.|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} in [...] "Mash-Up" [...] received mixed reviews. Joal Ryan for E! Online criticized the show's [...] "overproduced soundtrack", writing that Monteith was being edited {{to sound like}} Cher, and that when Morrison sang [...] "The Thong Song" [...] and [...] "Bust a Move", [...] "he sounded <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a music video, not a suburban high school." [...] He enjoyed Michele's [...] "What a Girl Wants", calling her singing [...] "raw and lovely". Entertainment Weekly Michael Slezak criticized the [...] "Bust A Move" [...] performance, writing that Morrison gave a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of the Young M.C. original. He was slightly more positive regarding the [...] "Thong Song" [...] performance, feeling that Morrison had [...] "a slightly less overwrought vocal than Sisqó", and observed that Salling did [...] "more than a serviceable job" [...] on [...] "Sweet Caroline". Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson called Morrison's performances [...] "pretty impressive", and MTV's Aly Semigran also enjoyed them, writing: [...] "We want more!". Goldman too was positive regarding Morrison's performances, noting: [...] "There is of course something completely dorky about seeing this guy perform these songs, but Morrison infuses Will with such enjoyment in what he's doing, he completely sells it." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Mortal Kombat X, he was {{designed}} by NetherRealm Studios character artist Solomon Gaitan, who initially referenced actor Yul Brynner when digitally sculpting Quan Chi's facial features. His final head render was described by Gaitan as [...] "reminiscent of his old look with a new flair", while series art director Steve Beran [...] "wanted me to merge Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff’s features" [...] during the design process, in addition to researching vultures: [...] "I wanted him to feel <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a permanent state of lurking and stalking; waiting for death to happen." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{sight of}} his {{littered}} desk was hateful to him. Starting early in the morning, Nicholas would disappear for the entire day, returning in the evening tired but cheerful, bringing with him flowers that Christina laughed at, telling him they were weeds. But what mattered names? To Nicholas they were beautiful. In Zandam the children ran from him, the dogs barked after him. So Nicholas, escaping through byways, would wander far into the country. Children in the villages around came to know a kind old fellow who loved to linger, his hands resting on his staff, watching their play, listening to their laughter; whose ample pockets were storehouses of good things. Their elders, passing by, would whisper to one another how <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> features to wicked old Nick, the miser of Zandam, and would wonder where he came from. Nor was it only {{the faces of the}} children that taught his lips to smile. It troubled him at first to find the world so full of marvellously pretty girls--of pretty women also, all more or less lovable. It bewildered him. Until he found that, notwithstanding, Christina remained always in his thoughts the prettiest, the most lovable of them all. Then every pretty face rejoiced him: it reminded him of Christina.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{him there}} {{in the office of}} a {{real-estate}} man--speculator, of course; everybody was, in Moffitt; but a first-rate fellow, and public-spirited as all get-out; and when Dryfoos left he told me about him. Dryfoos was an old Pennsylvania Dutch farmer, about three or four miles out of Moffitt, and he'd lived there pretty much all his life; father {{was one of the first}} settlers. Everybody knew he had the right stuff in him, but he was slower than molasses in January, like those Pennsylvania Dutch. He'd got together the largest and handsomest farm anywhere around there; and he was making money on it, just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> some business somewhere; he was a very intelligent man; he took the papers and kept himself posted; but he was awfully old-fashioned in his ideas. He hung on to the doctrines as well as the dollars of the dads; it was a real thing with him. Well, when the boom began to come he hated it awfully, and he fought it. He used to write communications to the weekly newspaper in Moffitt--they've got three dailies there now--and throw cold water on the boom. He couldn't catch on no way. It made him sick to hear the clack that went on about the gas the whole while, and that stirred up the neighborhood and got into his family. Whenever he'd hear of a man that had been offered a big price for his land and was going to sell out and move into town, he'd go and labor with him and try to talk him out of it, and tell him how long his fifteen or twenty thousand would last him to live on, and shake the Standard Oil Company before him, and try to make him believe it wouldn't be five years before the Standard owned the whole region.|$|E
5000|$|... "Doin' Time" [...] is {{a single}} by the American band Sublime and Maggie Plum. It is {{featured}} on their self-titled third album.

5000|$|He met {{his friend}} Joe Henderson at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. By this point, Spike had let his family ties {{go to his}} head and was insufferably arrogant and obnoxious.
