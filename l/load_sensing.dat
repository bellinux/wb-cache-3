40|$|In very dense networks, the {{performance}} of message broadcasting highly depends on the propagation conditions. In this paper, we investigate {{the effect of the}} path loss exponent in relation to the carrier sense threshold setting and the traffic intensity. We present a new analysis of the hidden node area in a broadcast network and compare broadcast outage probabilities for various traffic <b>loads</b> and carrier <b>sense</b> ranges. According to our model, the propagation environment (in particular the path loss exponent) has a major influence on performance. The traffic <b>load</b> and carrier <b>sense</b> range also affect throughput. A large attempted traffic <b>load</b> per carrier <b>sense</b> is preferred, since this gives the best performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{light of}} Japan’s low {{birthrate}} and aging pop-ulation, technology {{is needed for}} facilitating the activities of elderly persons {{as well as their}} caregivers. Wearable assist devices, such as the Smart Suit Lite (SSL) developed at our laboratory, are effective for this purpose. It is important to evaluate such devices from not only physical, but also from psychophysical perspectives. Experiments involving lifting a heavy object with and without SSL were conducted, and SSL was evaluated psychophysically. The muscle activity was mea-sured by surface electromyography. The psychophysiological evaluation was conducted by using the visual analogue scale, in which reductions in load of 22. 01 % for muscles and 19. 74 % for the <b>sense</b> of lumbar <b>load</b> were confirmed. This report proposes the human <b>load</b> <b>sense</b> model based on the sense of weight and the amount of muscular activation. This model is expected to find application in humanoid robots for robust evaluation of power assist devices...|$|R

50|$|A variant uses three wires, with {{separate}} <b>load</b> and <b>sense</b> leads at one end, {{and a common}} wire on the other. Voltage drop in the common wire is compensated for by assuming {{that it is the}} same as in the load wire, of the same gauge and length. This technique is widely used in resistance thermometers, also known as resistance temperature detectors or RTDs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{collision}} sensor system and reporting accident to police is an electronic device {{installed in a}} vehicle to inform police man in case of accident to track the vehicle’s location. This system works using pressure sensor, GPS and GSM technology. These technology embedded together to sense the vehicle collision and indicate {{the position of the}} vehicle or locate the place of accident in order to solve the problem immediately (as soon as possible). For doing so AT 89 S 52 microcontroller is interfaced serially to a GSM modem, GPS receiver, and pressure sensor. A GSM modem is used to send the position (Latitude and Longitude) of the vehicle, the plate of the vehicle and the SMS text from the accident place. The GPS modem will continuously give the data (longitude and latitude) and <b>Load</b> sensor <b>senses</b> the collision of the vehicle against obstacles and input to microcontroller. As <b>load</b> sensor <b>senses</b> the collision, the GSM start to send the plate of the vehicle, text message and the position of the vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude in real time...|$|R

40|$|A test {{apparatus}} provides an applied load to a monoball through a trolley which moves along a loading axis. While applying the load to the monoball, the torque meter is {{in communication with}} the spherical monoball, and a <b>load</b> cell <b>senses</b> the application of applied force to the monoball. Meanwhile, a rotary actuary imports rotary oscillating motion to the monoball which is sensed by a position sensor and a torque meter.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore aspects of identity-making {{processes}} among city dwellers in Bucharest, Romania. The unbounded and fragmented cityscape appeared as ambiguous {{as the social}} context, where a lack of positively <b>loaded</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging prevailed. Within this ambiguous framework, categories of Others proved to be vital for social orientation. On the basis of {{five and a half}} months fieldwork in Bucharest, I suggest that positioning in relations to Others are significant aspects of identity-making processes among Bucharest dwellers, and in particular, the young middle class. Others were represented in the social construct of gypsies and categories of ill-mannered Romanians. These internal hierarchical orders also reflect a wider context, wherein Romanians subordinate themselves in relation to an idealized image of the West. Subjects and objects for disdain were saturated by notions of the uncivilized contrasted, and compared to an idealized image of the civilized West. The common denominator that cut across various definitions of Others both inferior ones in terms of gypsies but also the superior one represented by the West, was this frequent reference to ideas of civilized and uncivilized This dichotomy, served as a navigator in identity-making processes, and was implemented by similarly positioned people to create a space where, positively loaded belonging emerged, while negative portrayals of Others functioned to strengthen this sense of belonging...|$|R
50|$|Mono-Jetronic is {{different}} from all other known single-point systems, in that it only relies on a throttle position sensor for judging the engine load. There are no sensors for air flow, or intake manifold vacuum. Mono-Jetronic always had adaptive closed-loop lambda control, and due to the simple engine <b>load</b> <b>sensing,</b> it is heavily dependent on the lambda sensor for correct functioning.|$|E

The guard's door controls {{were in the}} driver's cab; this eased conversion to one-man operation in 1983-4, the first LU line to do so.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of a depth-sensing indentation system is {{made possible by the}} inclusion of very sensitive displacement and <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems. Load transducers must be capable of measuring forces in the micronewton range and displacement sensors are very frequently capable of sub-nanometer resolution. Environmental isolation is crucial to the operation of the instrument. Vibrations transmitted to the device, fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and pressure, and thermal fluctuations of the components during the course of an experiment can cause significant errors.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} cyclicly {{applying}} a varying load to a material under test is described.

5000|$|Mechanical mounting: {{the cells}} {{have to be}} {{properly}} mounted. All the load force {{has to go through}} the part of the load cell where its deformation is sensed. Friction may induce offset or hysteresis. Wrong mounting may result in the cell reporting forces along undesired axis, which still may somewhat correlate to the <b>sensed</b> <b>load,</b> confusing the technician.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining wheel cylinder pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used). One such vehicle is the Jeep Comanche. The Comanche can automatically send more {{pressure to the}} rear drums {{depending on the size}} of the load. Most other brands have used <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> valves in the hydraulics to the rear axle for decades.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of a depth-sensing Reference Point Indentation system is {{made possible by the}} inclusion of very sensitive displacement and <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems. Load transducers must be capable of measuring forces in the newtonto micronewton range and displacement sensors are very frequently capable of sub-micrometer resolution. Environmental isolation is not crucial to the operation of the instrument because the reference point is isolated to the location of measurement. Vibrations transmitted to the device, fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and pressure, and thermal fluctuations of the components during the course of an experiment can cause errors, but these errors are typically not significant.|$|E
50|$|Any {{frequency}} lying {{below the}} cutoff and having its second harmonic above the cutoff can be amplified, {{that is an}} octave bandwidth. On the other hand, an inductive-capacitive series circuit with a large inductance and a tunable capacitance may be simpler to implement. By reducing the duty cycle below 0.5, the output amplitude can be modulated. The voltage square waveform degrades, but any overheating is compensated by the lower overall power flowing. Any load mismatch behind the filter can only act on the first harmonic current waveform, clearly only a purely resistive <b>load</b> makes <b>sense,</b> then the lower the resistance, the higher the current.|$|R
40|$|M. H. Marks Enterprises' Power Factor Controller (PFC) matches voltage with motor's actual need. Plugged into a motor, PFC {{continuously}} determines motor <b>load</b> by <b>sensing</b> shifts between voltage {{and current}} flow. When it <b>senses</b> a light <b>load,</b> it cuts voltage to the minimum needed. It offers potential energy savings ranging from eight percent up to 65 percent depending on the application. Myles Marks started out {{with the notion of}} writing an article for Popular Electronics magazine at the same time offering to furnish kits to readers interested in assembling PFC's. Within two weeks from publication he had orders for 500 kits and orders are still coming three years later...|$|R
5000|$|Q1 is {{the pass}} or output transistor. Rsens is the <b>load</b> current <b>sensing</b> device. Q2 is the {{protection}} transistor which turns on {{as soon as}} the voltage across Rsens becomes about 0.65 V. This voltage is determined by the value of Rsens and the load current through it (Iload). When Q2 turns on, it removes base current from Q1 thereby reducing the collector current of Q1. which is very nearly the load current. Thus, Rsens fixes the maximum current to a value given by 0.65/Rsens. For example, if Rsens = 0.33 Ω, the current is limited to about 2 A even if Rload becomes a short (and Vo becomes zero).|$|R
50|$|Many CNC tools also don't know {{anything}} about their working environment. Machines may have <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems on spindle and axis drives, but some do not. They blindly follow the machining code provided and {{it is up to}} an operator to detect if a crash is either occurring or about to occur, and for the operator to manually abort the active process. Machines equipped with load sensors can stop axis or spindle movement in response to an overload condition, but this does not prevent a crash from occurring. It may only limit the damage resulting from the crash. Some crashes may not ever overload any axis or spindle drives.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{increase}} in power brought by the new engine, the rest of the driveline was upgraded to be able to withstand the extra torque. The gearbox and differential were replaced by a version of those fitted to the TR and 2000 series cars, albeit with a close ratio gearset in the gearbox. The brakes were upgraded with new pad materials at the front, and the fitment of larger drums and a <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> valve at the rear. Other changes over the standard Dolomite included the option of a limited slip differential. The optional overdrive and automatic transmission from the 1850 model were also offered as options on the Sprint. Initial models were only offered in [...] "Mimosa Yellow", although further colours were available from 1974 on.|$|E
