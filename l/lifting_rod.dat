50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system ran {{vertically}} up the mineshaft, {{either to}} transfer {{power to the}} individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, {{in the case of}} man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (Holzlaschen). These joints were tightly bound {{to the ends of the}} lifting rods with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (Kolbenstangen). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (Kunstkreuz) was fitted to the lifting rods. Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (Kunstschloss). To balance the load it was usual to have two lifting rods.|$|E

Nowadays child often falls down in the borehole which is left uncovered and get trapped. It is difficult and also risky to rescue the trapped children to aid in such rescue we proposed a system of designing robots {{to the rescue of}} a child in a borehole. The robot structure consists of power supply, switch pad, gear motors, Oxygen concentrator, camera and Microcontroller. The condition of trapped child is captured with CCTV camera and monitored on a TV. A safety balloon is introduced in order to provide extra safety. Once the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> reaches a safe position under the child, an air compressor is operated to pump air to the bladder attached {{to the end of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> through an air tube that runs downwards inside the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod.</b> The bladder provides a safe seating to the child. When the child is secure, the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> is contracted to its maximum position. The motor is then reversely operated so as to unclamp the system. Simultaneously, it is lifted out of the well using a chain or rope. The programming language is Embedded C which is executed by MP lab Integrated Development Environment.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the output}} of {{software}} made in Visual Basic, an electromechanical implement lift system with position control was developed to maximize useful power of a low horse power (hp) tractor by replacing hydraulic system requiring higher power. It comprised of two lower links, one top link, two <b>lift</b> <b>rods,</b> one connecting rod and a power screw mechanism. The prototype was tested as per IS: 12224 - 1987 for recommended load of 150 kg on test frame and satisfactory results were found. The response time for lifting a load of maximum lifting capacity on test frame i. e. 116 kg and 110 kg for entire lifting range {{was found to be}} 71 s and 20. 7 s for single start screw and triple start screw, respectively as compared to 44. 7 s and 13. 3 s for lowering the loads. The position control of the system was also tested and found satisfactory with no drop in the height for maximum lifting capacity. The developed system could save 88 % of tractor input power compared to hydraulic system. Highlights • Design of an electromechanical implement lift system for low hp tractor. • Provision of position control system. • A single operator’s switch could operate the system and preset the depth. • Saving of tractor input power by 88 % compare to hydraulic system...|$|R

50|$|Sawyer is {{probably}} best remembered {{for the development of}} the ‘sunken nymph’ and the associated nymphing technique sometimes called the Netheravon Style. Sawyer’s nymphs were innovative in that they were tied with fine copper wire instead of silk or thread. This allowed the nymphs to sink and also gave them a translucent colouring when under water. Sawyer advocated the ‘sink and draw’ method of nymphing where the nymph was allowed to sink and then made to ‘swim’ towards the surface by drawing in the line or slowly <b>lifting</b> the <b>rod</b> tip. This was coupled with the ‘induced take' where the nymph was made to swim up in front of a fish thereby inducing the fish to take. The Netheravon style of nymph fishing learnt from Frank Sawyer was initially popularised by the naturalist, fly fisherman and television presenter Oliver Kite in his 1963 book, republished with a biographical introduction by Robert Spaight in 2000 Nymph Fishing in Practice.|$|R
50|$|All products, men and supplies, {{as well as}} {{recoverable}} ore, travels up {{and down}} the shaft in a cage. When the hemp rope or chains broke, the cage would plummet uncontrolled {{to the bottom of the}} shaft, killing its occupants or destroying its load. Cages were open to the front and rear, with I-beams on both sides to support the floor. The outside of the I-beams slid through wooden guides {{up and down the}} shaft, top to bottom. Spring loaded cages were designed with two swivel rods at the top of the cage, one each attached to the I-beams through bolts and lifted in the center. The outside of the rods were designed to be wider than the cage with a bulbous, round head at the end, notched with teeth molded into the rods. The weight of the cage being <b>lifted,</b> <b>lifted</b> the <b>rods,</b> released the teeth and tightened the spring, allowing the cage to move freely. If the chain or cable broke, the springs would force the rods down and the teeth would dig into the wood, stopping the cage.|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the time-dependent behaviour of the neutron population in a nuclear reactor in response to either a planned or unplanned change in the reactor conditions is of great importance to the {{safe and reliable operation}} of the reactor.

40|$|Background - Mechanical {{lifting of}} the {{abdominal}} wall, a method based on traction and consequent elevation of the abdominal wall, is an alternative procedure to create enough intra-abdominal space necessary for videolaparoscopic surgery, dispensing the need for intraperitoneal gas insufflation. Objective - This study aims to evaluate the technical feasibilility of this procedure {{to carry out a}} videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy, while analyzing the clinical and functional aspects of this technique. Patients and Methods - In the Digestive Tract Surgery Discipline of the Medical School at the University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, was created the equipment to perform videolaparoscopic surgery using this method. The equipment has two sections: an external part which consisted of a frame attached to the operating table, inside which there is a sliding steel cable, moved by a ratched which is located {{at the lower end of}} one of the frame rods; the internal rod, the support, has an "L" shape, and its horizontal branch is made up of three turning rods and which is connected to the steel cable after insertion into the abdominal cavity. Ten patients underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy using this equipment. The time taken to install the equipment, the operating area characteristics, the interference from the lifting equipment on surgical movements and on the intra-operative cholangiography, the measurements made of the force used during traction and extension of the abdominal wall elevation, and the medication required for post-operative analgesia were all evaluated. Results - There were no intra-operative complications, and in none of the cases was it found necessary to convert to open surgery. We considered the insertion a safe and uncomplicated procedure, and the traction system efficient. Apart from the elevation of the abdominal wall, the distribution of the viscera inside the abdominal cavity is fundamental for the operating area. Depending on the position of the epigastric trocar, the lifting equipment can interfere with the surgical instruments mobility. It may be necessary to reposition the support to perform the intra-operative cholangiography. The tensional force applied to the peritoneal surface by the <b>lifting</b> <b>rods</b> is small, and no additional post-operative pain was observed using this procedure. Conclusion - These results show that using the equipment described in this study, mechanical {{lifting of the}} abdominal wall is a feasible alternative for undertaking videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy...|$|R
50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main metering jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which <b>lifts</b> the <b>rods</b> out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R

In this design, the rod pump {{is placed in the}} vertical portion of the well above the deviated or perforated interval, while relatively low pressure-low volume gas is used to lift reservoir liquids from the deviated or extended perforated interval to above the rod pump. Once the liquids are raised above the pump, they become trapped above a packer and then enter the pump chamber where they are transported to the surface.|$|R
