It is {{found that the}} <b>lattice</b> <b>constant</b> of NaCl, CsCl structure ionic crystallites decreases with {{the reduction of the}} grain size. The <b>lattice</b> <b>constant</b> of ultrafine iron and nickel particles increases with the reduction of the grain size. As to the experiment result of γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystallites, the <b>lattice</b> <b>constant</b> increases with the decreasing of the grain size. It is opposite to the theoretical result of ionic crystallites, which reason is that the combination of most of atoms in γ-Fe 2 O 3 is by the covalent bond other than electrovalent bond.

5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The <b>lattice</b> <b>constants</b> are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
