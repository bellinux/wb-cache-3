40|$|The paper {{presents}} an extended structure {{for a minimum}} variance adaptive control system of an induction generator, which aims to improve its operating behavior under electrical short-circuit conditions. The basic design idea is to limit the control to physically achievable values, and thus increasing the robustness of the control system and avoiding an instability regime. A control <b>limiting</b> <b>block</b> is proposed and used for this purpose. Moreover, a short-circuit detector enables an on-line setting of the control penalty factor, {{improving the quality of}} the controlled output. All these additional customizations of the control system, implemented to keep the plant operational under and after a short-time short-circuit fault (acting as an abnormal perturbation), must also provide good performance in the normal operating mode...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{limiting}} norm, introduced by Pokrovskii (Soviet Math. Dokl., vol. 20, pp. 1314 - 1317, 1979), is generalized {{to that of}} <b>block</b> <b>limiting</b> norm. A resemblance of inequalities shared by both the <b>block</b> <b>limiting</b> norm and the structured singular value, introduced by Doyle (Proc. IEE, vol. 129, pp. 245 - 250, 1982), motivates further investigation of their relationships. To that effect, the concept of generalized spectral radius {{of a set of}} linear operators is introduced. It is then shown that, for block-structure of size less than 4, the <b>block</b> <b>limiting</b> norm is equal to the structured aingular value and that, in the general case, the <b>block</b> <b>limiting</b> norm is always no less than the structured singular value. Finally, better bounds are obtained for both the <b>block</b> <b>limiting</b> norm and the structured singular value...|$|R

25|$|It is {{hypothesized}} {{that there is}} an autosomally-encoded 'blocking factor' which binds to the X chromosome and prevents its inactivation. The model postulates that there is a <b>limiting</b> <b>blocking</b> factor, so once the available blocking factor molecule binds to one X chromosome the remaining X chromosome(s) are not protected from inactivation. This model is supported by the existence of a single Xa in cells with many X chromosomes and by the existence of two active X chromosomes in cell lines with twice the normal number of autosomes.|$|R

40|$|The {{throughput}} {{performance of}} incremental redundancy (INR) schemes, based on short constraint length convolutional codes, is evaluated for the block-fading Gaussian collision channel. Results based on simulations and union bound computations are compared to {{estimates of the}} achievable throughput performance with random binary and Gaussian coding in the <b>limit</b> of large <b>block</b> lengths, obtained through information outage considerations. For low channel loads, {{it is observed that}} INR schemes with binary convolutional codes and <b>limited</b> <b>block</b> length may provide throughput close to the achievable performance for binary random coding. However, for these low loads, compared to binary random coding, Gaussian random coding may provide significantly better throughput performance, which prompts the use of larger modulation constellations. For high channel loads, a relatively large gap in throughput performance between binary convolutional codes and binary random codes indicates a potential for extensive performance improvement by alternative coding strategies. Only small improvements of the throughput have been observed by increasing the complexity through increased state convolutional coding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for blind watermarking still {{images in the}} DCT domain with advanced features. Nine AC values will be modulated to implant an encrypted watermark. Eight of them represent one byte of the useful data to be hidden and the ninth bit re{{presents a}} key {{that will be used}} to scramble the message. Hence, the capacity of insertion is increased by 60 % while preserving the imperceptibility criterion. The watermark cannot be hacked because it is scrambled using an individualized key of almost random length and type, hence high level of security. The simulation results reveal satisfactory performance of the algorithm and an acceptable PSNR and <b>limited</b> <b>blocking</b> artifacts...|$|R

40|$|Terahertz {{time domain}} {{spectroscopy}} employing free-space radiation has frequently {{been used to}} probe the elementary excitations of low-dimensional systems. The diffraction <b>limit</b> <b>blocks</b> its use for the in-plane study of individual laterally defined nanostructures, however. Here, we demonstrate a planar terahertz-frequency plasmonic circuit in which photoconductive material is monolithically integrated with a two-dimensional electron system. Plasmons with a broad spectral range (up to ~ 400 GHz) are excited by injecting picosecond-duration pulses, generated and detected by a photoconductive semiconductor, into a high mobility two-dimensional electron system. Using voltage modulation of a Schottky gate overlying the two-dimensional electron system, we form a tuneable plasmonic cavity, and observe electrostatic manipulation of the plasmon resonances. Our technique offers a direct route to access the picosecond dynamics of confined transport in {{a broad range of}} lateral nanostructures. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the modular {{representation}} theory of diagram algebras, {{in particular the}} Brauer and partition algebras, along with a brief consideration of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. The representation theory of these algebras in characteristic zero is well understood, and we show {{that it can be}} described through the action of a reflection group on the set of simple modules (a result previously known for the Temperley-Lieb and Brauer algebras). By considering the action of the corresponding affine reflection group, we give a characterisation of the (<b>limiting)</b> <b>blocks</b> of the Brauer and partition algebras in positive characteristic. In the case of the Brauer algebra, we then show that simple reflections give rise to non-zero decomposition numbers. We then restrict our attention to a particular family of Brauer and partition algebras, and use the block result to determine the entire decomposition matrix of the algebras therein...|$|R
