Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are {{defined in terms of}} a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in Poetics because Aristotle states that drama consists of a <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.|$|E

So far, however, CRFs {{have only been}} considered for labeling sequences over flat alphabets. In this paper, we describe TildeCRF, the first method for training CRFs on <b>logical</b> <b>sequences,</b> i. e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms. TildeCRF’s key idea is to use relational regression trees in Dietterich et al. ’s gradient tree boosting approach. Thus, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of relational regression trees. Experiments show a significant improvement over established results achieved with hidden Markov models and Fisher kernels for <b>logical</b> <b>sequences.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|Beyond Han's sculptures which embrace organic forms, she {{has also}} {{designed}} geometric pieces. Four Dimensions (1993) {{was made up of}} ten geometrical structures, including single objects (such as Tetrahedron–Tetrahedron Interpenetration) and opened-up planes (Cubic Triangle) connected with each other through the use of angles, and light and shadow. Han said: [...] "My works are based on the concept of mathematical logic. The idea is to show how each step is based on the previous one so that the geometrical forms progress in <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> ... The fourth dimension is abstract. It cannot be seen or touched. It contains the feelings and talents of Mankind. We wish to possess this space and to open it up for all people to share." [...] Sabapathy was somewhat critical of these works, saying that they dealt only with techniques and fabrication and did not [...] "disclose fresh insights into space and its articulation". He expressed the hope that Han would stay the course and deepen her investigation beyond form into an exploration of light, colour and materials to [...] "create environments in which form, space and time can be seen to be related in ever-changing yet intelligent systems".|$|E
500|$|In the Crucifixion panel, van Eyck {{follows the}} early 14th-century {{tradition}} of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique. According to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, the episodes appear as [...] "simultaneous, not sequential" [...] events. Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels {{into a single}} composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a <b>logical</b> <b>sequence.</b> This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements. In the Crucifixion panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given {{the size of the}} mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the Last Judgement the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground. Pächt writes of this panel that the scene is [...] "assimilated into a single spatial cosmos", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the physical layout of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to the pages of a book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle and pops all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E
40|$|One {{approach}} {{to improve the}} accuracy of classifications based on generative models is to combine them with successful discriminative algorithms. (Fisher kernels) were developed to combine generative models with a currently very popular class of learning algorithms, kernel methods. Empirically, the combination of hidden Markov models with support vector machines has shown promising results. So far, however, Fisher kernels have only been considered for sequences over flat alphabets. This is mostly {{due to the lack}} of a method for computing the gradient of a generative model over structured sequences. In this paper, we show how to compute the gradient of logical hidden (Markov models), which allow for the modelling of <b>logical</b> <b>sequences,</b> i. e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms. Experiments show a considerable improvement over results achieved without Fisher kernels for <b>logical</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The series {{method is}} {{a variety of}} the direct method in that {{experiences}} are directly connected to the target language. Gouin felt that such direct [...] "translation" [...] of experience into words, makes for a [...] "living language". (p59) Gouin also noticed that children organize concepts in succession of time, relating a sequence of concepts in the same order. Gouin suggested that students learn a language more quickly and retain it better if it is presented through a chronological sequence of events. Students learn sentences based on an action such as leaving {{a house in the}} order in which such would be performed. Gouin found that if the series of sentences are shuffled, their memorization becomes nearly impossible. For this, Gouin preceded psycholinguistic theory of the 20th century. He found that people will memorize events in a <b>logical</b> <b>sequence,</b> even if they are not presented in that order. He also discovered a second insight into memory called [...] "incubation". Linguistic concepts take time to settle in the memory. The learner must use the new concepts frequently after presentation, either by thinking or by speaking, in order to master them. His last crucial observation was that language was learned in sentences with the verb as the most crucial component. Gouin would write a series in two columns: one with the complete sentences and the other with only the verb. With only the verb elements visible, he would have students recite the sequence of actions in full sentences of no more than twenty-five sentences. Another exercise involved having the teacher solicit a sequence of sentences by basically ask him/her what s/he would do next. While Gouin believed that language was rule-governed, he did not believe it should be explicitly taught.|$|E
