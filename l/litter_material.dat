In pure culture decomposition tests, Clitocybe sp. caused greater mass loss in partly decomposed leaves than in freshly fallen leaves, which was attributed to the greater mass loss of AUR and more selective decomposition of AUR in partly decomposed leaves. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that Clitocybe sp. was responsible for the selective transformation of the chemical structure of lignin.

However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms governing these processes, how they are regulated by the carbon in the host plant and the availability of more easily available forms of nitrogen sources. Here we used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine how the presence or absence of glucose and/or ammonium regulates decomposition of <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> and nitrogen mobilization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus. We found that the assimilation of nitrogen and the decomposition of the <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> are triggered by the addition of glucose. Glucose addition also resulted in upregulation of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative degradation of polysaccharides and polyphenols, peptidases, nitrogen transporters and enzymes in pathways of the nitrogen and carbon metabolism.

On the basis of spectroscopic analyses, three major types of chemical modifications of the <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> were observed, each correlated with the expression of specific sets of genes encoding extracellular enzymes.

This trial was an observational study of comparative character. Two experiments were conducted, with 960 birds each. Both experiments were carried out in a positive-pressure broiler house. Broilers were distributed in pens equipped with a bell drinker and a tube feeder each. In the first experiment, new wood shavings were used as <b>litter</b> <b>material,</b> and in the second, reused wood shavings were used. Two treatments with 16 replicates of 30 birds each were evaluated. The regular treatment consisted of dry and wet organic matter removal, followed by washing. The European treatment consisted of dry organic matter removal, humidification, washing with water under high pressure, detergent application, rinsing, and application of two combined disinfectants: glutaraldehyde 250 g/L + formaldehyde 185 g/L; p-chlor-m-cresol 210 g/L. Biosecurity measures were adopted during daily management tasks to prevent cross contamination between treatments. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by microbiological analysis performed before and after treatment applications, as well as by broiler performance results. Live performance results were similar between both treatments when broilers were reared on new litter. When reused word-shavings were used as <b>litter</b> <b>material,</b> the European treatment promoted better broiler performance.

The recommendations relative to the design and management of cubicle housing are, however, always subject to revision. Special attention is now being given to the improvement of animal comfort, particularly with regards to the lying cow. In this context, the level of comfort is estimated by the duration of the lying time, the frequency of the lying bouts and the ease with which cows are able to get up and lie down. The level of cow comfort is in direct relation to the softness of the floor, to the cubicle dimensions, and to the design of the lateral and frontal partitions. A soft floor can be assured through the use of either multilayer mattresses or a thick litter. Mattresses must be covered with a <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> that absorbs surface moisture and helps to ensure the cleanliness of the stall and udder. To achieve these objectives, the nature of the <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> (straw, sawdust, sand, lime, etc.) appears to be less important than the frequency of renewal. Cubicle floors covered with a thick layer (± 20 cm) of litter seem generally better appreciated by the cows than those equipped with mattresses, and their use is associated with a lower frequency of leg injuries as well as lameness. Sand appears to be a top-grade material for ensuring animal comfort. Nevertheless, the maintenance of a thick layer of litter demands an extra daily labor requirement and the handling of sand as a <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> requires specific equipment. There is a wide range of recommendations on cubicle dimensions due to differences in cow size and the need to take into account the cleanliness of the floor. Lateral partitions must be evaluated for their effectiveness in constraining the animal from spilling out into the neighboring cubicles while at the same time avoiding both injury and difficulties experienced by the cow in getting up and lying down. Finally, frontal partitions must be evaluated regarding their effectiveness in providing sufficient space to allow the cow to thrust its head forward as it stands up. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The result indicate d a significant  effect  of  different  litter  materials  towards  weight  gain  (P  < 0. 01), the  highest body weight  was found on  chicken treated with rice straw litter; there wa s  no effect  of <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> on abdominal fat percentage; {{there was a significant}} effect (P < 0. 01) of age towards rectal temperature; and there we re no  interactions  between <b>litter</b> <b>material</b> with age,  on body weight  gain,  abdominal  fat,  and  rectal  temperature.   Chickens  under intensive  rearing  in rice straw floored cages we re proven to have a mortality rate reduced by 3. 7 % in the starter phase. doi: [URL] [How to cite this article : Sulistyoningsih, M., Sunarti, D., Suprijatna, E., & Isroli, I.

40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{important}} for broiler producers to know litter production rates and litter nutrient content when developing nutrientmanagement plans. Estimation of broiler litter production varies widely in the literature due to factors such as geographical region, type of hous-ing, size of broiler produced, and number of flocks reared on the same litter. Published data for N, P, and K content are also highly variable. In addition, fewdata are available regarding the rate of production, characteristics, and nu-trient content of caked litter (cake). In this study, 18 con-secutive flocks of broilers were reared on the same litter in experimental pens under simulated commercial condi-tions. Themass of litter and cake producedwasmeasured after each flock. Samples of all <b>litter</b> <b>materials</b> were ana...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} a study which was conducted for SKB. The conclusions and viewpoints {{presented in the}} report {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily coincide with those of the client. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co (SKB) carries out extensive investigations on factors that can affect long-term storage of nuclear waste. Earthworms consume organic soil materials and when doing so they transport and mix mineral soil particles as well as <b>litter</b> and humus <b>materials.</b> Ants do not consume soil materials, but they collect and mix mineral soil particles and <b>litter</b> <b>materials</b> to construct their nests. This process of material displacement by earthworms and ants is called bioturbation and can be a mechanism for the redistribution (vertical and horizontal) of radionuclides within the soil profile. The aim of the present study was to determine the quantitative impact of earthworms and ants on bioturbation of soil in different ecosystems at Forsmark and Oskarshamn. Earthworms were sampled at four 20 × 20 cm 2 sub-plots at each site and were determined, dried and weighed in the laboratory. Gut passage time and faeces production were determined in a laboratory experimen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is current {{opinion that}} glass {{fragments}} {{can serve as}} an ignition source for grassland, bush and forest fires by focussing sunlight. In order to check the validity of this assumption, ignition experiments were conducted in the open over six litter samples taken from forests in northern Germany. Of several glass fragments, the five bottle bottoms best focussing sunlight were installed 15 – 50 cm above the <b>litter</b> <b>materials.</b> We found that one bottle bottom was able to slightly char spruce needles, beech leaves and blades of grass. Although this particular bottle bottom let the temperature increase up to 327 ◦C, flame formation did not occur. A secondary (but more realistic) experiment with a glass-bottle bottom lying on the litter led to a maximum temperature of 82 ◦C {{in the space between}} the litter and the glass fragment...|$|R
