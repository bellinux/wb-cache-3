5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS. The submission stated that the allocation of free units to industry was too generous {{and the length of}} the phase-out of free allocation was too slow.

5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power {{when compared to the}} {{environmental impact}}s of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{barriers to the}} widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E

The Directive established a 10% biofuel target. A separate Fuel Quality Directive set the EU's <b>Low</b> <b>Carbon</b> Fuel Standard, requiring a 6% reduction in GHG intensity of EU transport fuels by 2020.

5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

40|$|Enhanced {{biological}} {{phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) may deteriorate or fail during <b>low</b> organic <b>carbon</b> loading periods. Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in EBPR were acclimated under both high and <b>low</b> organic <b>carbon</b> conditions, and then dynamics of polymers in typical cycles, anaerobic conditions with excess organic carbons, and endogenous respiration conditions were examined. After long-term acclimation, {{it was found}} that organic loading rates did not affect the yield of PAOs and the applied <b>low</b> organic <b>carbon</b> concentrations were advantageous for the enrichment of PAOs. A <b>low</b> influent organic <b>carbon</b> concentration induced a high production of extracellular carbohydrate. During both anaerobic and aerobic endogenous respirations, when glycogen decreased to around 80 ± 10 [*]mg C per gram of volatile suspended solids, PAOs began to utilize polyphosphate significantly.

40|$|Sporting mega-events {{generate}} substantial {{carbon footprint}} where return transportation of event participants and visitors between {{the source and}} host countries makes the largest contribution. To enhance environmental sustainability of sporting mega-events, it is paramount to select a host country with the <b>lowest</b> <b>carbon</b> footprint from international transportation without compromising the magnitude of major visitor flows. The Facility Location Problem (FLP) model represents an established tool employed in the business environment {{to determine the best}} location for the installation of facilities to provide for existing or envisaged consumer demand. The model has proven its feasibility in a number of economic sectors, but rarely been applied in tourism, and never with sustainability management and planning purposes. This study contributes to knowledge by demonstrating the applicability of the FLP model when planning for sporting mega-events. The model enables selection of a host country with better climate credentials by quantifying the magnitude of international transportation of the event participants alongside the associated carbon footprint. Application of the FLP model to the FIFA World Cups shows that, to facilitate the progress of these mega-events towards sustainability, a decision on a host country should be made after the team qualification round, rather than before, as it currently stands. The model can then identify prospective hosts with the <b>lowest</b> <b>carbon</b> footprint from international transportation...|$|R
