The so connected elements are subject to mutual pressure while deforming under applied loads. The cohesive forces between the adjoining surfaces may be important. It can be forces of friction or cohesive forces in a glutinous layer between adjoining areas of profiles. In the joints of rallied runs fixed on girders, pasting can essentially prevent local buckling of flat parts of flanges and walls. Such three-layer structure can also help to avoid crushing and shrinkage of metal in the holes for bolts.

40|$|Fan {{noise is}} one of the {{principal}} noise sources generated by a turbofan aero-engine. At supersonic fan speeds, fan tones are generated by the “rotor-alone” pressure field. In general, these tones can be well absorbed by an inlet duct acoustic liner, apart from at high supersonic fan speeds. However, in practice inlet duct liners contain acoustically hard <b>longitudinal</b> <b>splices</b> which cause scattering. This leads to acoustic energy being scattered into a range of different azimuthal mode orders, similar to the modal content resulting from rotor–stator interactions. The effectiveness of an inlet duct lining is reduced because acoustic energy is scattered into modes that are poorly absorbed by the liner. In this article, the effect of this acoustic scattering is examined by three-dimensional finite-element simulations of sound transmission in a turbofan inlet duct. Results include predictions of the sound power transmission loss with different splice widths, and at different supersonic fan speeds. These results demonstrate how acoustic scattering by liner splices can adversely affect fan tone noise levels at low supersonic fan speeds, but have little adverse affect on noise levels at high supersonic fan speeds. The potential noise benefit that could be achieved by manufacturing thinner splices is also examined...|$|R

The specimens are representatives of typical bridge columns between the footing and the point of inflection.

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> steel lap <b>splice</b> {{is always}} {{required}} in reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Normally, in countries having high seismic risk, lap <b>splices</b> of <b>longitudinal</b> steel must be located around mid-height of the storey. However, in regions of low-medium seismic risk, including Hong Kong, lap <b>splices</b> of <b>longitudinal</b> steel begin right above the beam-column interface to facilitate ease of construction. Such splicing method would undesirably cause the column critical region {{to move away}} from the beam-column interface under inelastic deformation. In this paper, the effects of different lap <b>splice</b> locations of <b>longitudinal</b> steel on flexural strength and ductility of RC columns with concrete cube strength around 100 MPa are studied. Four RC column specimens, which contained no lap splice, all lap splices within and outside critical region, as well as lap splices in staggered manner, were tested under simultaneous compressive axial load and reversed cyclic inelastic displacement. It is evident from the results that the column containing lap splices within its critical region had the largest strength but the poorest ductility performance. On the contrary, the column containing lap splices outside its critical region had strength and ductility comparable to those of the column without lap splice. Based on these observations, a recommendation is proposed for positioning <b>longitudinal</b> steel lap <b>splices</b> in RC columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with fatigue were brought into the forefront of research by the explosive decompression and structural failure of the Aloha Airlines Flight 243 in 1988. The structural failure of this airplane {{has been attributed to}} debonding and multiple cracking along the <b>longitudinal</b> lap <b>splice</b> riveted joint in the fuselage. This crash created what may be termed as a minor "Structural Integrity Revolution" in the commercial transport industry. Major steps have been taken by the manufacturers, operators and authorities to improve the structural airworthiness of the aging fleet of airplanes. Notwithstanding, this considerable effort there are still outstanding issues and concerns related to the formulation of Widespread Fatigue Damage which {{is believed to have been}} a contributing factor in the probable cause of the Aloha accident. The lesson from this accident was that Multiple-Site Damage (MSD) in "aging" aircraft can lead to extensive aircraft damage.

40|$|The robust {{performance}} of bridge decks {{is critical to}} ensure smooth daily traffic operations and adequate structural {{performance of}} the bridge during extreme events. Prefabricated bridge decks have become more popular because of their light weight, which is advantageous for long spans and rehabilitation, and rapid construction. Currently, there are no uniform national specifications for the design, performance, or installation of bridge deck systems. This often results {{in the use of}} less durable products because manufacturers design, fabricate, and install components to achieve the lowest initial cost. This has sometimes resulted in poor performance and unreasonably short service lives. Thus, the objectives of this research were to develop standard testing methods to evaluate the performance of critical details for bridge deck systems. ^ Three subassembly deck panels were tested to determine their respective stiffness properties in the strong and weak directions, as well as in torsion. The stiffness properties were used to compute the minimum load applied for strength verification tests of subassembly bridge deck critical details. The critical details tested included <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>splices,</b> and a deck-to-superstructure connection. These details were also tested in cyclic loading and evaluated. Standard testing methods were developed to determine the stiffness in the strong and weak directions, torsional stiffness, verify the strength and evaluate the cyclic loading resistance of <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>splices,</b> and deck-to-superstructure connections. The test methods developed can be used to evaluate the performance of different types of bridge decks in the field. ...|$|R

40|$|The FAA and NASA have {{recently}} completed independent technical {{evaluations of the}} concept of pressure proof testing the fuselage of commercial transport airplanes. The results of these evaluations are summarized. The objectives of the evaluations were to establish the potential benefit of the pressure proof test, to quantify the most desirable proof test pressure, and to quantify the required proof test interval. The focus of the evaluations was on multiple-site cracks extending from adjacent rivet holes of a typical fuselage <b>longitudinal</b> lap <b>splice</b> joint. The FAA and NASA do not support pressure proof testing the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft. The argument against proof testing is as follows: (1) a single proof test does not insure an indefinite life; therefore, the proof test must be repeated at regular intervals; (2) for a proof factor of 1. 33, the required proof test interval must be below 300 flights to account for uncertainties in the evaluation; (3) conducting the proof test at a proof factor of 1. 5 would considerably exceed the fuselage design limit load; therefore, it is not consistent with accepted safe practices; and (4) better safety can be assured by implementing enhanced nondestructive inspection requirements, and adequate reliability can be achieved by an inspection interval several times longer than the proof test interval...|$|R

The behaviour of lapped bars in FRC with a volume content of steel hooked fibres equal to 0. 5 % was investigated. The results show that the post-peak behaviour of FRC can enhance the strength of staggered lapped splices as well as it can reduce their brittleness, thus allowing a reduction of lap length when only a portion of bars at a section are lapped. The results show also the benefits on the durability of concrete members due to the capability of the fibres to markedly reduce the splitting cracks along the splice at service loadings...|$|R
40|$|The presences of subwavelength rigid splices {{are typical}} {{configurations}} in acoustic lined ducts, e. g., in the acoustic treated nacelles of an aeroengine, where the liners are usually manufactured in sections and the sections are jointed together by <b>longitudinal</b> acoustically rigid <b>splices.</b> In general, those small splices just perturb the sound fields and their roles are neglect. But sometimes, e. g., in the intakes of an aeroengine, they may produce important effects. We show numerically that there exist {{a new kind}} of mode in a lined duct in presence of the subwavelength rigid splices. Different from the modes in a uniform lined duct, the new kind of mode is formed by the presences of subwavelength acoustically rigid splices, whose widths are much smaller than the radius of the lined duct and the acoustic wavelength, which trap the surface waves and guide modes of the corresponding uniform lined duct as local oscillations in the vicinities of the small splices.

40|$|According to {{the current}} design practice, {{reinforced}} concrete columns should have sufficient ductility to resist major earthquakes. The ductility allows a column to maintain its strength during inelastic response to earthquakes. The research project reported in this thesis {{involves the use of}} a new retrofit strategy developed for concrete columns at the University of Ottawa. The new procedure consists of external prestressing existing columns with seven wire strands. External prestressing overcomes diagonal tension caused by shear, confines compression concrete, and may improve the behaviour of spliced reinforcement under reversed cyclic loading. Six large scale bridge columns were built and tested under simulated seismic loading. Four long columns with a circular or a square cross-section of approximately 500 mm, and two short circular columns of 610 mm in diameter, were investigated. The columns all had lap <b>spliced</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement within the potential plastic hinge region. The splice length was equal to twenty times the bar diameter. The reinforcing details were typical of the pre- 1970 's design practice. The columns were subjected to a constant axial load of 15 % of their concentric capacity. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} flat-plate {{buildings are}} seismically deficient and {{pose a threat}} to life safety if subjected to ground motions of even low to moderate intensity. Failure in such structures is typically the result of punching failure at the slab-column connection. Because of this, performance-based retrofit procedures are needed to upgrade these non-ductile buildings. This investigation evaluated the use of lightweight pumice stone concrete (LWPSC) infill panels as a retrofit alternative for flat-plate buildings. Six four-tenth-scale slab-column subassemblies were designed and detailed based on ACI 318 - 63 and current performance-based testing requirements. Except for one bare frame specimen, all the subassemblies were retrofitted with prefabricated LWPSC infill panels and subjected to quasi-static loading conforming to FEMA 273. The geometry of the individual units was governed by weight limitations for handling and erection. Among the variables studied were connections between the slabs and the infill wall and the addition of uniformly distributed perforations (circular and rectangular openings). All of the retrofitted specimens had significant increases in both strength and stiffness over that of the bare frame. The behavior of the specimen with the infill panels not attached to the slabs was similar to that of a masonry wall without any connections to the frame. Although diagonal tension cracks formed within the recessed region, ultimate failure of the infill did not occur. Instead, frame-wall interaction transmitted large concentrated shear forces into the column that eventually contributed to failure of the <b>longitudinal</b> tension <b>splice.</b> The remaining subassemblies all had connections to the slabs and perforations within the wall. Specimens with circular holes experienced uniformly distributed cracking throughout the entire area of the infill wall. The chosen configuration, however, did not sufficiently weaken the wall, and shear failure of the column stopped the test. Because of its ductility and energy dissipation mechanism, the most promising infill panel configuration contained rectangular perforations. Two different reinforcement patterns were tested using rectangular openings. The addition of diagonal reinforcement between openings had the effect of increasing the yield strength of the wall as well as better maintaining post-yield deterioration...|$|R

40|$|Most {{design codes}} {{encourage}} the staggering of lapped splices in a section, such that {{a portion of}} the bars in the cross section remains continuous throughout the lap zone. A penalty on lap length may be imposed if all bars are lapped at one section. In the literature, however, almost all tested specimens have had all reinforcement lapped at the same section. This paper presents results of tests carried out to shed some new light on the behaviour of lap splices where only a portion of bars is lapped. To this end, four point bending tests were carried out on 24 full-scale beams with {{all or part of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement lap <b>spliced</b> at mid-span. The beams were reinforced with either 16 or 20 mm diameter rebars, included two grades of concrete and various lap splices configurations, all confined by links. All the beams were designed with the same concrete cover and with the minimum amount of transverse reinforcement permitted by MC 2010, equal to 50 % of the area of the lapped bars. The resistance and the residual strength of the splices were measured and compared with the results of specimens with continuous bars and with all bars lapped. The results show that lapping only a portion of bars at a section impairs splice strength, although some post-peak strength is maintained by the continuous bars. These outcomes raise questions over the validity of EC 2 and ACI 318 - 11 provisions which allow a reduction in lap-length when splices are staggered...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} bridge columns can deteriorate prematurely {{due to the}} alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and/or delayed ettringite formation (DEF), causing internal expansion and cracking {{on the surface of}} the concrete. The performance of the <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement lap <b>splice</b> in deteriorated concrete columns is the focus in this research. This thesis presents the results from the deterioration of large-scale specimens constructed and placed in an environment susceptible to ASR/DEF deterioration, the experimental results from four-point and three-point structural load tests, and an analytical model based on bending theory characterizing the specimen behavior during the structural load tests. Fourteen large-scale specimens were constructed, placed in an environment to accelerate the ASR/DEF deterioration mechanisms, and instrumented both internally and externally to measure the internal concrete expansions, and surface expansions and crack widths. In addition, two control specimens were constructed and kept in a laboratory, preventing ASR/DEF deterioration. Post-tensioning was used to simulate axial load on a bridge column. Structural load tests were performed on eight specimens with no ASR/DEF damage to late stage ASR and minimal DEF damage. Comparing the specimen behaviors during the loading testing, it was found that the yield strength increased about 5 - 15 %, and post-cracking stiffness up to first yielding of the deteriorated specimens was about 25 - 35 % stiffer than the control specimens. The increased specimen strength and stiffness likely occurred from volumetric expansion due to ASR/DEF damage which engaged the reinforcement, further confining the concrete and causing a beneficial increase in the axial post-tensioning load. The analytical model matched the control specimens well and matched the non-control specimens when the axial load was increased...|$|R
40|$|Performance of bridges during {{previous}} earthquakes {{has demonstrated}} that many structural failures {{could be attributed to}} seismic deficiencies in bridge columns. Lack of transverse reinforcement and inadequate <b>splicing</b> of <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement in potential plastic hinge regions of columns constitute primary reasons for their poor performance. A number of column retrofit techniques have been developed and tested in the past. These techniques include steel jacketing, reinforced concrete jacketing and use of transverse prestressing (RetroBelt) for concrete confinement, shear strengthening and splice clamping. A new retrofit technique, involving fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) jacketing has emerged as a convenient and structurally sound alternative with improved durability. The new technique, although received acceptance in the construction industry, needs to be fully developed as a viable seismic retrofit methodology, supported by reliable design and construction procedures. The successful application of externally applied FRP jackets to existing columns, coupled with deteriorating bridge infrastructure, raised the possibility of using FRP reinforcement for new construction. Stay-in-place formwork, in the form of FRP tubes are being researched for its feasibility. The FRP stay-in-place tubes offer ease in construction, convenient formwork, and when left in place, the protection of concrete against environmental effects, including the protection of steel reinforcement against corrosion, while also serving as column transverse reinforcement. Combined experimental and analytical research was conducted in the current project to i) improve the performance of FRP column jacketing for existing bridge columns, and ii) to develop FRP stay-in-place formwork for new bridge columns. The experimental phase consisted of design, construction and testing of 7 full-scale reinforced concrete bridge columns under simulated seismic loading. The columns represented both existing seismically deficient bridge columns, and new columns in stay-in-place formwork. The existing columns were deficient in either shear, or flexure, where the flexural deficiencies stemmed from lack of concrete confinement and/or use of inadequately <b>spliced</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement. The test parameters included cross-sectional shape (circular or square), reinforcement splicing, column shear span for flexure and shear-dominant behaviour, FRP jacket thickness, as well as use of FRP tubes as stay-in-place formwork, with or without internally embedded FRP crossties. The columns were subjected to a constant axial compression and incrementally increasing inelastic deformation reversals. The results, presented and discussed in this thesis, indicate that the FRP retrofit methodology provides significant confinement to circular and square columns, improving column ductility substantially. The FRP jack also improved diagonal tension capacity of columns, changing brittle shear-dominant column behavior to ductile flexure dominant response. The jackets, when the transverse strains are controlled, are able to improve performance of inadequately spliced circular columns, while remain somewhat ineffective in improving the performance of spliced square columns. FRP stay-in-place formwork provides excellent ductility to circular and square columns in new concrete columns, offering tremendous potential for use in practice. The analytical phase of the project demonstrates that the current analytical techniques for column analysis can be used for columns with external FRP reinforcement, provided that appropriate material models are used for confined concrete, FRP composites and reinforcement steel. Plastic analysis for flexure, starting with sectional moment-curvature analysis and continuing into member analysis incorporating the formation of plastic hinging, provide excellent predictions of inelastic force-deformation envelopes of recorded hysteretic behaviour. A displacement based design procedure adapted to FRP jacketed columns, as well as columns in FRP stay-in-place formwork provide a reliable design procedure for both retrofitting existing columns and designing new FRP reinforced concrete columns...|$|R
