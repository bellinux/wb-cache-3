5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E

DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers {{can be used to}} initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule.

40|$|Teaching basic {{microbiology}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>techniques</b> to non-biology majors can be challenging. The {{students take}} the microbiology laboratory {{only because it}} is a requirement for their program and not by personal choice. Recently, we have developed a teaching approach that has shown to increase the interest and involvement of students in learning basic microbiology <b>laboratory</b> <b>techniques.</b> This approach consists of incorporating basic microbiology <b>laboratory</b> <b>techniques</b> in a semester long project that involves isolating an unknown bacterium from their environment {{at the beginning of the}} semester. Students apply basic microbiology techniques learned throughout the course to characterize and identify “their organism”. This approach encourages the inquisitiveness of students and provides relevance to the use of <b>laboratory</b> <b>techniques.</b> </p...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, CR {{cells in}} the {{marginal}} zone {{were found to have}} electrophysiological fingerprints. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies (the <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> in electrophysiology allowing the study of single or multiple ion channels in cells) showed that CRN injected by a suprathreshold depolarizing current pulse express a repetitive firing mode and cells injected by a hyperpolarizing current pulse, express a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (H-current).|$|E
25|$|The patch clamp {{technique}} is a <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> in electrophysiology {{used to study}} ionic currents in individual living cells, tissue sections, or patches of cell membrane. The {{technique is}} especially useful {{in the study of}} excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, muscle fibers, and pancreatic beta cells, and can also be applied to the study of bacterial ion channels in specially prepared giant spheroplasts.|$|E
25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} is {{a common}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> {{that can be used}} both as preparative and analytical method. The principle of electrophoresis relies on the movement of a charged ion in an electric field. In practice, the proteins are denatured in a solution containing a detergent (SDS). In these conditions, the proteins are unfolded and coated with negatively charged detergent molecules. The proteins in SDS-PAGE are separated on the sole basis of their size.|$|E

25|$|All the {{proteins}} from the tissue {{are present in}} the gel, so that individual enzymes must be identified using an assay that links their function to a staining reaction. For example, detection can be based on the localised precipitation of soluble indicator dyes such as tetrazolium salts which become insoluble when they are reduced by cofactors such as NAD or NADP, which generated in zones of enzyme activity. This assay method requires that the enzymes are still functional after separation (native gel electrophoresis), and provides the greatest challenge to using isozymes as a <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) is {{a widely}} employed <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> used to separate different biochemicals {{on the basis of}} their size and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity. Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, high-performance TLC can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).|$|E

Hence, PCR is not widely performed for diagnosis of Lyme disease, but it may {{have a role in}} the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid.|$|E

2500|$|Biotin is {{important}} in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues in these carboxylases. This biotinylation reaction requires ATP and is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. In bacteria, biotin is attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in E. coli). The attachment of biotin to various chemical sites, biotinylation, is used as an important <b>laboratory</b> <b>technique</b> to study various processes, including protein localization, protein interactions, DNA transcription, and replication.
