40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we use {{the gravity}} model of trade to {{decompose}} <b>Latin</b> <b>America’s</b> export growth into components associated with export-supply capacity, import-demand conditions, and other factors. Some have argued that <b>Latin</b> <b>America’s</b> recent sluggish export performance is due to China’s expansion in global markets. Others have cited <b>Latin</b> <b>America’s</b> inability to make needed economic reforms, which have hurt the country’s competitiveness in manufacturing. Our results suggest that negative import-demand shocks associated with both China and the U. S. economy have contributed to the slowdown in <b>Latin</b> <b>America’s</b> export growth...|$|R

Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and <b>Latin</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E
