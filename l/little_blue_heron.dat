2500|$|Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds {{hundreds}} of species of animals including birds, fish, plants, and mammals. [...] The wetlands of Pelican Island {{are a major}} ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity. [...] Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon. [...] Of the endangered species, West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon. [...] Around the lagoon in the refuge are two wood stork refuges. [...] These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population. [...] Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans, great egrets, snowy egrets, reddish egrets, great blue heron, <b>little</b> <b>blue</b> <b>heron,</b> tricolored heron, black-crowned night heron, American white ibis, glossy ibis, double-crested cormorant, anhinga, and American oystercatcher.|$|E

50|$|Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of wildlife species. Though established primarily for waterfowl, the refuge also is a place for {{all or part of the}} year for mammals, songbirds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Many of these animals are difficult to see. Hiding throughout the refuge are creatures great and small such as bobcats, alligators, red and grey fox and wild turkeys. River otter, beaver, raccoon, mink and nutria also make the refuge their home. Other animals that are more frequently seen include white-tailed deer, squirrels, <b>little</b> <b>blue</b> <b>herons,</b> night herons, and barred owls. Many songbirds and wading birds arrive in the spring, and the waters are full of game fish such as channel catfish, largemouth bass and crappie (white perch).|$|R
50|$|Today, woodcock, hairy and downy woodpeckers, and warblers {{inhabit the}} {{extensive}} forest. In the marshes, great <b>blue,</b> green and <b>little</b> <b>blue</b> <b>herons,</b> {{as well as}} common and snowy egrets, hunt for fish. Black ducks, mallards, Canada and snow geese, and other waterfowl use the marshes and open water found {{in and around the}} area. White-tailed deer, gray squirrels, mourning doves, bobwhite quail, and cottontail rabbits are plentiful. Wood ducks are especially attracted to an area of forest deliberately flooded in the fall when the trees are dormant, as are frogs and toads, turtles and snakes. Endangered Delmarva fox squirrels were released on the area and have been thriving there for a decade. Migrating hawks {{can be seen in the}} fall as they travel the Atlantic Flyway.|$|R

50|$|This bird {{is found}} in humid {{tropical}} forests from southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, to Trinidad and Tobago, south to Peru and Argentina. They are able to tolerate some degree of habitat fragmentation, breeding successfully near cities and in forest fragments as small as 200 ha. Despite a slender build and a body weight no greater than a large Buteo hawk, the ornate hawk-eagle is a notably powerful predator which, like other booted eagles, can take prey up to five times its own weight. Birds are the principal prey. Prey items have ranged in size from 180 g to 8 kg when taken. Prey species have included <b>little</b> <b>blue</b> <b>herons,</b> curassows, toucans, wood quail, pigeons, macaws, parrots, cotingas, chickens, and even a black vulture. Mammals are also significant prey, with agoutis, squirrels, rats, procyonids, and monkeys often taken. Reptiles are also occasionally hunted.|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture in North America varies {{geographically}} {{with respect}} to species cultured, annual production, size, complexity, and spatial arrangement of facilities. Species assemblages of predacious birds using aquaculture facilities also vary with many of these industry characteristics. Wading birds are highly adaptable, relatively ubiquitous throughout the aquaculture industry, and often associated with fish depredation problems at aquaculture facilities. Suitability of information regarding the impacts of wading birds to aquaculture varies dramatically by depredating species and industry sector. Great <b>blue</b> <b>herons</b> (Ardea herodias) cause considerable depredation losses on trout aquaculture in the Northeast, and current research suggests that <b>little</b> <b>blue</b> <b>herons</b> (Egretta caerulea) negatively impact baitfish aquaculture. Early research provided similar findings with great <b>blue</b> <b>heron</b> depredations on catfish aquaculture. Recent research however, initiated a paradigm shift in management by demonstrating that some wading birds like the great <b>blue</b> <b>heron</b> and great egret (Casmerodius albus) largely eat diseased catfish and consumption of healthy catfish can be limited by specific management efforts. However, information is lacking on other wading bird species and their impacts to cultured species such as baitfish and crawfish. Issues regarding wading bird depredations are dynamic and evolve with changing demographics of both the aquaculture industry and wading bird populations. Emerging issues include great <b>blue</b> <b>herons</b> as possible vectors for whirling disease in Northeastern trout aquaculture and predation on catfish by wood storks (Mycteria americana). As local, regional, and continental populations of wading birds continue to change in number and geographic distribution, {{it is imperative that}} research identify where and how aquaculture production losses occur and guide science-based management plans to abate production loss. We discuss current population status and trends for selected wading birds and their potential impacts and management on major aquaculture industries in the United States...|$|R

40|$|First, I {{want to say}} {{how much}} I {{appreciate}} observers 2 ̆ 7 responses to my requests for additional details on various sightings, not just rarities, but early and late dates. It 2 ̆ 7 s important to have these details for the archives to help future readers and researchers feel more comfortable with records from our era. Patterns that were apparent included a generally quiet fall for waterfowl (they were all at Lake McConaughy), but excellent numbers of the rarer two scoters (but NO White-winged!) and a surprising 16 Red-necked Grebes. On the other hand, numbers of staging Western Grebes were down significantly, apparently due to poor (dry) summer breeding conditions, but a flock of Brant and a Harlequin Duck added spice. Among herons, there were more Snowy Egrets than Greats in the eastern Rainwater Basin! Snowies and <b>Little</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Herons</b> appeared in good numbers, and the 10 th Glossy Ibis for 2006 (!) made an appearance. A fifth breeding location for Sandhill Crane was reported. Among shorebirds, record numbers of American Golden-Plovers were located, and the recent increase in fall sightings of White-romped Sandpipers continued. These two species, along with Hudsonian Godwit, are usually scarcer in fall than in spring. Also unprecedented historically was a fall flock of 28 migrant Mountain Plovers; previously, records after July were extremely unusual. Other lingering shorebirds included Semipalmated and Piping Plovers, Black-necked Stilt, Willet, and Long-billed Curlew. A count of 5500 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Phalaropes at Crescent Lake NWR was exciting...|$|R
