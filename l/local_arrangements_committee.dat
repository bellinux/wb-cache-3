5000|$|The first {{official}} SEM meeting was September 2-9, 1956, and since then, the Society of Ethnomusicology {{has continued to}} host annual conferences {{throughout the country and}} occasionally abroad. Locations for these large-scale gatherings require a host university with a strong ethnomusicology department, hotels that can house the huge number of attendees ranging, which ranges from 800-1000 people, at an affordable price, and has access to air travel. Locations are typical chosen three years in advance by the SEM Board. The conference is then executed by the Program Committee, <b>Local</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>Committee,</b> and Business Office. [...] The Annual Meetings are made up of programs, paper presentations, lectures, banquets, and special events, which include diverse performances, formal concerts, and dances.

Rick Osborn and John Yates chaired a talented, dedicated conference program committee that provided a meeting with the inspiration, professional development, and networking necessary to our success in continuing education. The speakers and session leaders were carefully selected to illustrate the difference we all make to our communities, our students, and our institution. The conference sessions explored continuing education’s ability to transform lives, communities, and institutions while producing a strong return on investment.

40|$|Poster {{presented}} at the SCC/MLA Annual Meeting in Albuquerque, NM, October 23, 2007. Objection: One of the first steps in hosting an SCC/MLA Annual Meeting is the invitation given by the host group to encourage attendance at the following year’s conference. This poster describes how the Albuquerque hosts created the movie invitation to the 2007 meeting. The goal was to entertain in order to inform potential attendees and advertise Albuquerque. Methods: We brainstormed various possibilities and decided to try something different: a movie. We wanted to employ humor, libraries, and Albuquerque local color. We used free software bundled on our library computers, Windows Movie Maker, and a home digital camcorder. Library faculty reviewed the screenplay. Extras and technical staff were recruited from library staff, family and friends. Sets were contrived {{in various parts of}} the library. Results: The people involved in this endeavor greatly enjoyed the process and the result, Library on the Edge of Forever, was well received at the 2006 Annual Meeting Business Lunch. The <b>Local</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>Committee</b> continues to use the movie theme in planning the conference. Conclusions: Making a short movie for library or conference promotion requires time and it helps to have a few talented people involved.

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the {{individuals}} listed above, I {{would like to thank}} all of those responsible for organizing the 1998 AAPM Annual Meeting. The success of the meeting {{is a result of the}} untiring efforts and voluntary time contributed by many AAPM Members. This is a landmark year for the Annual Meeting for two prominent reasons. For the first time, both the positions of Scientific Program Director and Co-Director are filled by women members of the Association. Drs. Mary Martel and Maryellen Giger have worked diligently to develop an outstanding scientific program for this year’s meeting. Secondly, a long range goal of the Program Committee was brought to fruition with the implementation of an electronic abstract submission process. With the help of Mary Martel, Bruce Curran, and Headquarters staff, a database system was developed that allowed the receipt, reviewing, and assigning of all abstracts via the Internet. Authors were also notified electronically regarding the acceptance of their abstract submissions. Barring the usual glitches of any new process, it has been an overwhelming success and I want to thank everyone involved for making this goal a reality. Finally, I would like to recognize the Abstract Reviewers, the members of the <b>Local</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>Committee,</b> and the Invited Speakers, Symposia Moderators, and Session Chairpersons.

40|$|The Seventh International Symposium on Gaseous Dielectrics {{was held}} in Knoxville, Tennessee, U. S. A., on April 24 - 28, 1994. The {{symposium}} continued the interdisciplinary character and comprehensive approach of the preceding six symposia. Gaseous DielecIries VII is a detailed record of the symposium proceedings. It covers recent advances and developments {{in a wide range}} of basic, applied and industrial areas of gaseous dielectrics. It is hoped that Gaseous DielecIries VII will aid future research and development in, and encourage wider industrial use of, gaseous dielectrics. The Organizing Committee of the Seventh International Symposium on Gaseous Dielectrics consisted of G. Addis (U. S. A.), L. G. Christophorou (U. S. A.), F. Y. Chu (Canada), A. H. Cookson (U. S.

40|$|Dear {{colleagues in}} history, {{welcome to the}} one-hundred-fi rst {{annual meeting of the}} Organiza-tion of American Historians in New York. Last year we met in our {{founding}} site of Minneap-olis-St. Paul, before that in the national capital of Washington, DC. On the present occasion we meet in the world’s media capital, but in a very special way: this is a bridge-and-tunnel aff air, not limited to just the island of Manhattan. Bridges and tunnels connect the island to the larger metropolitan region. For a long time, the people in Manhattan looked down on people from New Jersey and the “outer boroughs” — Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island—who came to the island via those bridges and tunnels. Bridge-and-tunnel people were supposed to lack the sophistication and style of Manhattan people. Bridge-and-tunnel people also did the work: hard work, essential work, beautifully creative work. You will see this work in sessions and tours extending beyond midtown Manhattan. Be sure not to miss, for example, “From Mambo to Hip-Hop: Th e South Bronx Latin Music Tour ” and the bus tour to my own city of Newark, New Jersey. Not that this meeting is bridge-and-tunnel only. Th anks to the excellent, hard working program committee, chaired by Debo-rah Gray White, and the <b>local</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>committee,</b> chaired by Mark Naison and Irma Watkins-Owens, you can chose from an abundance of off erings in and on historic Manhattan: in Harlem, the Cooper Union, Chinatown, the Center for Jewish History, the Brooklyn Historical Society, the New-York Historical Society, the American Folk Art Museum, and many other sites of great interest...|$|E
40|$|The 27 th Symposium of the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) Study Group on Ethnochoreology {{took place}} at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Ireland, from 22 nd – 29 th July, 2012. The University, {{situated}} on the River Shannon in the mid-west of Ireland, provided a beautiful location for the Symposium. The year, 2012, marked a fiftieth-year celebration of the Study Group that evolved within the earlier International Folk Music Council (IFMC). Hosting this Symposium was, therefore, of special significance to the University of Limerick particularly since the first Master of Arts degree in Ethnochoreology, at any university in Europe, was established at the University of Limerick in 1996. The success of this event was due to the assistance and support of many people and institutions. Micheál Ó Súilleabháin (Director), Sandra Joyce (Acting Director), and faculty and staff of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, facilitated and supported this biennial meeting of the Symposium. The Arts Council of Ireland, the European Cultural Contact Point, Fáilte Ireland, and the University of Limerick Foundation all provided financial assistance. The National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, Dance Research Forum Ireland, and ICTM Ireland also provided support. The many talented students at the Irish World Academy, including alumni of the postgraduate programmes in Ethnochoreology and Irish Traditional Dance Performance contributed {{to the success of the}} meeting by performing at the Opening Reception and at the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Like all important events, rigorous organisation in programming combined with social interaction and networking was pivotal. The Local Arrangements Committee: Catherine Foley (Chair), Colin Quigley, Mats Melin, and Orfhlaith Ni Bhriain coordinated their efforts to make the Symposium run in a smooth and professional manner. The Programme Committee: Colin Quigley (Chair), Hanafi Bin Hussin, Mehmet Öcal Özbilgin, Daniela Stavelová, and Judy van Zile, skillfuly arranged a programme schedule. The board of the ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology, in particular Laszló Felfoldi (Chair) and Anne von Bibra Wharton (Secretary), also provided much support and assistance. Presenters at the Symposium came from far and near including Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. They presented on two themes. Theme 1 : Dance and Place; and Theme 2 : Dance and Festival. Thirty-eight individual presenters and one roundtable presented on Theme 1, while eighteen individual presenters presented on Theme 2. Throughout the week, various Study Group meetings took place. In addition, recent scholarly publications of individuals of the Study Group together with DVD compilations of previous Study Group symposia were made available for purchase. The Organising Committee included a number of social and cultural events throughout the week. On Monday evening, 23 rd July, it hosted a Céilí dance workshop. This was in preparation for the barbecue Céilí on Saturday evening, 28 th July. A film evening was also introduced during the Symposium. On Tuesday evening, 24 th July, the film evening took place in Theatre 1 of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance. The Pearse Moore Oscar Academy Award nominated film, Dance Lexie Dance (1996) was shown as well as the 2 ̆ 7 Master Class 2 ̆ 7 documentary programme from the televised Rising Steps series, produced by Stirling Productions. These were based on Irish dance. Three short UNESCO films followed on Flamenco, Slovatsco, and the Mevlevi Ceremony. On Wednesday afternoon, participants went on an excursion to the village of Killaloe in County Clare. Here they had the opportunity to explore the village and go on a short boat cruise on Lough Derg. On board, members of the <b>Local</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>Committee</b> entertained with some Irish traditional music and dance and Symposium participants also shared music, song and dance from their cultures. This was followed by dinner in Flanagan 2 ̆ 7 s Restaurant on the banks of Lough Derg. After the Study Group 2 ̆ 7 s Business Meeting on Thursday afternoon, 26 th July, the participants had the opportunity to visit the National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, University of Limerick. This was followed by the Pioneers 2 ̆ 7 Dinner and the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Students, alumni, and faculty of the Irish World Academy performed at this concert. It included traditional Irish dance and music performances and new choreographed Irish theatrical solos and ensemble works. On the final day, participants went on an optional excursion to the Burren in County Clare. They also visited the village of Doolin, the Cliffs of Moher, and finished with dinner in Bunratty Castle where they were entertained by local traditional musicians and dancers. All participants of the Symposium contributed to a stimulating, enjoyable, and a culturally enriching experience. This publication is a record of the entire event and the scholarly presentations at the Symposium. Abstracts are included for those scholars who did not submit their papers. A number of the texts are written by scholars whose first language is not English. To unify the style of the volume, the editors, Elsie Ivancich Dunin and Catherine Foley, standardised the language use and the reference style format of all papers. They endeavoured to retain the voices of the authors. Also, when representing the voices of field consultants in papers some scholars chose to use italics while others did not. The editors permitted both. The Dunin and deAlaiza 2 ̆ 7 s DdA reference format for dance as an internationally friendly style format was applied, and British English spelling was used throughout. The publication of papers from the 27 th Symposium of the Study Group on Ethnochoreology would not have been possible without the financial support of the European Cultural Contact Point and institutional support of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, and the University of Limerick...|$|E
