He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a <b>locomotive</b> <b>engine</b> driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>engine</b> is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen (AFULE) {{represented}} locomotive {{drivers and}} crew in Australia from the 1920s. Locomotive enginemen originally organized alongside firemen as craft unions, {{with the first}} in Australia being the Victorian <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Engine</b> Drivers’ Association formed in 1861. The idea of a federated national body for enginemen was first proposed at a Victorian Conference of locomotive associations in 1886, which eventually occurred {{at the turn of}} the century with the formation of the Federated Locomotive Enginemen’s Association of Australasia. This was renamed the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen in 1920. The Victorian <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Engine</b> Drivers’ Association opted not to ballot its members on whether to amalgamate into the industry-wide VRU in 1911. The Association and later Victorian AFULE therefore remained a separate union from the ARU in Victoria for most of the 20th century. In 1993 the AFULE in Victoria and all other states and territories except Queensland voted to amalgamate into the PTU.|$|E

The running speed at which the automatic brake comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|E

25|$|On March 8, 2010, Norfolk Southern Railway Company {{agreed to}} pay $4 million penalty to resolve alleged {{violations}} of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and hazardous materials laws for a 2005 chlorine spill in Graniteville, S.C. Under the settlement filed {{in federal court in}} Columbia, S.C., Norfolk Southern will be required to pay a civil penalty of $3,967,500 for the alleged CWA violations, to be deposited in the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The alleged CWA violations, included in an amended complaint filed in March 2009, are for the discharge of tons of chlorine, a hazardous substance, from a derailed train tank car and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured <b>locomotive</b> <b>engine</b> fuel tanks. For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting. Further, the settlement includes a supplemental environmental project (SEP) valued at $100,000 to plant vegetation along the banks of Horse Creek to decrease erosion and sedimentation, thereby improving water quality in Horse Creek.|$|E
