Further {{finishing}} may include thin leather or waterproof bark, to protect the bow from moisture, and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and gold leaf.|$|E
5|$|The Qum-Darya bow was {{superseded}} in {{the modern}} area of Hungary by an 'Avar' type, with more and differently-shaped <b>laths.</b> The grip <b>laths</b> stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued {{to the back of}} the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces. The belly lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah <b>laths</b> became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional <b>laths</b> were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 <b>laths</b> on an asymmetrical bow with stiff, set back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120–140cm. When unstrung the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50-60 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Later {{developments}} in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splice to the wooden core of the bow, rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening <b>laths.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of stucco accessories, such as weep screeds, control and {{expansion}} joints, corner-aids and architectural reveals are sometimes also incorporated into the <b>lath.</b> Wire <b>lath</b> is used to give the plaster something to attach to and to add strength. Types include expanded-metal <b>lath,</b> woven-wire <b>lath,</b> and welded-wire <b>lath.</b>|$|R
50|$|Counter-lath is a {{term used}} in roofing and {{plastering}} {{for a piece of}} wood placed perpendicular to the <b>lath.</b> In roofing, a counter-lath is a slight piece of timber parallel with and between common rafters to give the <b>lath</b> extra support or a <b>lath</b> placed by eye between every two gauged ones. In plastering, a counter-lath is placed perpendicular to the <b>lath</b> as a fillet (a thin, narrow strip of material) to space the <b>lath</b> off of the surface to allow the plaster to pass through the <b>lath</b> and key (mechanically bond) to the <b>lath.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>lath</b> or slat is a thin, {{narrow strip}} of straight-grained wood used under roof {{shingles}} or tiles, on <b>lath</b> and plaster walls and ceilings to hold plaster, and in lattice and trellis work. <b>Lath</b> has expanded to mean any type of backing material for plaster including a metal wire mesh or expanded metal that is applied to a wood or metal framework as matrix over which stucco or plaster is applied and wallboard products called gypsum or rock <b>lath.</b> Also reed mat was historically a <b>lath</b> material. One of the key elements of <b>lath,</b> whether wooden slats or wire mesh, are the openings or gaps that allow plaster or stucco to ooze behind and form a mechanical bond to the <b>lath</b> where gypsum <b>lath</b> relies more on a chemical bond.|$|R
5|$|The first {{surviving}} {{treatise on}} composite bow construction and archery {{was written in}} Arabic under Mamluk rule about 1368. Fragments of bone <b>laths</b> from composite bows were found among grave goods in the United Arab Emirates dating from the period between 100BC-150AD.|$|E

5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo <b>laths</b> forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E

500|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Huns, this {{tradition}} of bows with stiffened grips arrived in Europe. [...] "Alanic graves in the Volga region dating to the 3rd to 4th century CE signal the adoption of the Qum-Darya type by Sarmatian peoples from Hunnic groups advancing from the East. In general, Hunnic/Qum-Darya bows had two pairs of ear <b>laths</b> identical in every respect to those found on Roman limes sites. The ear <b>laths</b> show only a greater proportion of longer <b>laths</b> (like those of Roman examples from Bar Hill and London). More distinctively, the grip of the bow was stiffened by three <b>laths.</b> On the sides were glued a pair of trapezoidal <b>laths</b> with their longest edges towards the back. On the belly was glued a third lath, varying in shape but often narrow with parallel sides and splayed ends. Therefore, each bow possessed seven grip and ear <b>laths,</b> compared with none on the Scythian and Sarmatian bows and four (ear) <b>laths</b> on the Yrzi bow." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bolton {{arm of the}} Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal was one of Dibnah's regular haunts. The canal was by then largely disused (the Bolton arm {{had been}} mostly closed in 1924) and Dibnah {{sometimes}} dredged it with an iron hook on a rope, {{for what he called}} 'plunder'. [...] Much of this was stored in the back yard of his mother's house. Dibnah and his friend Alan Heap built a canoe from old bicycle wheels (cut in half to make the ribs), slate <b>laths</b> and a canvas sheet from the back of a lorry. Much to the consternation of his mother, Dibnah sailed the boat along the nearby River Croal. [...] He once astonished his teachers when, following the theft of the school keys, he cut new keys for each classroom door.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum <b>lath</b> (rock <b>lath)</b> {{consists}} of gypsum plaster sandwiched between two sheets of absorbent paper, the finish side treated with gypsum crystals for the plaster to chemically bond to and sometimes perforated to allow mechanical bonding. It was improved in 1910 by the paper wrapping {{the edges and}} multiple variations were developed in the 1930s. Gypsum <b>lath</b> is commonly used in place of wood since it is noncombustible, easy to use, and gives better results. The popularity of the <b>lath</b> and plaster method declined in the 1950s, as it {{was replaced by the}} less expensive drywall method.

500|$|The current Bristol County Jail was {{constructed}} in 1828 to replace a previous jail erected on the same site in 1792. The new structure was a [...] by [...] -story stone structure topped with a gable roof. According to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society the stone came from the ballast of Bristol ships. Material from the original jail {{was used in the}} new structure, including the clapboards which were split and reused as <b>laths.</b> The new jail and {{was constructed}} for a cost of $3,900. The front facade is five bays wide and faces north on Court Street. The facade originally featured a recessed Greek Revival entrance that was replaced with a newer door and extended by a Victorian hood. At the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1973, all the windows except one on the second story were changed from the twelve-over-eight and twelve-over twelve sashes to the two-over-two Victorian sash. In 1959, the Bristol Historical Society removed the internal east chimney on the first floor as part of renovations.|$|E
500|$|From {{about the}} 4th century BCE, {{the use of}} {{stiffened}} ends on composite bows became widespread. The stiffened end of the bow is a [...] "siyah" [...] (Arabic, Persian), [...] "szarv" [...] (Hungarian), [...] "sarvi" [...] (Finnish; both 'sarvi' and 'szarv' mean 'horn') or [...] "kasan" [...] (Turkish); the bending section is a [...] "dustar" [...] (Arabic), [...] "lapa" [...] (Finnish) or [...] "sal" [...] (Turkish). For centuries, the stiffening was accomplished by attaching <b>laths</b> of bone or antler {{to the sides of}} the bow at its ends. The bone or antler strips are more likely to survive burial {{than the rest of the}} bow. The first bone strips suitable for this purpose come from [...] "graves of the fourth or third centuries" [...] BCE. These stiffeners are found associated with nomads of the time. Maenchen-Helfen states that they are not found in Achaemenid Persia, nor in early Imperial Rome, nor in Han China. However Coulston attributes Roman stiffeners to about or before 9 CE. He identifies a Steppe Tradition of Scythian bows with working tips, which lasted, in Europe, until the arrival of the Huns, and a Near East or Levantine tradition with siyahs, possibly introduced by the Parni as siyahs are found in Sassanid but not Achaemenid contexts. Siyahs have also been described from the Arabian peninsula. Composite bows were adopted by the Roman Empire and were made even in the cold and damp of Britannia. They were the normal weapon of later Roman archers, both infantry and cavalry units (although Vegetius recommends training recruits [...] "arcubus ligneis", with wooden bows).|$|E

As the Cumans became more settled, they constructed forts for defence and settlement purposes. The Cuman-Kipchaks used dung for fires when firewood was not available. The Cumans had very strict rules (taboos) against theft, and thus would, without prohibition, loosen their horses, camels, and livestock (sheep, oxen) without shepherds or guards when they were stationary. The law of blood vengeance was common among the Cumans-Kipchaks.|$|E
2500|$|Frame {{structures}} were built on piers {{to keep the}} air circulating across the area's damp soil, while brick structures had a root cellar with a drainage tunnel.

[...] "Dutch biscuits" [...] (wood <b>laths</b> wrapped in straw and mud) provided insulation and soundproofing between the ceiling and floors. The exterior was insulated with bricks between the exterior's unpainted weatherboards and the interior's lath and plaster walls. Structures had standard parts and pre-cut, pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints. Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{ten percent}} of the houses in Boundary Street had {{subterranean}} corridors in 1883, which the local medical officer {{regarded as one of the}} most alarming architectural phenomena of the Old Nichol housing stock. The only way to reach the back yard, in which the dustbins and the lavatory was located, was by descending rickety steps, passing through an unlit, unpaved cellar passageway just five feet high, with the yard at the other side.

XXI, no. 1082) published an article [...] "More Revelations of Bethnal Green", describing the underground rooms of the Old Nichol: [...] "The occupation of the underground rooms here, as well as elsewhere, is illegal, and may at once be prevented. Under the Local Management Act, as our readers may remember, an underground room may not be occupied separately as a dwelling unless certain conditions are complied with, one of which is that there shall be a window of specified size, with an area before it open down to 6 inches below the floor of the room... One of the worst examples that we saw of these underground rooms we must endeavour to illustrate. It is in Nichol-street, No.59, and may be described as entirely below the surface. the window of the apartment is a little over 3 feet in width, and about the same in height; the area is even with the breadth and depth of the window. It extends from the wall about 2 feet, and was closed with an iron grating; but this having become broken, the entire top of the area has been covered with wood, so that the only means of light and ventilation is a chink 3 feet wide by 4 and a half inches in height. Passing through the passage to the back, the dilapidated condition of the premises, as may be seen in the sketch, is startling. The plaster has fallen from the walls and the ceilings, the narrow staircase is rotten and shaky, the general colour is of a dingy smoky black, with peeps of indifferent brickwork and broken <b>laths.</b> At the back there is a large open space, in a most filthy condition; damp refuse of all kinds is piled up against the wall; there is no supply of water;" ...|$|E
