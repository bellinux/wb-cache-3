40|$|Fuzzy class <b>label</b> <b>adjustment</b> is a {{classification}} preprocessing strategy that compensates for the possible imprecision of class labels. Using training vectors, robust measures of location and dispersion are computed for each class center. Based on distances from these centers, fuzzy sets are constructed that determine {{the degree to}} which each input vector belongs to each class. These membership values are then used to adjust class labels for the training vectors. This strategy is evaluated using a multilayer perceptron and two different robust location measures for the discrimination of meteorological storm events and is shown to improve the performance of the underlying classifier...|$|E

40|$|Users {{of social}} {{networking}} {{services such as}} Facebook often want to manage the sharing of information and content with diﬀerent groups of people based on their diﬀering relationships. The growing popularity of such services has meant that users are increasingly faced with the copresence of diﬀerent groups associated with diﬀerent aspects of their lives, within their network of contacts. However, few users are utilising the group-based privacy controls provided {{to them by the}} SNS provider. In this thesis we examine the reasons behind the lack of use of group-based privacy controls, ﬁnding that it can be largely attributed to the signiﬁcant burden associated with group conﬁguration. We aim to overcome this burden by developing automated mechanisms to assist users with many aspects of group-based privacy control, including initial group conﬁguration, <b>labeling,</b> <b>adjustment</b> and selection of groups for sharing privacy sensitive content. We use a mixed methods approach in order to understand: how automated mechanisms should be designed in order to support users with their privacy control, how well these mechanisms can be expected to work, what the limitations are, and how such mechanisms aﬀect users’ experiences with social networking services and content sharing. Our results reveal the criteria that SNS users employ in order to conﬁgure their groups for privacy control and illustrate that oﬀ-the-shelf algorithms and techniques which are analogous to these criteria can be used to support users. We show that structural network clustering algorithms provide beneﬁts for initial group conﬁguration and that clustering threshold adjustments and detection of hubs and outliers with the network are necessary for group adjustment. We demonstrate that public proﬁle data can be extracted from the network in order to help users to comprehend their groups, and that contextual information relating to context, contacts, and content {{can be used to make}} recommendations about which groups might be useful for disclosure in a given situation. We also show that all of these mechanisms can be used to signiﬁcantly reduce the burden of privacy control and that users react positively to such features...|$|R

40|$|In specifying third {{generation}} models of factor demands, adjustment costs are frequently {{treated as a}} function of net rather than gross investment. Such specifications assume replacement investment is frictionless and in equilibrium adjustment costs are zero. Recognition that adjustment costs may reflect not only net but also gross investment leads to a more complex model. But the revised model implies increasing long-run average costs. Such a model can still be specified to impose constant long-run average costs, or constant returns to scale. The latter condition is often desirable to avoid confusion in estimating technological progress. However, empirical work suggests that conventionally <b>labelled</b> expressions of <b>adjustment</b> costs embrace other influences. Proper measurement and identification of such costs may well require more finely tuned approaches. ...|$|R

5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its <b>label</b> have undergone <b>adjustments</b> over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to two distinct but convergent issues: the possibility of paraphrase and an account of context sensitivity {{on the basis of}} textual cohesion (or coherence). The possibility of explaining contextual specifications of meaning as a side effect of establishing textual cohesion is explored through an investigation into the nature of texts. Taking off from existing theories of text structure, an ideal concept of cohesion is elaborated which accounts for textual connection by the interpreter’s assignment of rhetorical relations (or discourse relations). In addition to connecting the elements of a text together, rhetorical relations have implications for the content of terms and sentences composing a text. The contextual meaning of terms and sentences are thus {{explained by the fact that}} the terms and sentences are parts of a text. Enriching the domain of context sensitivity, special emphasis is placed on the implications of rhetorical relations for predicate terms. Through an analysis of authentic literary examples, a certain conception of predicate reference is vindicated which is <b>labelled</b> rhetorical <b>adjustment.</b> The approach contrasts with several contextualist theories in linguistics and philosophy of language which prefer to account for the generation of meaning transcending the linguistic meaning of terms and sentences as specified by syntax and lexicon by means of external parameters such as the speaker’s intentions and communicative aims. In this way the thesis is a contribution to the debate concerning the interface between semantics and pragmatics. Such a contextualism based on the notion of cohesion has implications for a certain conception of paraphrase. It is often emphasized that it is not possible to say the same thing in different words. It is argued that taking contextualism and cohesion into account justifies a conception of paraphrase according to which it is not opposed to, but contributes to the constitution of the original meaning. Such a paraphrase is undemanding in that it does not aim to capture all the aspects of the original wording, yet it is neither trivial, since it is unpredictable from a lexical point of view nor irrelevant, since it is a constitutive feature of the original expression in so far as it is part of a text...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from adolescence into young adulthood can present many new challenges. How well {{and to what}} degree {{students are able to}} effectively meet the demands and challenges of college has been <b>labeled</b> as <b>adjustment</b> (Mattanah, Hancock, & Brand, 2004). There is a growing interest and need for effective strategies and programs that can assist students in the transition to college. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify how participation in physical activity, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form may assist or hinder in students’ academic, social, personal-emotional adjustment and institutional attachment to college life, as measured by the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ). There were two groups of 1 st and 2 nd year undergraduate students: 1) physically active students (n = 151) who were enrolled in a Physical Education Non-Professionals (PENP) physical activity courses that met three times per week and 2) non-physically active students (n = 137) who were not currently and had not previously enrolled in a PENP course. There were 288 participants within the study. Quantitative survey research methods examined a) academic adjustment, b) social adjustment, c) personal-emotional adjustment, d) institutional attachment and e) daily physical activity levels. Descriptive statistics provided information about the overall characteristics of the sample. Research question 1 through 5 were tested using multiple one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Statistically significant results, p =. 000, were found between physically active and non-physically active students’ Academic, p =. 029, and Social, p =. 000 adjustment scores. Cohen’s d identified a large effect size for both the Social, d =. 711, and Personal-Emotional, d =. 870, adjustment domains. Cronbach’s alpha reported an acceptable level (α =. 760) of internal consistency for the SACQ and a low level (α =. 562) of internal consistency for the IPAQ. Students within the non-physically active group displayed higher levels of social adjustment and institutional attachment. Students within the physically-active group displayed higher levels of academic and personal-emotional adjustment. Results found that students who demonstrate higher levels of institutional attachment to the university they attend seem to adjust better academically, socially and personal-emotionally.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: Bone-destructive disease {{treatments}} include bisphosphonates and antibodies against RANKL (aRANKL). Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a side effect. Etiopathology models {{failed to}} explain their restriction to the jaw. The osteoproliferative transcription factor Msx- 1 is expressed constitutively only in mature jaw bone. Msx- 1 expression might be impaired in bisphosphonate-related ONJ. This study compared the expression of Msx- 1, BMP- 2 and RANKL, in ONJ-affected and healthy jaw bone. Material and Methods: An automated immunohistochemistry based alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase method was used on ONJ-affected and healthy jaw bone samples (n= 20 each) : cell-number ratio (<b>labelling</b> index, Bonferroni <b>adjustment).</b> Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantitatively compare Msx- 1, BMP- 2, RANKL, and GAPDH mRNA levels. Results: Labeling indices were significantly lower for Msx- 1 (p< 0. 03) and RANKL (p< 0. 003), and significantly higher (p< 0. 02) for BMP- 2 in ONJ compared to healthy bone. Expression was 7 -fold lower (p< 0. 03) for Msx- 1, 22 -fold lower (p< 0. 001) for RANKL, and 8 -fold higher (p< 0. 02) for BMP- 2 in ONJ bone. Conclusions: Msx- 1, RANKL suppression and BMP- 2 induction {{were consistent with the}} bisphosphonate-associated osteopetrosis and impaired bone remodelling in BP- and aRANKL-induced ONJ.

40|$|Abstract Background Bone-destructive disease {{treatments}} include bisphosphonates and antibodies {{against the}} osteoclast differentiator, RANKL (aRANKL); however, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) {{is a frequent}} side-effect. Current models fail to explain the restriction of bisphosphonate (BP) -related and denosumab (anti-RANKL antibody) -related ONJ to jaws. Msx- 1 is exclusively expressed in craniofacial structures and pivotal to cranial neural crest (CNC) -derived periodontal tissue remodeling. We hypothesised that Msx- 1 expression might be impaired in bisphosphonate-related ONJ. The study aim was to elucidate Msx- 1 and RANKL-associated signal transduction (BMP- 2 / 4, RANKL) in ONJ-altered and healthy periodontal tissue. Methods Twenty ONJ and twenty non-BP exposed periodontal samples were processed for RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.

RANKL suppression substantiated the clinical finding of impaired bone remodelling in BP- and aRANKL-induced ONJ-affected bone structures. Msx- 1 suppression in ONJ-adjacent periodontal tissue suggested a bisphosphonate-related impairment in cellular differentiation that occurred exclusively jaw remodelling.

Stratified analyses in subgroups including patients with STEMI yielded a similar safety profile. After adjusting for baseline variables, no relevant differences in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were observed at 1  year (prasugrel/clopidogrel: cardiac death 2. 6 %/ 4. 2 %, myocardial infarction 2. 7 %/ 3. 8 %, revascularisation 5. 9 %/ 6. 7 %, stroke 1. 0 %/ 1. 6 %). Of note, this study was not designed to compare efficacy between prasugrel and clopidogrel. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective ACS cohort, patients treated with prasugrel according to current guidelines (ie, in patients without cerebrovascular disease, old age or underweight) had a similar safety profile compared with patients treated with clopidogrel.

40|$|A Decision Management System (DMS) {{provides}} {{means to}} model and automate enterprise decisions {{and they are}} applied {{in a wide range}} of industries, among which health care, commerce, insurance, finance and transportation. These systems make millions of decisions each day without direct human supervision, impacting the life of millions of people and impacting economies at a large scale. The multiplicative effect of decision automation provides the opportunity to fine-tune the decision system. By analyzing its global and emerging properties rather than focusing on the details of each decision, the system as a whole can be better adapted to the reality it models. Like expert systems, DMSs provide a clear separation of decision logic, information related to individual decisions and decision execution. These data spaces contain a wealth of information related to the structure and functioning of a DMS. In this thesis various ways are explored to visualize and analyze this data in order to help a business user to gain a deeper understanding of automated decisions. To address the problem of understanding the global and emerging properties of automated decision making systems, we combine interactive analysis of the decision data with analysis of the decision logic. We present a visual analytics system, the Decision Exploration Lab (DEL), which provides a verbal analysis mode and a visual decision exploration mode. In verbal mode the user can make selections on past decisions using controlled natural language. In visual de- cision exploration mode, the decision data is analyzed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). The analysis results are visualized using interactive techniques to show the important structure of the decision data to the user. Correlated concepts can be clustered at a level of granularity that suits the needs of the business analyst. Clustered concepts can next be linked to the rules of the decision logic that are relevant for the subset of decisions which match these concepts. We evaluated our approach with two use case scenarios from the car insurance industry. Apart from the above, we propose a number of technical contributions, enhancements and extensions to information visualization methods, for multivariate categorical data. Firstly, we present a generic algorithm to generate all well-known treemap layouts as well as other rectangular space-filling layouts. Secondly, we present explanatory and interactive visualization techniques to support interpretation and usage of MCA. Thirdly, we present <b>labeling</b> and scale <b>adjustment</b> techniques in order to improve the usability of 2 D-plots...|$|R
40|$|Analyzing scanner {{price data}} that cover 27 product {{categories}} over an eight-year period {{from a large}} Mid-western supermarket chain, we uncover a surprising regularity in the data—small price increases occur more frequently than small price decreases. We find that this asymmetry holds for price changes of up to about 10 cents, on average. The asymmetry disappears for larger price changes. We document this finding for the entire data set, {{as well as for}} individual product categories. Further, we find that the asymmetry holds even after excluding from the data the observations pertaining to inflationary periods, and after allowing for various lengths of lagged price adjustment. The findings are insensitive also to the measure of price level used to measure inflation (the PPI or the CPI). To explain these findings, we extend the implications of the literature on rational inattention to individual price dynamics. Specifically, we argue that processing and reacting to price change information is a costly activity. An important implication of rational inattention is that consumers may rationally choose to ignore—and thus not to respond to—small price changes, creating a "range of inattention" along the demand curve. This range of consumer inattention, we argue, gives the retailers incentive for asymmetric price adjustment "in the small. " These incentives, however, disappear for large price changes, because large price changes are processed by consumers and therefore trigger their response. Thus, no asymmetry is observed "in the large. " An additional implication of rational inattention is that the extent of the asymmetry found "in the small " might vary over the business cycle: it might diminish during recessions and strengthen during expansions. We find that the data are indeed consistent with these predictions. An added contribution of the paper is that our theory may offer a possible explanation for the presence of small price changes, which has been a long-standing puzzle in the literature. chain, we find significantly higher retail price rigidity for private label products than for nationally branded products during the Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday periods relative {{to the rest of the}} year. The finding cannot be explained by changes in holiday period promotional practices because we find that private label promotions appear to diminish at least as much as national brands. The increased rigidity of private label products relative to national brands is only partially accounted for by increased rigidity of wholesale prices. After ruling out other potential explanations, we suggest that the higher private label price rigidity might be due to the increased emphasis on social consumption during holiday periods, raising the customers’ value of nationally branded products relative to the private <b>labels.</b> Asymmetric Price <b>Adjustment,</b> Rational Inattention, Cost and Benefit of Information Acquiring and Processing, Price Rigidity...|$|R
