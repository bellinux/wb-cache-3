500|$|Several reviewers praised Ready at Dawn's {{solution}} for the controls and gameplay. Because the PlayStation 2 (PS2) controller has two analog sticks and the PSP only has one, GamePro stated [...] "the lack of a second analog stick could have been problematic but it's not." [...] Modojo.com similarly stated that {{despite the lack of}} a second analog stick, [...] "Kratos handles superbly on the PSP" [...] and that the weapon and magic attacks are [...] "mapped out perfectly around the PSP's control set-up." [...] IGN's Chris Roper even claimed the control scheme [...] "works better than on the PS2." [...] Roper further claimed that Ready at Dawn [...] "has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact," [...] stating that [...] "combat is extremely responsive." [...] Matt Leone of 1UP similarly praised developers {{solution for}} the control scheme as well as the game's [...] "fantastic" [...] pacing. However, GamePro criticized the relative lack of variety in enemies. The puzzles were criticized, and G4 claimed that some [...] "are so maddeningly difficult to solve", while GameSpot's Aaron Thomas noted the lack of puzzles, claiming that it [...] "could have used more". GamePro also criticized the fact that [...] "You still have to <b>lug</b> <b>boxes</b> around to solve environmental puzzles". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer also criticized Ready at Dawn for cutting some puzzles, as well as cutting co-op play, multiplayer, dialogue, and characters.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] grain chinch bug (GCB) M. diplopterus is endemic to the Western Cape and as such is classified as a quarantine pest. The aim of this project was to evaluate post-harvest methods of control to ensure that packed fruit cartons destined for export are free of live GCB adults and acceptable to international quarantine standards. Cold storage trials were carried out at a commercial cold store in Ceres during three years. GCB adults were subjected to controlled atmosphere conditions (treatment) and regular atmosphere conditions (control) {{for a period of}} 6 weeks during 2001 and 10 weeks during 2002. The trials during 2001 and 2002 were carried out by packing GCB and pears into cardboard boxes with plastic liners. During 2003 the trial was repeated, but GCB and pears were placed directly into open plastic <b>lug</b> <b>boxes</b> without plastic liners. The results showed that GCB appear to be very well cold-adapted and that at least nine weeks will be required to achieve 100 % mortality under controlled atmosphere conditions if pears are packed with plastic liners. A mortality of 100 % was never achieved under regular atmosphere conditions {{for the duration of the}} trial. If no plastic liners were used, 100 % mortality of GCB occurred one week earlier under controlled atmosphere conditions. Sufficient data was generated here to conclude that low temperature in itself was not sufficient to effectively sterilize pears from GCB infestations. The time required to achieve 100 % mortality under controlled atmosphere conditions would probably compromise fruit quality or be unacceptably long...|$|E

50|$|One or two cast or pressed metal rims attach by {{threaded}} tension rods or <b>lugs</b> to nut <b>boxes</b> bolted {{onto the}} shell {{and hold the}} heads onto the bearing edges of the shell. The tension rod assembly needs to be precision-machined, cast and fitted to enable predictable and secure tuning without inhibiting resonance or introducing extra vibration. All components will be placed under great tension and experience added stresses from playing.|$|R
50|$|Commercial hives {{have the}} same {{cross-sectional}} dimensions as a National hive (460mm x 460mm), but deeper brood box (267mm/10.5") and supers. The internal structure of the boxes is also simpler, resulting in wider frames (406mm/16") with shorter handles or <b>lugs.</b> The brood <b>box</b> is picked up using small hand holds cut into the external wall of the hive. Supers have this same feature, which some find difficult to use when the super is full of honey. Some beekeepers therefore use National supers {{on top of a}} Commercial brood box.|$|R
6000|$|He turned, stared, bawled {{something}} about [...] "crawling {{out in a}} thing like a dish cover," [...] and ran on to {{the gate of the}} house at the crest. A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servant's <b>box,</b> <b>lugged</b> it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver's seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.|$|R
50|$|Sweatbox {{was a low}} budget, high {{ambition}} project. Originally it was a three LP {{set that}} I <b>lugged</b> by the <b>box</b> load on early talking tours. Eventually it hit CD on Quarter Stick where it resided happily for many years. Now, we're remastering and re-releasing all the early material on 213, upgrading sonically with ace engineer Phil Klum at the helm and adding tracks when we can.The previous Sweatbox is missing one track off the original LP. It was recorded in Budapest, Hungary where I was asked to read for some students before the Rollins Band show that night. Anyway, we added it on this version as an extra track {{at the end of}} disc 2. If it's too awful for you, you can always just hit stop! At least the set will be slightly more definitive.Also, it's great to have Phil Klum go over these tapes and do all {{that can be done to}} clean them up and even out the levels. Definitely what a re-release should be all about. I hope you like these ancient recordings.|$|R
