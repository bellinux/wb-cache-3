5000|$|A {{market maker}} or <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> {{is a company}} or an {{individual}} that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping {{to make a profit}} on the bid-offer spread, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a [...] "market maker" [...] as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.|$|E
50|$|A collateralized {{mortgage}} obligation (CMO) {{is a type}} {{of complex}} debt security that repackages and directs the payments of principal and interest from a collateral pool to different types and maturities of securities, thereby meeting investor needs. CMOs were first created in 1983 by the investment banks Salomon Brothers and First Boston for the U.S. mortgage <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> Freddie Mac. (The Salomon Brothers team was led by Gordon Taylor. The First Boston team was led by Dexter Senft).|$|E
50|$|Aggregators usually provide {{two main}} functions; they allow FX traders to compare price from {{different}} liquidity venues such as banks-global market makers or ECNs like Currenex, FXall or Hotspot FX {{and to have}} a consolidated view of the market. They allow traders to trade with many participants using a single API or a single trading terminal. Some of the systems support order sweeping (an order is split into the chunks which are sent to the respective counterparties based on the price, time and other attributes of the quotes from these counterparties), other systems route the whole order to a single <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> who is chosen by an order routing algorithm embedded into an aggregator.|$|E
50|$|In {{a classic}} structure, the ECN will charge {{a small fee}} to all market {{participants}} using their network, both <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> and removers. They also can attract volume to their networks by giving lower prices to large <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers.</b> Fees for ECNs that operate under a classic structure range from $0 to $0.0015, or even higher depending on each ECN. This fee structure {{is more common in}} the NYSE, however recently some ECNs have moved their NYSE operations into a credit structure.|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} intraday {{variation}} in profits and quoting behavior of <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> at London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE), an electronic futures market, {{differ from those}} on an open outcry market, as documented by Ferguson and Mann’s (2001). They find that trading profits of <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers,</b> locals, at the open outcry futures markets are mainly determined by market maker obligations (or, more aptly, lack thereof) and pit trading. In {{the absence of the}} trading pit at an electronic market, adverse selection and inventory management of voluntary <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> affect trading profits of limit order traders {{in a manner similar to}} trading profits at transparent markets with liquidity supplied by competitive dealers. Examining separate evolutions of bid and ask quotes supports the notion that limit order traders pursue trading strategies different from those of locals...|$|R

The sample period ranges from May 2, 2006 to April 28, 2008. It includes 32 companies that switched from fixing to continuous trading and 25 companies that signed a <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> agreement. The empirical study indicates that the switch from fixing to continuous trading was successful with respect to the number of shares traded. However, <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> agreements do not significantly improve volume...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{benefits}} of having a private <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> and the conditions under which this lender provides liquidity, when a public <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> is also present. The model proposed incorporates an endogenous interbank lending market so that the decision of a bank to seek liquidity in the interbank market or to turn to the private or the public lender is also endogenous. This framework permits the derivation of conclusions on the size of the private lender, interbank lending conditions and optimal policy for liquidity provision. ...|$|E
40|$|A small {{investor}} provides liquidity {{at the best}} bid and ask prices of a limit order market. For small spreads and frequent orders of other market participants, we explicitly determine the investor’s optimal policy and welfare.

40|$|Since {{the affirmative}} {{obligations}} of <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> are costly, electronic markets have {{struggled with the}} means of providing compensation to <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> in return for assuming these obligations. This problem is acute for small stocks, which benefit most from the presence of designated <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers.</b> In this study, we examine the 2002 decision by the Stockholm Stock Exchange to allow listed firms to directly negotiate with liquidity suppliers for a desired level of liquidity {{in exchange for a}} negotiated fee. We find that benefits accrue to firms that enter into such arrangements in the form of significant improvements in market quality as well as price discovery. Further, we find that a firm’s stock price rises in direct proportion to the improvements in market quality. We study the determinants of the compensation for liquidity provision and document a link between contracted fees and the level of desired liquidity. By examining the trading of <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> we find that their propensity to supply liquidity increases at times of large spreads, and against market movements. Our findings suggest that firms should consider these market quality improvement opportunities as they do other capital budgeting decisions, {{especially in light of the}} positive externalities that we find accrue to the liquidity of the firms’ stocks. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a credit}} {{structure}} ECNs {{make a profit}} from paying <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> a credit while charging a debit to liquidity removers. Credits range from $0.002 to $0.00295 per share for <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers,</b> and debits from $0.0025 to $0.003 per share for liquidity removers. The fee can be determined by monthly volume provided and removed, or by a fixed structure, depending on the ECN. This structure is common on the NASDAQ market. NASDAQ Price List. Traders commonly quote the fees in millicents or mils (e.g. $0.00295 is 29.5 mils).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory agent-based {{model of a}} real time gross settlement (RTGS) payment system. Banks are represented as agents who exchange payment requests, which are then settled according {{to a set of}} simple rules. The model features the main elements of a real-life system, including a central bank acting as <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider,</b> and a simplified money market. A simulation exercise using synthetic data of BI-REL (the Italian RTGS) predicts the macroscopic impact of a disruptive event on the flow of interbank payments. In our reduced-scale system, three hypothetical distinct phases emerge after the disruptive event: 1) a liquidity sink effect is generated and the participantsĺiquidity expectations turn out to be excessive; 2) an illusory thickening of the money market follows, along with increased payment delays; and, finally 3) defaulted obligations dramatically rise. The banks cannot staunch the losses accruing on defaults, even after they become fully aware of the critical event, and a scenario emerges in which it might be necessary for the central bank to step in as <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider.</b> Agent-Based Modeling, Payment Systems, RTGS, Liquidity, Crisis Simulation...|$|E
40|$|In {{over-the-counter}} markets, {{a trader}} typically sources indicative quotes {{from a number}} of competing liquidity providers, and then sends a deal request on the best available price for consideration by the originating <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider.</b> Due to the communication and processing latencies involved in this negotiation, and in a continuously evolving market, the price may have moved by the time the <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> considers the trader’s request. At what point has the price moved too far away from the quote originally shown for the <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> to reject the deal request? Or perhaps the request can still be accepted but only on a revised rate? ‘Last look’ is the process that makes this decision, i. e. it determines whether to accept—and if so at what rate—or reject a trader’s deal request subject to the constraints of an agreed trading protocol. In this paper, I study how the execution risk and transaction costs faced by the trader are influenced by the last look logic and choice of trading protocol. I distinguish between various ‘symmetric’ and ‘asymmetric’ last look designs and consider trading protocols that differ on whether, and if so to what extent, price improvements and slippage can be passed on to the trader. All this is done within a unified framework that allows for a detailed comparative analysis. I present two main findings. Firstly, the choice of last look design and trading protocol determines the degree of execution risk inherent in the process, but the effective transaction costs borne by the trader need not be affected by it. Secondly, when a trader adversely selects the iquidity provider she chooses to deal with, the distinction between the different symmetric and asymmetric last look designs fades and the primary driver of execution risk is the choice of trading protocol...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} how {{the inception of}} an ETF market impacts several dimensions of the liquidity of the ETF-underlying-index stocks. In contrast with previous research, our evidence {{is based on an}} ETF market where liquidity providers (LPs) act as market makers. We find that: (1) the market for the underlying stocks becomes more liquid after the ETF ntroduction for investors who trade at the best-limit quotes; (2) but the stock market becomes ess deep for larger traders, most probably because some large liquidity traders exit the underlying stocks’ market for the ETF market. Some statistics suggest that those results could be related to the trading activity of ETF LPs. Transaction Costs; Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF); Index Trading; <b>Liquidity</b> <b>provider...</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of credit {{enhancement}}, and downgrades to credit enhancement providers, on the costs to municipal issuers for holding variable rate debt during the 2008 â€” 09 market crisis. Although municipal issuers were potentially subject to pressure on their debt issues due to credit contraction, {{the extent of the}} problem has not been well researched, especially regarding credit enhancement. This study empirically investigates whether <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> affect the cost of municipal variable rate debt and whether the impact is affected by credit downgrades of <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers.</b> Several important contributions are made. First, this research emphasizes the role of liquidity provision as a form of credit enhancement. Second, the value of liquidity provision is examined in the environment of credit downgrades to <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers.</b> Third, the research tests capital market efficiency using variable, as opposed to fixed rate debt, which allows for the identification of liquidity risk and default risk. municipal debt; variable rate; liquidity risk; credit risk; credit enhancement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{liquidity provision}} in an electronic limit order market around macroeconomic news releases when fast {{execution of orders}} is especially important. In limit order markets, {{where there is no}} designated <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider,</b> the liquidity situation is primarily determined by specific trading patterns. We find that scheduled information events are followed by a high immediate trading desire. However, the volume offered at limit prices is unusually low. This imbalance between liquidity demand and supply leads to a liquidity shortage reflected in high spreads. Moreover, we find that the shortage is asymmetric {{depending on the type of}} announced information and the absolute amount of its unexpected component.

40|$|This short paper, {{prepared}} as a keynote address, {{explains why the}} credit crunch is fundamentally a story about financial markets, not banks. Its cause was a collapse of securitization and other debt markets, which have become major sources of financing for consumers and companies. Deprived of this financing, consumers have had difficulty purchasing homes and automobiles, and companies have had difficulty purchasing inventory and making capital investments, causing the real economy to shrink. This paper examines how these financial markets should be protected. Although already subject to many prescriptive regulatory protections, these markets evolve faster than regulation can adapt. The paper argues that a market <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> of last resort is the most robust and cost-effective way to protect these financial markets when prescriptive regulation inevitably fails...|$|E
40|$|We {{employ the}} Reuters {{database}} to compare execution costs for 2, 330 matched-pair securities {{across the top}} 7 equity markets in the Dow Jones STOXX Global 1800 Index. This sample encompasses {{a wide variety of}} thirteen market design features. In addition, we investigate execution costs well beyond the most heavily traded stocks to include equities in the sixth through tenth deciles of traded value. Our findings indicate that full transparency of the limit order book to investors and a composite of unique NYSE features (but not the presence of the crowd) unequivocally reduce effective spreads. In contrast, a fully transparent limit order book revealed to brokers, the presence of a market maker, or the mixture of execution systems present on the LSE sharply increase effective spreads in both thickly and thinly-traded stocks. The effect of a physical trading floor is statistically significant but relatively small; it increases effective spreads slightly for thickly-traded firms, and reduces them for thinly-traded stocks. The findings for price impact are the same with three exceptions. First, the presence of a trading floor increases costs, dramatically so for thinlytraded stocks. Second, a fully transparent limit order book for brokers raises price impact for thickly traded stocks, but lowers price impacts for thinly traded firms. Third, in thinly-traded stocks, Londons hybrid market decreases price impact, and in thickly-traded stocks, crowd trading on the NYSE and full transparency to investors decrease price impact. Finally, the results for realised spread are essentially the same as those for effective spread, with the exception that the effect of the presence of a trading floor is to reduce realised spreads. Overall, the London Stock Exchange is the highest execution cost market, and the NYSE is the lowest. This research includes a market-specific study of the effect on execution cost of the <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Provider</b> of Euronext Paris. Euronext Paris affords a natural experimental research design because a third of firms have Liquidity Providers and two thirds do not. Results indicate quoted spreads, effective spreads and realized spreads are significantly affected by the presence of a <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Provider,</b> but price impacts are not. On the one hand, this suggests that the thickly-traded stocks where the Liquidity Providers are prohibited have sufficient liquidity in their absence. On the other hand however, liquidity providers on Euronext Paris reduce effective and realised spreads in essentially all stocks. This finding suggests that the limit order book refreshes much more quickly after developing an imbalance of large size orders when Liquidity Providers can facilitate other liquidity suppliers in assessing picking off risk. The <b>Liquidity</b> <b>Provider</b> increases quoted spreads for thickly-traded firms from the first three traded value deciles while reducing quoted spreads for the lower deciles...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we test the {{information}} hypothesis of price improvement. Our results show that price improvement is negatively related to both the probability of information-based trading and the price impact of trades. We interpret these results as evidence that <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> selectively offer price improvements according to the information content of trades. We also show that <b>liquidity</b> <b>providers</b> offer greater (and more frequent) price improvements when {{they are at the}} NBBO, and for stocks with wider spreads, fewer trades, or smaller trade sizes relative to the quoted depth. Buyer-initiated trades receive smaller (larger) price improvements than seller-initiated trades on the NYSE (NASDAQ).

40|$|We report {{evidence}} {{that the presence of}} hidden liquidity is associated with greater liquidity in the order books, greater trading volume, and smaller price impact. Limit and market order submission behavior changes when hidden liquidity is present consistent with at least some traders being able to detect hidden liquidity. We estimate a model of liquidity provision that allows us to measure variations in the marginal and total payoffs from liquidity provision in states with and without hidden liquidity. Our estimates of the expected surplus to providers of visible and hidden liquidity are positive and typically of the order of one-half to one basis points per trade. The positive <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> surpluses combined with the increased trading volume when hidden liquidity is present are both consistent with liquidity externalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{market maker}} plays an {{important}} role in price formation, but his/her behavior and stabilizing impact on the market are relatively unclear, in particular in speculative markets. This paper develops a financial market model that examines the impact on market stability of the market maker, who acts as both a <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> and an active investor in a market consisting of two types of boundedly rational speculative investors—the fundamentalists and trend followers. We show that the market maker does not necessarily stabilize the market when he/she actively manages the inventory to maximize profits, and that rather the market maker’s impact depends on the behavior of the speculators. Numerical simulations show that the model is able to generate outcomes for asset returns and market inventories that are consistent with empirical findings.

Using a sample of European listed firms, we confirm {{that there is a}} positive and significant relationship between CSP rating and a firm's liquidity and investor base. Consistent with the neglected stock effect, this relationship is sensitive to firm size. Our results have important implications for practitioners. Firstly, investment in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) could represent an alternative method of improving a company's stock market quality alongside <b>liquidity</b> <b>provider</b> contracting or market listing transfer. Secondly, when a firm's board investigates the opportunity to invest in CSR, it should consider the benefits of lowering the company's cost of capital through the aforementioned effects. Finally, from an asset manager's perspective, any change in CSP should be taken into account, as it can affect company valuation and therefore portfolio performance...|$|E

We find that stocks with greater information-based trading and in more competitive trading environments exhibit faster quote adjustments. The speed of quote adjustment is faster after decimalization in both markets. These results are robust and not driven by differences in stock attributes between the two markets or time periods. Overall, our results indicate that stock attributes, market structure, and tick size exert {{a significant impact on}} the speed of quote adjustment. Spreads...|$|R
