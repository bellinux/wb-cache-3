25|$|From {{the fall}} of 1952 to the spring of 1953 Rauschenberg {{traveled}} through Europe and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly. In Morocco, he created collages and boxes out of trash. He took them back to Italy and exhibited them at galleries in Rome and Florence. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> sold; those that did not he threw into the river Arno. From his stay, 38 collages survived. In a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by de Kooning, which he obtained from his colleague {{for the express purpose}} of erasing it as an artistic statement. The result is titled Erased de Kooning Drawing.|$|E

Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.|$|E

In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. [...] "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. [...] "I used to catch a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> one-handed", Lavelli said.

500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis.

500|$|This was {{the first}} time the Coen {{brothers}} chose big stars to act in their movie. Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins. Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink. Her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as, Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur. When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, [...] "Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names," [...] remembered Joel. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life." [...] However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India {{gave the}} film a 3.5 (out of 5) rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "serious, sensitive and stirring", [...] "a whole new cinematic experience" [...] and praising Chopra's performance: [...] "7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly {{end up as}} a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema. She renders a subtle and restrained portrayal of a lonely and wronged woman who wanted love and only love from life". Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave 7 Khoon Maaf three out of five stars noting that the film was crafted around strong, effective scenes alone: a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> cleanly cut and clinical, a whole lot immediately compelling, and recommended not to miss the partly captivating film Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film three stars, saying that [...] "7 Khoon Maaf is a dark film that {{has its share of}} positives and negatives. However, the film will meet with diverse reactions – some will fancy it, while some will abhor it. The film will appeal more to the critics/columnists and the festival circuit".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the film}} a decade after it came out, critic Danny Peary said he found Duvall's {{restrained}} portrayal [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and criticized the entire cast, save for Buckley, for their [...] "subdued, emotions-in-check, phony 'honest' performances. You just wish the whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would start tickling each other." [...] In his book Alternate Oscars, listing his personal opinions of who should have won the Academy Awards each year, Peary excluded Tender Mercies from all the categories, and chose Michael Caine as deserving of the Best Actor honor for Educating Rita. In June 2009, critic Roger Ebert included Tender Mercies in The Great Movies, his series of reviews celebrating what he considers the most important films of all time. He praised what he called one of Duvall's most understated performances, as well as Foote's minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford's direction. Ebert said of Foote's screenplay, [...] "The down-to-earth quality of his characters drew attention away from his minimalist storytelling; all the frills were stripped away.... Rarely does a movie elaborate less and explain more than Tender Mercies." ...|$|E
