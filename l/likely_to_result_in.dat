The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|DDT was {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} in agriculture {{that was found}} to have significant adverse effects on wildlife, particularly egg thinning and subsequent breakage in birds of prey. A review of DDT's impact on Australian raptors between 1947 and 1993 found that the average egg-shell thickness had decreased by 6%. This average level of thinning was not thought <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> significantly more breakage overall, however individual clutches that had been even thinner might have broken. The white-bellied sea eagle was one of the more affected species, probably due to its feeding in areas heavily treated with pesticide such as swamps. DDT use peaked in 1973, but was no longer approved after 1987 and its use had effectively ceased by 1989.|$|E

5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a runny nose.|$|E
5|$|The Anahim hotspot {{is set in}} {{a remote}} {{location}} accessed by a network of logging roads from Quesnel on Highway 97. Because of this, the most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only. Although not heavily populated, the area is home to forestry operations and the small community of Nazko. The presence of burned wood within Nazko tephra suggests that this area is prone to forest fires caused by volcanic eruptions. Also, if an eruption column were to be produced, it would disrupt local air traffic. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Renewed volcanism is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the creation of mafic cinder cones. The latest such event occurred with the eruption of Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. However, eruptions of less mafic magma, typical of earlier activity of the Anahim hotspot, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E

5|$|After Marathon, {{probably}} in 489, Miltiades, {{the hero of}} the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the Athenian people', but died weeks later {{as a result of his}} wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes's reforms, but remained so far unused. This was 'ostracism'each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (ostrakon) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades's prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> exile.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{was able to}} use her {{imposing}} battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany's smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.|$|E

5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve point sockets have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition.

40|$|A {{research}} study on prefab reinforced concrete buildings designed with older Technical Standards {{is presented in}} this paper, where {{attention is focused on}} hall-type industrial structures. A representative case study, which includes the main sources of seismic vulnerability, is examined in detail. The possible rigid rotation of the bottom end zone of columns, which are encased in smooth socket-type foundations, and the frictional contact between the neoprene pads situated on top of the columns and the terminal zone of the roof girders are modelled in time-history assessment analyses. The latter are initially carried out by assuming an elastic behaviour of columns, highlighting unsafe response conditions under seismic action scaled at the basic design earthquake level, and near-collapse at the maximum considered earthquake level, which is caused by the loss of support of several girders from the neoprene pads. A second step of the analyses, where plastic behaviour of columns is investigated by incorporating fiber-type plastic hinges at their bottom end sections, assesses a remarkable ductility demand, as well as potential collapse induced by the complete loss of support of girders. The high lateral displacements of columns may also cause failure of the fastenings of the connected cladding panels, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> their overturning-induced collapse. Based on these data, a supplemental damping-based retrofit hypothesis is proposed, consisting in the installation of dissipative braces equipped with pressurized fluid viscous spring-dampers. The protective system allows attaining a completely undamaged response of structural and non-structural members, and therefore meeting the requirements of the Immediate Occupancy limit state, up to the maximum considered earthquake level...|$|R
