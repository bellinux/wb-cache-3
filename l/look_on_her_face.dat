She is often also shown in peril: being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters. These covers are [...] "characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> or whether she is running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless. Nancy {{does not have}} any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, {{it is too late}} now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910.

500|$|She also sang [...] "Listen" [...] {{during the}} finals on December 21, 2011. A writer of Fox News Channel {{commented that the}} judges [...] "didn't want to stop {{listening}} to Melanie Amaro" [...] while she was singing a [...] "soaring rendition" [...] of the ballad. Simon Cowell said, [...] "I brought this show to America because I believe {{some of the greatest}} singers in the world are from this country, and you just proved that. I think you, based on that performance tonight, to me, should be the winner of 'The X Factor,' because you're going to represent this country all over the world." [...] L.A. Reid also commented, [...] "That wasn't a $5 million performance. That was a $50 million performance." [...] Sarah Maloy of Billboard magazine felt that her performance was [...] "as powerfully and passionately [...] as she did the first time". Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised Amaro's rendition, writing that it contained a [...] "determined <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> lots of generous spreading of the arms, and plenty of big notes". Amaro eventually emerged as the winner of The X Factor, performing this song for the final time.|$|E

After seeing {{a picture of a}} happy Beth and Puck, Quinn resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club, but Quinn reveals to Puck she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody. After Puck tells Shelby of Quinn's true intentions, Shelby informs Quinn that she does not want her in Beth's life. Quinn later reveals a desire to have a second baby with Puck. Puck refuses, and tries to comfort her; he offers to share an important secret if she promises not to tell anyone, which ultimately results in Quinn planning to get Shelby fired for sleeping with a student, Puck. Quinn decides not to reveal Shelby's secret for Beth's sake.|$|E

Airedale performed a Garth Brooks song and Winston the impersonating Turtle sang a Bee Gees song. Julius performed a Marvin Gaye song; Julius was a favorite when he {{appeared on}} The Oprah Winfrey Show.

2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not the <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|A detective {{from the}} Sheriff's Juvenile Aid Bureau, among others, {{was summoned to}} {{interview}} Brawley, but she remained unresponsive. The family requested a black officer, which the police department was able to provide. Brawley, described as having an [...] "extremely spacey" [...] <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> communicated with this officer with nods of the head, shrugs of the shoulder, and written notes. The interview lasted 20 minutes, during which she uttered only one word: [...] "neon". Through gestures and writing, however, she indicated she had been raped repeatedly in a wooded area by three white men, {{at least one of}} whom, she claimed, was a police officer. A sexual assault kit was administered, and police began building a case. Brawley provided no names or descriptions of her assailants. She later told others that there had been no rape, only other kinds of sexual abuse. Forensic tests found no evidence that a sexual assault of any kind had occurred. There was no evidence of exposure to elements, which would have been expected in a victim held for several days in the woods {{at a time when the}} temperature dropped below freezing at night.|$|E
2500|$|Her last {{release of}} the year was Yash Chopra's thriller Darr, {{alongside}} Shah Rukh Khan and Sunny Deol. The film {{went on to become a}} blockbuster upon its release and was one of the highest grossing films of the year, making it Chawla's fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. Darr was also a major critical success, winning several awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Her performance as Kiran, a girl caught between one man's love and other man's obsession was widely appreciated and to date remains one of her most memorable performances. A critic wrote [...] "In Darr she gets to display all her talent, be it the frightened <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> on seeing Rahul, be it the twinkle in the eyes during the song Tu hai meri Kiran or the comic chemistry with Anupam Kher, it is one of her best performances." [...] Rediff stated [...] "Sensuous, seductive, gorgeous, cute, vulnerable -Juhi looked every bit of a dream girl her Kiran needed to be." [...] Chawla's curly hair and off shoulder dress became the trademark in the 90s with her blockbuster Darr. All these successes made her the most successful actress of the year.|$|E

2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] will remind Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. The <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur is {{in a cell}} in {{the town}} prison, and Hook wants to know who Nimue is and what he’s hiding, but Arthur says that Emma took his {{memories}} so he doesn't know anything. David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes the <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E
