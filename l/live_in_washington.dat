25|$|Dolley Madison {{transferred}} (or deeded), {{most of the}} enslaved {{people to}} her son, John Payne Todd. He stipulated in his will that upon his death, the slaves would be manumitted. However, due to legal and financial complications after Todd's death, the slaves were not manumitted. The Taylors petitioned James C. Maguire, the administrator of the estate, for their freedom. After being officially freed in 1853, they chose to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> which had a large free black community and opportunities for varied work.|$|E
25|$|Jeremy Coleman (PD of New York's WNEW in 2000) {{became aware}} of Ron and Fez {{when he was a}} program {{director}} for WJFK-FM, the sister station he nurtured. He originally intended to bring the show to DC, but instead became WNEW's program director. One month later, on March 27, 2000, Ron and Fez began tape delay syndication in DC where they found a small but loyal fan base in a late night timeslot. In November 2002, WJFK's evening radio show The Sports Junkies relocated to WHFS, opening a timeslot for Ron and Fez to syndicate their show <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> DC (7p.m.–11 p.m.), following The Don and Mike Show.|$|E

2500|$|However, their reduced numbers {{resulted}} in the Sinixt being unable to control development of the area as it was flooded with miners during a second mineral rush in the 1880s and 1890s. [...] Several boomtowns were erected throughout the West Kootenay and Boundary Country regions. The majority of Sinixt continued to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> State on the Colville Reservation. [...] Nevertheless, a number of Sinixt remained permanently in Canada {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. [...] Many others also returned to their ancestral land in B.C., to hunt and fish during the summer months, well into the 20th Century.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bert {{was often}} drunk and {{infrequently}} home, Caresse did not lack for company. She extended {{an invitation to}} Salvador Dalí and his wife, who were long-term guests, during which he wrote much of his autobiography. In 1934, Dalí and his wife Gala attended a masquerade party in New York, hosted for them by Crosby. [...] Other visitors included Max Ernst, Buckminster Fuller, Stuart Kaiser, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Ezra Pound, and other friends from her time in Paris. She had a brief affair with Fuller during this time. [...] By 1941, having divorced Bert, Caresse moved to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. full-time, where she owned a home at 2008 Q Street NW from 1937 to 1950, and she opened the Caresse Crosby Modern Art Gallery, {{what was then the}} city's only modern art gallery, at 1606 Twentieth Street, near Dupont Circle.|$|E

2500|$|Frances Eliza Hodgson {{was born}} in Cheetham, Manchester, England. [...] After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened {{circumstances}} and in 1865 emigrated to the United States, settling in Jefferson City, Tennessee. [...] There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines {{from the age of}} 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o' Lowrie's), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children's fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped\ to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and ALittle Princess.|$|E

60|$|Such as it is, it {{is likely}} to remain. It was {{originally}} chosen for the seat of Government, as a means of averting the conflicting jealousies and interests of the different States; and very probably, too, as being remote from mobs: a consideration not to be slighted, even in America. It has no trade or commerce of its own: having little or no population beyond the President and his establishment; the members of the legislature who reside there during the session; the Government clerks and officers employed in the various departments; the keepers of the hotels and boarding- houses; and the tradesmen who supply their tables. It is very unhealthy. Few people would <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> I take it, who were not obliged to reside there; and the tides of emigration and speculation, those rapid and regardless currents, are little likely to flow at any time towards such dull and sluggish water.|$|E

That land-agent {{used to tell}} Dryfoos {{to get out to}} Europe {{with his}} money and see life a little, or go and <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> where he could be somebody; but Dryfoos wouldn't, and he kept listening to the talk there, {{and all of a sudden}} he caught on. He came into that fellow's one day with a plan for cutting up the eighty acres he'd kept into town lots; and he'd got it all plotted out so-well, and had so many practical ideas about it, that the fellow was astonished. He went right in with him, as far as Dryfoos would let him, and glad of the chance; and they were working the thing for all it was worth when I struck Moffitt. Old Dryfoos wanted me to go out and see the Dryfoos & Hendry Addition--guess he thought maybe I'd write it up; and he drove me out there himself. Well, it was funny to see a town made: streets driven through; two rows of shadetrees, hard and soft, planted; cellars dug and houses put up-regular Queen Anne style, too, with stained glass-all at once. Dryfoos apologized for the streets because they were hand-made; said they expected their street-making machine Tuesday, and then they intended to push things." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{believe in}} its general evil {{effects on the}} white race. See our present condition--the country engaged in war--white men cutting one another's throats--none knowing how far it will extend--and then {{consider}} what we know to be the truth: But for your race among us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you {{one way or the}} other. Nevertheless I repeat, without the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men among you, who, even if they could better their condition, are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those who, being slaves, could obtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe that you can <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>WASHINGTON,</b> or elsewhere in the United States, the remainder of your life, as easily, perhaps more so, than you can in any foreign Country; and hence you may {{come to the conclusion that}} you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.|$|E
