5|$|Following {{the early}} exit in the Houston Regional {{due to the}} upset by the Aggies, Humber <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone {{so early in the}} same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{graduated}} on July 1, 1843, ranked 21st in a {{class of}} 39, and was promoted to the rank brevet second lieutenant. Glad to leave the academy, he planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment. He served as regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment. Grant's first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the west. Grant was happy with his new commander, but <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of his military service and a possible teaching career.|$|E
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E

He spoke against {{the power of the}} West Indian sugar planters and <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ending of Caribbean slavery. He warned of the disastrous consequences for the Indian economy of British colonialism. After the Reform Act of 1832, he won the new parliamentary seat of Wolverhampton for the Whigs after a bitterly contested campaign. One of his major concerns was providing new opportunities for working-class people through emigration, and he strongly opposed the use of convict and slave labour everywhere. His last contribution in parliament was on the subject of emigration to South Australia.|$|E
25|$|Between 1803 and 1854, the United States {{achieved}} a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation and conquest. Of the states {{carved out of}} these territories by 1845, all had entered the union as slave states: Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida and Texas, {{as well as the}} southern portions of Alabama and Mississippi. And with the conquest of northern Mexico, including California, in 1848, slaveholding interests <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> institution flourishing in these lands as well. Southerners also anticipated garnering slaves and slave states in Cuba and Central America. Northern free soil interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave soil. It was these territorial disputes that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided over.|$|E

With Obama now leading by 164 pledged delegates {{and with only}} 217 pledged delegates left to be decided in the remaining contests, many pundits declared that the primary was effectively over.

For {{the first time}} in the club's history, FCK entered the group stage of the Champions League, being grouped with Celtic, Benfica and Manchester United, all former winners of the trophy. Despite not losing a game at Parken (Benfica 0–0, Manchester United 1–0 and Celtic 3–1), FCK failed to qualify from the Champions League group stage after losing all of its away games. On 9 May, Copenhagen defeated Brøndby 1–0 and won its fifth Danish championship in seven years with four games to spare in the league.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, {{within weeks}} of Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the German Consul-General in Jerusalem for Palestine, Heinrich Wolff, sent a {{telegram}} to Berlin reporting al-Husseini's belief that Palestinian Muslims were enthusiastic about the new regime and <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spread of Fascism throughout the region. Wolff met al-Husseini and many sheikhs again, a month later, at Nabi Musa. They expressed their approval of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany and asked Wolff not to send any Jews to Palestine. Wolff subsequently wrote in his annual report for that year that the Arabs' political naïvety led them to fail to recognize the link between German Jewish policy and their problems in Palestine, and that their enthusiasm for Nazi Germany was devoid of any real understanding of the phenomenon. The various proposals by Palestinian Arab notables like al-Husseini were rejected consistently over the years out of concern to avoid disrupting Anglo-German relations, in line with Germany's policy of not imperilling their economic and cultural {{interests in the region}} by a change in their policy of neutrality, and respect for British interests. Hitler's Englandpolitik essentially precluded significant assistance to Arab leaders. Italy also made the nature of its assistance to the Palestinian contingent on the outcome of its own negotiations with Britain, and cut off aid when it appeared that the British were ready to admit the failure of their pro-Zionist policy in Palestine. Al-Husseini's adversary, Ze'ev Jabotinsky had at the same time cut off Irgun ties with Italy after the passage of antisemitic racial legislation.|$|E

500|$|One of Hitler's {{sub-goals}} for {{the invasion}} of Russia was to win over Britain to the German side. He believed that after the military collapse of the USSR, [...] "within a few weeks" [...] Britain would be forced either into a surrender or else come to join Germany as a [...] "junior partner" [...] in the Axis. Britain's role in this alliance was reserved to support German naval and aerial military actions against the USA in a fight for world supremacy conducted from the Axis power bases of Europe, Africa and the Atlantic. On August 8, 1941, Hitler stated that he <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eventual day when [...] "England and Germany [...] together against America" [...] and on January 7, 1942, he daydreamed that it was [...] "not impossible" [...] for Britain to quit the war and join the Axis side, leading to a situation where [...] "it will be a German-British army that will chase the Americans from Iceland". National Socialist ideologist Alfred Rosenberg hoped that after the victorious conclusion of {{the war against the}} USSR, Englishmen, along with other Germanic nationalities, would join the German settlers in colonizing the conquered eastern territories.|$|E

500|$|... "Old John Robertson", {{which had}} already been issued some six months earlier as the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single, was another country-tinged song that <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's future country rock experimentation. The song was {{inspired}} by a retired film director who lived in the small town near San Diego where Hillman grew up. John S. Robertson was something of an eccentric figure around the town, regularly wearing a Stetson hat and sporting a white handlebar moustache, which gave him the appearance of a character out of the old American West. In the song, Hillman recalls the children of the town and their cruel laughter at this colorful figure, as well as the combination of awe and fear that he elicited in the townsfolk. During the recording of the song, Crosby switched instruments with Hillman to play bass instead of his usual rhythm guitar. The track also makes liberal use of the studio effects known as phasing and flanging, particularly during the song's orchestral middle section and subsequent verse. The version of [...] "Old John Robertson" [...] found on the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single is a substantially different mix from the version that appears on The Notorious Byrd Brothers album.|$|E
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage gave a {{favourable}} {{review of}} the episode. He referred to his review of [...] "Midnight", {{when he said that}} it was Davies' best script so far and wondered if Davies would better it with the last three episodes, and wrote that the episode [...] "possibly just nudges ahead" [...] of [...] "Midnight". Wright explained that [...] "Turn Left" [...] struck resonance with him because the episode highlighted how important the Doctor is to the fictional universe. His review praised Tate's acting as Donna before she met the Doctor as a [...] "real character performance" [...] which exemplified Tate's multi-faceted portrayal. His main points of criticism were the appearance of Rose and the Time Beetle prosthetic: he was [...] "non-plussed" [...] about Rose's reappearance, but he admitted that Piper was an [...] "integral part of the early success of new Who"; and he thought the prosthetic beetle was [...] "an unconvincing lump of plastic" [...] and was reminiscent of the classic series' low budget. He closed his review by saying the episode [...] "says as much about Doctor Who’s past as well as its future", and <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last two episodes of the series.|$|E

[...] The second stated [...] "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] It continued, [...] "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed". The Independent <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event, saying that [...] "It {{was just a matter}} of time before Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond hatched another prank and put a grin back on the face of pop music." [...] "You just ache for them to be No. 1 again....", they said, but [...] "One hopes they are not about to shoot themselves in the foot" [...] because [...] "the idea walks the tightrope between lunacy and brilliance.... the pop world's countdown to the millennium surely starts here".|$|E
