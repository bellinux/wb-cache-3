She kindly invited us to stay a little <b>longer.</b> <b>We</b> don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. [...] "More and more", she wrote, [...] "we {{have come to the conclusion}} that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> have decided to leave." ...|$|E

Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Revolutions per Minute was {{released}} on April 8, 2003. Like The Unraveling, it failed to reach any major record charts, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart in the United States. Critics praised the album for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore; Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone called Revolutions per Minute [...] "easily among the finest punk records of the past decade". To support the album, Rise Against traveled with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name on North American and Japan based tours, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. When asked about the band's early years with Fat Wreck Chords, Principe said: [...] "Our goal was to be on Fat Wreck Chords and just sell enough records so that when we were home from tour, we wouldn't have to get jobs...Of course, that was all before we had families and children and numerous responsibilities. That was the beauty. And then the <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> did it things just kept coming our way." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{significant}} debate regarding {{the urgency of}} addressing the short-term and long-term budget challenges. Prior to the 2008-2009 U.S. recession, experts argued for steps {{to be put in}} place immediately to address an unsustainable trajectory of federal deficits. For example, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in January 2007: [...] "The <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> wait, the more severe, the more draconian, the more difficult the objectives are going to be.

2500|$|Million Dollar Bill is an uptempo [...] "pop dance groove" [...] {{with strong}} disco influences. The song lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty three seconds. Written in they key of B Minor, the song's beat is set in common time and moves at a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Houston's voice spans A3 to the note of B4. The song also {{features}} a sample of Loleatta Holloway's 1977 song [...] "We're Getting Stronger (The <b>Longer</b> <b>We</b> Stay Together)". Swizz Beatz explained that the song [...] "is all about the feelings new love can bring".|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, at 10:00am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles {{began working}} their way through their live set song by song, the number of takes varying on each, and {{finished}} at 10:45pm—less than 13 hours later— capturing in essence an authentic representation of the band's Cavern Club-era sound. The day ended with a cover of [...] "Twist and Shout", {{which had to be}} recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: [...] "I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day but the <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> go on the better they get." [...] Mark Lewisohn would later write: [...] "There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music" [...] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on [...] "A Taste of Honey" [...] and Lennon added harmonica onto [...] "There's a Place" [...] during these sessions. Martin overdubbed piano on [...] "Misery" [...] and celesta on [...] "Baby It's You" [...] on 20 February, during which the Beatles were not present.|$|E

2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} {{were now}} to have major consequences {{for the war in}} Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was [...] "now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [...] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war." [...] The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;" [...] wrote Marlborough, [...] "for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year <b>longer,</b> <b>we</b> cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days." ...|$|E
