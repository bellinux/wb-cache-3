6000|$|Hazlewood was, however, so {{far from}} eagerly <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> prospect, though it had the {{recommendation}} that great part of the land was his father's, and must necessarily be his own, that his head still turned backward towards the chimneys of Woodbourne, although at every step his horse made the difficulty of employing his eyes in that direction become greater. From the reverie {{in which he was}} sunk he was suddenly roused by a voice, too harsh to be called female, yet too shrill for a man: 'What's kept you on the road sae lang?

6000|$|Mr. Brumley avoided {{as much as}} {{he could}} looking at Lady Harman, because he knew Sir Isaac was alert for that, but he was acutely aware of her {{presence}} dispensing the tea and moving about the room, being a good wife. It was his first impression of Lady Harman as a good wife and he disliked the spectacle extremely. The conversation hovered chiefly about Marienbad, drifted away and came back again. Mrs. Harman made several confidences that provoked the betrayal of a strain of irritability in Sir Isaac's condition. [...] "We're all <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> Marienbad expedition," [...] she said. [...] "I do hope it will turn out well. Neither of them have ever been abroad before--and there's the difficulty of the languages." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the time}} fixed the Marchesa's {{carriage}} came, and Ayala with her boxes {{was taken away}} to Brook Street. Uncle Reginald had offered {{to do something for}} her in the way of buying a frock, but this she refused, declaring that she would not allow herself to become an expense merely because her friends in Rome had been kind to her. So she had packed up the best of what she had and started, with her heart in her mouth, fearing the grandeur of the Marchesa's house. On her arrival she was received by Nina, who at once threw herself into all her old intimacy. [...] "Oh, Ayala," [...] she said, [...] "this is so nice to have you again.

60|$|As Roger had heard, from her, that a {{trade was}} carried on by Mexico with the {{surrounding}} countries, by merchants who traveled in parties, with strong bodies of armed men, {{and that they had}} been at Tabasco but a few days only before he had first arrived there, and might be expected again in about a year, he was not surprised at the news. He had, indeed, been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> visit; for he felt that his position was getting more and more unsafe, and that the cazique would not be able, much longer, to support him against the hostility {{of the majority of the}} men of importance in the town. What he had heard from Malinche had greatly raised his curiosity with regard to her country, and his longing to see these people, whom she described as invincible in war, and so infinitely superior in civilization to the Tabascans.|$|E

[...] "I tell you--what I have hardly hitherto told to myself--that all my dreams, all my wishes hitherto, {{have looked}} forward to precisely the juncture that seems now to be approaching. My dreaming childhood dreamt of this. If you know anything of me, you know how I sprung out of mystery, akin to none, a thing concocted out of the elements, without visible agency; how all through my boyhood I was alone; how I grew up without a root, yet continually longing for one,--longing to be connected with somebody, and never feeling myself so. Yet {{there was ever a}} <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> time at which I now find myself. If my next step were death, yet while the path seemed to lead toward a certainty of establishing me in connection with my race, I would take it. I have tried to keep down this yearning, to stifle it, annihilate it, by making a position for myself, by being my own fact; but I cannot overcome the natural horror of being a creature floating in the air, attached to nothing; ever this feeling that there is no reality in the life and fortunes, good or bad, of a being so unconnected. There is not even a grave, not a heap of dry bones, not a pinch of dust, with which I can claim kindred, unless I find it here!" ...|$|E
60|$|Most of your hosts, I fancy, run you out {{of their}} houses without first saying what they think of you. Their one desire is to be rid of you. Perhaps they are afraid to {{denounce}} you to your face. I want, however, to tell you that I have been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> moment ever since you put me to bed. I said little while I was there, but I thought a good deal, and most of my thoughts were of you. You fancied yourself invisible, but I saw you glaring at me, and I clenched my fists beneath the blankets. I could paint your portrait. You are very tall and stout, with a black beard, and a cruel, unsteady eye, and you have a way of crackling your fingers while you exult in your power. I used to lie watching you as you lolled in my cane-chair. At first it was empty, but I felt that you were in it, and gradually you took shape. I could hear your fingers crackling, and the chair creak as you moved in it. If I sat up in fear, you disappeared, but as soon as I lay back, there you were again. I know now that in a sense you were a creature of my imagination. I have discovered something more. I know why you seemed tall and stout and bearded, and why I heard your fingers crackling.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Ambrose {{looked and}} listened obediently enough, but {{inwardly}} she was prey to an uneasy mood not readily to be ascribed {{to any one}} cause. Looking on shore as Mr. Flushing bade her, she thought the country very beautiful, but also sultry and alarming. She {{did not like to}} feel herself the victim of unclassified emotions, and certainly as the launch slipped on and on, in the hot morning sun, she felt herself unreasonably moved. Whether the unfamiliarity of the forest was the cause of it, or something less definite, she could not determine. Her mind left the scene and occupied itself with anxieties for Ridley, for her children, for far-off things, such as old age and poverty and death. Hirst, too, was depressed. He had been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> expedition as to a holiday, for, once away from the hotel, surely wonderful things would happen, instead of which nothing happened, and here they were as uncomfortable, as restrained, as self-conscious as ever. That, of course, was what came of looking forward to anything; one was always disappointed. He blamed Wilfrid Flushing, who was so well dressed and so formal; he blamed Hewet and Rachel. Why didn't they talk? He looked at them sitting silent and self-absorbed, and the sight annoyed him. He supposed that they were engaged, or about to become engaged, but instead of being in the least romantic or exciting, that was as dull as everything else; it annoyed him, too, to think that they were in love. He drew close to Helen and began to tell her how uncomfortable his night had been, lying on the deck, sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold, and the stars so bright that he couldn't get to sleep. He had lain awake all night thinking, and when it was light enough to see, he had written twenty lines of his poem on God, and the awful thing was that he'd practically proved the fact that God did not exist. He did not see that he was teasing her, and he went on to wonder what would happen if God did exist--"an old gentleman in a beard and a long blue dressing gown, extremely testy and disagreeable as he's bound to be? Can you suggest a rhyme? God, rod, sod--all used; any others?" ...|$|E
