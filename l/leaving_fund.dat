40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how fund mangers, as cultured observers, make sense of social, {{environmental}} and ethical (SEE) information about companies. The paper uses a qualitative research approach involving in depth interviews with fund managers in Sweden. The analysis is influenced by a combination of system and network theories where social networks are imposed on fund managers when they make sense of corporate information. With reference to a growing SRI market, the rationales of social forces imposed on fund managers do not seem to have changed in order for them to include social aspects. Instead, these aspects are taken care of elsewhere in organizations, <b>leaving</b> <b>fund</b> managers as nodes in social networks, outside. However, if social aspects become an issue for the market positioning of companies, they could probably make more of a difference to the rationales of social forces surrounding fund managers.

40|$|Abstract: Decentralizing the {{allocation}} of public goods by giving funds directly to communities takes advantage of local information concerning needs, but decreases the accountability over how <b>funds</b> are used; <b>leaving</b> <b>funds</b> open to misuse or capture by local elites. In Indonesia, the World Bank attempts to overcome this downside of decentralized allocation by having communities compete locally for block grants. Competition weeds out less efficient projects. Increasing the number of villages bidding by 10 % leads to a 1. 8 % decline in road construction costs. Microcredit gives {{a measure of the}} diversion of funds, since in the initial phase of this program microcredit involved little monitoring and low repayment rates. Competition reduces the funds allocated to microcredit. Hence competition between localities for development funds has a significant impact on efficiency. Similarly, increased community participation in project planning and in {{the allocation}} of funding leads to better outcomes...|$|R

Its contribution to cultural - rather than museum - studies lies in its emphasis on the museum artefact as 'thing' (as opposed to 'document'); its use of media theory to analyse how museums and exhibitions stage their objects; and its rewriting of the standard history of museums in terms of a 'return to curiosity' in which museums anticipate, produce and reinvent the technological means and media of their day...|$|R
