Under the university's Commercial Music Program, Hoot/Wisdom Recordings was created in 2002, enabling students to work in all creative and business aspects of the music industry. This program generated music that landed a Top 10spot on the Billboard's Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles Sales Chart during its first week of release. The university's two-story trading room simulator, located in the College of Business, provides hands-on financial education using 25dual-monitor computers and can accommodate 50people at one time. A second lab provides full audio/visual connectivity and 25additional workstations. Florida Atlantic allows local financial businesses to use the Trading Room for training.|$|E

The Ten Year Development Plan for ICT in Education 2011-2020 was formalized in 2012.

Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of the seventeen <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> being roused, several fresh pamphlets appeared; the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> corresponded with the native learned societies; the native <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> translated the pamphlets of the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> into English; the foreign <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> translated the pamphlets of the native <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> into all sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.|$|R

Taking as a starting point Kenneth J.

Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.|$|E

50|$|A <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> is {{generally}} considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place.From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a <b>learning</b> <b>society</b> gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‘koinosophic’ or ‘wise’ society).|$|E
50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the {{distinction}} between a <b>learned</b> <b>society</b> and a professional body is not well defined.

40|$|<b>Learned</b> <b>societies</b> are “a {{critical}} part of the research environment ”, and many rely largely on subscription income from their journals publishing programme to support the other services they offer to their members in the promotion of their academic dis c ipline. As a result, they are facing enormous challenges as the journals publishing landscape becomes more complex and established revenues are threatened. Following {{the publication of the}} UK Finch Group’s report on expanding access to research publications, there is genuine concern that <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> could potentially stand to lose out significantly if Open Access is widely adopted. They are understandably worried about the future sustainability of their organizations and the knock - on effect on the subject research communit ies they support and serve. Questions are being asked about how societies, especially those that are small with limited resources, can remain viable in an Open Access world? How should publishing partners be help ing to support societies with their journal publishing programme s to allow them to continue their mission on behalf of their members? With these issues in mind TBI Communications, on behalf of EDP Sciences, undertook a programme of research to help understand more fully the attitudes of professional and <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> towards Open Access (OA), their evolving needs; and how a publishing partner can effectively support them in an OA environment. There were two steps to the research, 1) an online survey to professional and <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> and to supplement these findings, 2) a focus group to a wider range of representatives from the academic publishing industry. The survey was answered by 33 <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> and the results were further supplemented by a focus group held at the annual UKSG meeting in Harrogate in April. Key findings include: 	<b>Learned</b> <b>societies</b> overwhelmingly agree that Open Access will inevitably place some learned societies’ journals into financial jeopardy. 	Competing with large Open Access specialist publishers was also considered a significant challenge for <b>learned</b> <b>societies.</b> 	Gold Open Access is the Open Access method that is least offered by <b>learned</b> <b>society</b> journals, however nearly two-thirds of <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> indicated {{that they would like to}} be offering this option. 	More than ever before, with so many journals being published Open Access of dubious origin, <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> should look to endorse content with a stamp of quality and authority. 	Collaboration between <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> could help in the transition to Open Access, by pooling resources and sharing complex tasks. 	Two-thirds of all <b>learned</b> <b>societies</b> are also looking for support on best approach to OA, and compliance with funder mandates...|$|R
