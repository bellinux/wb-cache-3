25|$|The {{change in}} {{subsidies}} {{is intended to}} be completed by 2011, but individual governments have some freedom to decide how the new scheme will be introduced. The UK government has decided to run a dual system of subsidies in England, each year transferring a larger proportion of the total payment to the new scheme. Payments under the old scheme were frozen at their levels averaged over 2002–2003 and reduce each subsequent year. This allows farmers in England a period where their income is maintained, but which they can use to change farm practices to accord with the new regime. Other governments have chosen to wait, and change the system in one go at the latest possible time. Governments also have <b>limited</b> <b>discretion</b> to continue to direct a small proportion of the total subsidy to support specific crops. Alterations to the qualifying rules meant that many small landowners became eligible to apply for grants and the Rural Payments Agency in England received double the previous number of applications (110,000).|$|E

40|$|We address two concerns: trade {{liberalisation}} {{may lead to}} a race-to-the bottom in environmental standards; supra-national agencies, who might overcome this, may be captured by special interest groups. This raises two sets of choices: whether to set environmental policy at the national or supra-national level, and whether to <b>limit</b> political <b>discretion</b> by agencies. In Johal and Ulph (2001 a) we showed that policy should always be set at the supra- national level, whether or not political <b>discretion</b> was <b>limited,</b> and that it would never pay to <b>limit</b> political <b>discretion</b> at the supra-national level unless it was also limited at the national level. In that paper there were exogenous probabilities of agencies being captured by one group or another. In this paper the probabilities of capture depend on the lobbying efforts of interest groups.

40|$|Governments {{and private}} firms try to contain {{corruption}} among their staff mostly in a top-down, rules-based approach.

This embraces the invigorating of social control systems, encouraging whistle-blowing, coding of good practice and alerting to red flags. This paper investigates how some top-down measures run counter to bottom-up contributions. Examples range from penalties imposed with zero-tolerance, debarment or the nullity of contracts. While top-down elements are indispensable for containing corruption they must be designed well in order to avoid discouraging the bottom-up endeavors.

50|$|Shall-issue with <b>limited</b> <b>discretion</b> is {{a subset}} of shall-issue {{licensing}} that borders between pure shall-issue and may-issue policy, where an issuing authority has a limited degree of discretion to deny applicants a concealed carry permit based either on the applicant's suitability or reason for requesting a permit, even after the applicant has completed any required training and passed a background check. In states with such licensing practices, the issuing authority {{would be required to}} demonstrate with substantiating evidence, that the applicant is either not suitable or lacks appropriate need for the permit.

40|$|This study {{argues that}} the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is a {{constrained}} agent of Europe’s foreign policy. The 2009 Lisbon Treaty reform created the remodelled version of the High Representative of the Union as a potentially powerful agent to represent and coordinate Europe’s foreign policy. However, the analysis shows {{how and why the}} member states granted only <b>limited</b> <b>discretion</b> to the new foreign policy actor during {{the first years of the}} post’s existence. The aim of the study is to reveal the conditions of discretion of the High Representative. With the use of a principal-agent (PA) approach, the study shows that conflicting preferences of the member states, tight control mechanisms, as well as inadequate cooperation with the European Commission limited the High Representative’s room for manoeuvre. The findings suggest that the PA approach can be developed further in the future in order to better explain <b>limited</b> <b>discretion</b> of agents in matters of foreign policy. Based on the findings, the study also puts forward a number of characteristics of a ‘constrained agent’. It is suggested that the post of High Representative has the potential to emancipate from its status of a constrained agent over time, and to gain credibility as a foreign policy actor...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the preceding article, Professor Kennedy argues that executive discretion in trade remedies often destroys the protection for domestic industry that the U.

Professor Kennedy concludes that the Carter Administration’s settlement of all claims for antidumping duties, for approximately one-half of the duties originally imposed, denied meaningful relief to American industries. Professor Kennedy asserts Congress intended to <b>limit</b> executive <b>discretion</b> in antidumping law under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, but that the courts in Zenith Radio misconstrued congressional intent.
