25|$|As {{early as}} December 1666, Pepys had commented on Holmes's {{stubborn}} {{opposition to the}} <b>laying-up</b> of the fleet in expectation of peace. Holmes was alive to the danger of a Dutch assault - which duly came on 10 June 1667, when Michiel de Ruyter during the Raid on the Medway entered the Medway, burned {{a large part of}} the fleet in ordinary (i.e. laid up) at Chatham and hijacked Royal Charles. After that year's campaign had ended, Parliament's interest in naval administration intensified, much to Pepys's and Coventry's distress. Rupert and Albemarle, like most naval officers, especially of the Cavalier and gentleman sort, had long been unhappy with the off-hand treatment they received from the administrators. These, in turn, found the officers arrogant and unruly. Now the commanders-in-chief and their clients, Sir Frescheville Holles, Holmes and others, might strike back, especially after the Medway disaster. In addition, Holmes in the winter of 1666/1667 had revived the quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith (possibly even fighting a duel with him), which was only ended when the latter took Sir William Penn's place on the Navy Board (which again Holmes had hoped would be his) in December 1668. After peace was concluded, Holmes intensified his hold in the Isle of Wight by buying the governorship from Lord Colepeper. This put him in responsibility of the defences there (Sandown, Carisbrooke and Yarmouth Castles), but also gave him access to the very lucrative vice-admiralty of the Isle of Wight, Newport and Hampshire, with two-thirds of the value of all prizes taken there due to him. In addition, in October 1669, he was elected Member of Parliament for Winchester, generally supporting the Crown in Parliament.|$|E

6000|$|Nobody, {{except he}} has tried it, {{knows what it is}} to be an editor. It is easy to scribble local rubbish, with the facts all before you; it is easy to clip {{selections}} from other papers; it is easy to string out a correspondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to write editorials. Subjects are the trouble--the dreary lack of them, I mean. Every day, it is drag, drag, drag--think, and worry and suffer--all the world is a dull blank, and yet the editorial columns must be filled. Only give the editor a subject, and his work is done--it is no trouble to write it up; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains dry every day in the week, fifty-two weeks in the year. It makes one low spirited simply to think of it. The matter that each editor of a daily paper in America writes in the course of a year would fill from four to eight bulky volumes like this book! Fancy what a library an editor's work would make, after twenty or thirty years' service. Yet people often marvel that Dickens, Scott, Bulwer, Dumas, etc., have been able to produce so many books. If these authors had wrought as voluminously as newspaper editors do, the result would be something to marvel at, indeed. How editors can continue this tremendous labor, this exhausting consumption of brain fibre (for their work is creative, and not a mere mechanical <b>laying-up</b> of facts, like reporting), day after day and year after year, is incomprehensible. Preachers take two months' holiday in midsummer, for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing, in the long run. In truth it must be so, and is so; and therefore, how an editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten to twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year round, is farther beyond comprehension than ever. Ever since I survived my week as editor, I have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper that comes to my hand; it is in admiring the long columns of editorial, and wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it! ...|$|E

5000|$|Barely a {{month after}} his release and full pardon, Holmes assumed command of , a third-rate of 58 guns, the senior captain of Rupert's white (van) squadron. When {{at the battle of}} Lowestoft (3 June 1665) the rear-admiral of the white, Robert Sansum, was killed, Holmes claimed his post (which Rupert endorsed), but James gave the flag to his own flag captain, Harman. Holmes lost his temper and {{resigned}} his commission. Even worse, Holmes's rival Sir Jeremiah Smith was promoted to flag rank. But reconciliation was, again, not far away. On 27 March 1666, the powerful new third-rate Defiance (64) was launched in the presence of Charles II, James and Rupert, Holmes having been appointed captain and being knighted on the occasion. Part of the red squadron, Holmes was finally given acting flag-rank when the fleet was divided to shadow the Dutch and simultaneously intercept the French (which put him, satisfyingly, one step above Harman, rear-admiral of the white - a slighting of the principle of seniority which would have been unthinkable {{at the end of the}} century). During the murderous Four Days Battle, Holmes was reported to have [...] "done wonders" [...] (CSP Dom., 7 June 1666), and was confirmed as rear-admiral of the red, his ship having received such a battering that he transferred his flag to the partially burnt and dismasted Henry (72), Harman's ship, who had been wounded. But again, his rivals Sir Jeremiah Smith (made admiral of the blue) and Sir Edward Spragge (vice-admiral of the blue) were promoted above him. These professional rivalries were a hallmark of the restoration navy, and Holmes used the conduct of the St James' Day Fight, to start a bitter quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith, whose rear squadron had been routed by Cornelis Tromp. The recriminations between the officers and their respective factions played a role in the subsequent Parliamentary investigation over embezzlement in the naval administration and the conduct of the war. On 9 August 1666, Holmes achieved his best-known feat, characteristically (and, to Pepys and Coventry, exasperatingly) using his own judgement in interpreting his orders. Holmes was to land five hundred men on the island of Vlieland and four hundred on Terschelling and loot and destroy as much as possible. Instead of this, Holmes executed a fireship attack on the mass of merchantmen lying in Vlie Road, destroying some 150 ships, and sacked the Mennonite town of West-Terschelling. This, Holmes's Bonfire, was the heaviest blow the English ever dealt Dutch merchant shipping, severely endangering the Netherlands' war effort, at the cost of no more than twelve English casualties.Holmes now was in high favour. Early in 1667 he was appointed to command a squadron based in Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, a lucrative appointment that even enabled him to fit one of the squadron's prizes as a privateer.As early as December 1666, Pepys had commented on Holmes's stubborn opposition to the <b>laying-up</b> of the fleet in expectation of peace.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation on the mechanical properties of the laboratory size rectangular concrete beams with the notch formation on the tension surface strengthened by using fibre reinforced plastic composites. Fibre-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have been embedded at the interface between the concrete surface and external bonded composites to measure the strain variations when the strengthened structures were subjected to three-point bending load. Multiplexing strainsensing technique has been used for measuring the strains in different locations of the beam by using one single optical fibre. External bonded strain gauges were also attached on the surfaces of composites to measure the surface strain and the results were compared with that obtained from the embedded FBG sensors. The observation in the experiments showed that the flexural load capacity of the strengthened concrete beams was increased significantly after strengthening by <b>laying-up</b> the composite laminate for both plain and notched concrete structures. Debond and concrete failure occurred at the plate end region when the thick composite laminate was used. The embedded FBG sensors could provide the indication to the operator when the structure serviced in strange conditions.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} model of {{capacity}} adjustment in the competitive ocean shipping industry the case of which is almost unique as a flexible response to market signals under operational constraints. While the concept of capacity adjustment is related usually with long-term investment or disinvestment, in the past shipping firms have responded extensively to the cyclicality of the market; a common medium-term solution has been the <b>laying-up</b> of ships. Although not without cost, lay-up allows minimization of losses without conceding assets in an unfavorable market for capital goods which {{is the case with}} ships during periods of shipping crises. We validate the hypothesized dependence of changes in the lay-up rates for ships on the speed of mean-reversion and volatility of freight rates on the basis of tanker market data. The results confirm that, for tankers at least, the lay-up decision is a function of more than the relation of prevailing freight rates to operating expenses levels. The speed of mean reversion is significant as faster mean reversion increases the perceived probability of recovery when the market is at low levels. The results can be considered also as proof of a rational response of firms to the rise in the cost of entry and exit of vessels from a full inactivity state as the case has been in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{composites}} such as cross-woven composites {{possess a}} far more complex structure than the well-studied unidirectional and cross-ply types of composite, since {{the making of the}} textile cross-woven composites involves interlacing of fiber bundles and <b>laying-up</b> of fabric laminates. It is of great importance to understand the influence of the complex structures on the mechanical response in cross-woven composites in terms of damage and damage development. In the present study, the microstructure of a cross-woven C/SiC ceramic composite was characterized. The damage and fracture of the composite subject to tension, compression and cyclic tension were investigated. Due to the weaving of the carbon fiber bundles, the SiC matrix was found to be distributed inhomogeneously in the fiber bundle. The chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) processing of the composite produced cracked SiC coatings in the composite. Under monotonic tensile loading, the composite showed six modes of damage, which include (1) matrix cracking, (2) transverse bundle cracking, (3) interfacial debonding/sliding, (4) fiber breaking, (5) ply delamination, and (6) bundle splitting. The development of those damage modes, especially matrix crack multiplication, led to a largely nonlinear stress-strain behavior and caused the composite modulus to decrease substantially during tensile loading. Associated with those damage modes and the complex composite structures, four types of bundle fracture surfaces were found in monotonic tensile loading. The damage modes in cyclic loading (pulsating tension) were similar to those in monotonic tension except that an additional wear mechanism of damage, produced by cycling, was identified in the internal structure of the composite. Under repeated tensile loading, those fatigue damage modes developed in a subtle manner, leading to gradual increase in cyclic elapsed strain and decrease in composite modulus. Fatigue failure of the composite occurred at high fatigue stress levels where continued fiber fracture took place in the composite. This study clearly demonstrated that the architecture and the microstructure of the composite {{have a profound effect on}} the damage and fracture mechanisms under the loading conditions performed in this study. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{system for}} the {{preparation}} of sterilized instruments with unidirectional horizontal air flow (UDHF) has several advantages over a unidirectional down flow system (UDDF). The advantages {{are based on the}} installation of the system being more flexible and easier to use, no cooling of the air flow being necessary and less air being needed for circulation, resulting in reduced energy use. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether a system with UDHF performs equal or superior to a system with UDDF in terms of prevention of contamination of the air (the presence of particles and micro-organisms) during the <b>laying-up</b> process. Methods: The degree of protection (DP) offered by two UDHF system variants and two UDDF system variants was determined for several static set-ups and a dynamic simulation of the process. In addition to determining the level of protection for several categories of particle size, colony-forming units (CFU) were also measured during process simulations. Findings: When maximum protection (no particles present) is considered, the UDHF systems performed significantly better than the UDDF systems for particles >= 2. 5 mu m. When particles were present, there was no significant difference between systems for particles >= 0. 3 and >= 0. 5 mu m. However, the performance of the UDHF system was superior to that of the UDDF system (DP) for particles >= 1. 0 mu m representing the bacteria-carrying particles. During the process measurements, no CFU were found with the UDDF system in 64 % of the measurements, compared with 90 % for the UDHF system (P = 0. 012). Conclusions: The UDHF system offers equal or superior protection to the UDDF system against contamination of the clean area within which the laying up takes place. Despite our finding that the differences did not always reach statistical significance (due to low background concentrations), there is a clear trend, from the small-sized particles (>= 1. 0 mu m) up to the largest sizes considered, including bacteria-carrying particles, that demonstrates the superiority of the horizontal flow system. The UDHF system offers a more robust solution than the UDDF system, provided that good work instructions are given and the height of the table and height of the plenum are properly adjusted.
