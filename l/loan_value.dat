40|$|Using {{a sample}} of banks, this study {{examines}} the capital market pricing implications of three components of <b>loan</b> fair <b>values.</b> We find that the nondiscretionary component is priced on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the discretionary component is assigned a significantly larger multiple than the nondiscretionary component and the noise component is not priced. This implies that the relevance and reliability of <b>loan</b> fair <b>values</b> differs across the three components. The larger multiple assigned to the discretionary component is predicted by a signaling motivation for discretionary behavior, {{consistent with the findings}} for allowance for loan losses.
