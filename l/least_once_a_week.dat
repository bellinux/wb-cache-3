40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} a {{condition}} due to reflux of stomach content in the esophagus causing trouble symptoms or complications or both. GERD is a clinical diagnosis and typically presents with a heartburn and/or regurgitation and a positive response to antacid secretory medications. GERD is the leading outpatient diagnosis among all gastrointestinal disorders in the United States. Approximately 40 % of population report occasional symptoms of GERD whereas 10 - 20 % of patients will have symptoms at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Recent guidelines from gastrointestinal societies such as American College of Gastroenterology, American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and American College of Physicians have laid out specific indications regarding role of esophagogastroduodenoscopy in GERD. Despite these recommendations, studies have revealed that one-fifth to two-fifth EGDs may not be clinically indicated, especially where open access endoscopy referral system is used. Traditionally, GERD has been {{thought to be a}} disease of the western world. Prevalence rates had been estimated to be lower in Asia when compared to that of the Western Countries. Few recent epidemiological studies in India showed the prevalence of reflux disease in India to be between 8 - 24 %, which is comparable to the western world. The use of EGDs becomes more critical for developing countries such as India where prevalence of GERD and BE is comparable to the western countries but have limited resources. In addition to direct cost for an EGD, it burdens economy with indirect costs such as time off from the work, transportation and any procedural complications. Risk stratifying patients with GERD may therefore prevent unnecessary procedures, harms and costs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the existing evidence on the role of endoscopy in GERD...|$|R

We analyzed the relation between diet diversity and the risk of laryngeal cancer using data from a case-control study carried out between 1992 and 2000 in Italy and Switzerland. The subjects of the study were 527 patients with histologically confirmed incident cancers of the larynx and 1297 patients admitted for acute, non-neoplastic diseases, unrelated to tobacco or alcohol consumption. Total diversity was computed {{as the number}} of different foods (overall and within four food groups, i. e., vegetables, fruit, meat, and cereals) consumed at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> per <b>week.</b> <b>A</b> significant inverse association was observed for vegetable diversity (OR= 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 28 - 0. 59, for the highest versus the lowest quartile) and fruit diversity (OR= 0. 40, 95 % CI: 0. 27 - 0. 59).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} sexual harassment among Italian university students and analyze the relationship between harassment and disordered eating behaviors. An observational survey was conducted among university students at Trieste University (Italy) in spring 2014. Students answered an anonymous self-administered questionnaire about sexual harassment, including three domains—sexual harassment, unwanted comments on physical appearance, cyber-harassment—and disordered eating behaviors. The global sexual harassment index was computed with three levels: Level 0, no harassment; Level 1, harassment in at least one of the three domains; and Level 2, harassment in two or three domains. Disordered eating behaviors were classified by at least one of the following: (a) eating without being able to stop or vomiting at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> or twice <b>a</b> month, (b) using laxatives or diuretics at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> or twice <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> (c) monitoring weight every day, and (d) dieting at least very often. The sample included 759 students (347 men and 412 women; 18 - 29 years old). Experiencing sexual harassment was related to eating disorder symptoms for both genders with a regular gradient: the higher the harassment score, the more frequent the disordered eating behavior symptoms, even after adjusting for age and previous sexual violence. The association was stronger for males than females. Sexual harassment and disordered eating behaviors have long been considered mainly a female problem.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between perceived neighborhood environment and physical activity (PA) in high school students from Curitiba (PR), Brazil. METHODS: A sample of 1, 611 high school students from public schools was surveyed. The PA was assessed through questions, engaged for at least 20 minutes or 60 minutes. Perceptions on neighborhood environment were assessed through ten questions about neighborhood characteristics. Gender, age and number of cars in the household were self-reported and used as confounding variables. Absolute and relative frequencies {{were used in the}} sample, and associations were tested through adjusted logistic regressions for the confounding variables and stratified by gender (p < 0. 05). RESULTS: The adjusted analyses showed that the variables "interesting things" among girls (OR = 1. 77; 95 %CI 1. 05 - 2. 96) and "there are places I like" (OR = 2. 18; 95 %CI 1. 33 - 3. 58) and "I see people my age", among boys, were associated with PA of at <b>least</b> 20 minutes/day <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Additionally, among boys, "I see people my age" was associated with 60 -minute (OR = 1. 68; 95 %CI 1. 15 - 2. 45). Perceiving the neighborhood environment as "very good" was associated with higher chances of taking up PA among girls (OR = 1. 92; 95 %CI 1. 15 - 3. 22) and boys (OR = 3. 13; 95 %CI 1. 97 - 4. 97). CONCLUSION: A positive perception of the environment was associated to PA practice among boys and girls in this sample.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examines}} exposure to perceived discrimination and {{its association with}} depression among low-income, Latina male-to-female transgender {{women as well as}} evaluates the impact of sexual partner violence and mistreatment on depression. Methods A total of 220 Latina male-to-female transgender women who resided in Los Angeles, California, were recruited through community based organizations and referrals. Participants completed individual interviews using a structured questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9). Perceived discrimination was assessed using a fifteen-item measure that was designed to assess the experiences of maltreatment of transgender individuals. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between perceived discrimination and depression after controlling for the presence of other variables. Results Of the sample, 35 % reported significant depressive symptoms (PHQ- 9 [*]≥[*] 15). Additionally, one-third of the participants indicated that in the two weeks prior to the interviews they had thought either of hurting themselves or that they would be better off dead. The extent of perceived discrimination in this population was extensive. Many of the participants experienced discrimination on a daily basis (14 %) or at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> or twice <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (25 %) as demonstrated by a positive response to at least 7 of 15 items in the measure of perceived discrimination. Almost six out of ten participants admitted that they had been victims of sexual partner violence. Those who reported more frequent discrimination {{were more likely to be}} identified with severe depression. There was also a notable association between self-reported history of sexual partner violence and depression severity. Conclusions A significant association between depression severity and perceived discrimination was identified. How exposure to discrimination leads to increased risk of mental health problems needs additional investigation. Models investigating the association between perceived discrimination and depression among transgender women should include sexual partner violence as a potential confounding variable. </p...|$|R

25|$|Prayer {{is fairly}} {{prevalent}} in the United States. About 75% of the United States reports praying at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized factor analysis to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka’s first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).|$|E

This cuisine style was first seen in Nagasaki, which served as the point of contact between Europe and Japan at that point in time. Food items such as potatoes, corn, dairy products, as well as the hard candy kompeito (金平糖), spread during this time.

They despised the roads, and took {{their way across the}} fields; and yet, from their appearance, it did not seem as if they cared much where they walked so long as the way did not actually trip them up. When they left the Vicarage, they had begun an argument which swung their feet along so rhythmically in time with it that they covered the ground at over four miles an hour, and saw nothing of the hedgerows, the swelling plowland, or the mild blue sky. What they saw were the Houses of Parliament and the Government Offices in Whitehall. They both belonged to the class which is conscious of having lost its birthright in these great structures and is seeking to build another kind of lodging for its own notion of law and government. Purposely, perhaps, Mary did not agree with Ralph; she loved to feel her mind in conflict with his, and to be certain that he spared her female judgment no ounce of his male muscularity. He seemed to argue as fiercely with {{her as if she were}} his brother. They were alike, however, in believing that it behooved them to take in hand the repair and reconstruction of the fabric of England. They agreed in thinking that nature has not been generous in the endowment of our councilors.

At length they drew breath, let the argument fly away into the limbo of other good arguments, and, leaning over a gate, opened their eyes for the first time and looked about them. Their feet tingled with warm blood and their breath rose in steam around them. The bodily exercise made them both feel more direct and less self-conscious than usual, and Mary, indeed, was overcome by a sort of light-headedness which made it seem to her that it mattered very little what happened next.
