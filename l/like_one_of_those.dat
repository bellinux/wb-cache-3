The Guardians Caroline Sullivan argued that although [...] "others lend a hand [...] it's very much Stefani's show"; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of PopMatters compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester felt that {{the large number of}} collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani's identity on the album. Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to {{be all things to all}} people here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived."

Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there."

It feels <b>like</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.|$|E

He also said the idea was unoriginal and compared it to Spears' fragances commercials. [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun said, [...] "forget PVC catsuits and teeny weeny air hostess outfits. Britney Spears has gone all sophisticated on us" [...] and positively commented on the fashion, saying [...] "Britney dons a hat more suited to Ascot than a music video". Peter Gicas of E! commented that the video was a nice departure from her recent more choreographed videos, such as [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "If U Seek Amy". He commended it for its [...] "more straightforward approach in telling a so-called story", but felt it was [...] "a bit too much <b>like</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> overly dramatic fragrance commercials".

[...] Robert Hanks from The Independent in the UK writes that [...] "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights" [...] with [...] "Hush". Noel Murray in The A.V. Club calls it an [...] "episode unlike any other, with a lusher score {{and some of the}} most genuinely disturbing imagery I've yet seen on Buffy." [...] The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it [...] "scans just <b>like</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> listless dreams in which you try to scream, and can't.

500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit <b>like</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E

[...] Handlen argued that King was a wrong fit for The X-Files and that the resultant script was King [...] "being asked to marry his voice to Carter's". He derided the plot and wrote that it was written [...] "like someone (Darin Morgan, only not funny at all) doing a parody for the most familiar King tropes." [...] Handlen, however, did praise the violence in the episode, noting that he is [...] "a sucker for gore", but ultimately called the episode [...] "lousy". John Keegan from Critical Myth heavily criticized the episode's writing and gave it a 4 out of 10. he wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is quite a disappointment, considering that Stephen King would appear to be an obvious match for a series like this. Unfortunately, the final script doesn’t seem to be a true horror story or the whimsical character study that it clearly wants to be, and so it fails to satisfy on either account. There are some great character moments, but it’s not enough to save the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked {{a turning point}} in his career. The {{screenplay}} originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him {{in front of the class}} and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the [...] "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it [...] "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought [...] "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" [...] to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as [...] "dreamlike": [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" [...] He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.|$|E
