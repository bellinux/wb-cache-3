5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. <b>Lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide,</b> and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of lead in}} {{methanesulfonic acid}} solution {{in the presence of}} a MnO 2 air cathode in a primary lead-air cell is investigated. The highest power density of the lead-air cell is 2. 8 mW cm- 2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction results demonstrate the formation of lead (II) oxide and <b>lead</b> (IV) <b>dioxide</b> on the air cathode after continuous discharge. Field emission scanning electron microscopy image shows that the surface coverage of lead (II) oxide and <b>lead</b> (IV) <b>dioxide</b> on the air cathode is only partial and will allow oxygen reduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use {{of colored}} {{semiconductor}} oxide like <b>lead</b> (IV) <b>dioxide</b> and mercury (II) oxide as photocatalysts in photocatalytic bleaching of rose bengal {{was investigated in}} detail. In order to harness solar energy, the effective wavelength of the photocatalyst is to be expanded into the visible region and that increases the rate of photocatalytic bleaching of the dye. Progress of the reaction was recorded spectrophotometrically. The comparative study of photocatalytic activity of <b>lead</b> (IV) <b>dioxide</b> and mercury (II) oxide was made using photocatalytic bleaching of rose bengal as model system. The effect of various parameters like concentration of dye, pH, amount of semiconductor, light intensity etc. on the rate of photocatalytic bleaching of the dye was also observed. On the basis of rate of the reaction (rate constant) the order of photocatalytic activities of the semiconductor oxides {{was found to be}} PbO 2 > HgO. A tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic bleaching of rose bengal has also been proposed...|$|R
50|$|Good {{air quality}} {{is vital for}} the refuge to {{maintain}} itself. A few problems dealing with air pollution are carbon monoxide, <b>lead,</b> nitrogen <b>dioxide,</b> ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. The primary producers of these pollutants are vehicle emissions, power plants, and industrial activities. The Indian River Lagoon area {{is said to have}} good air quality. Sometimes occasional temperate increases can temporarily degrade the air quality below the accepted levels.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
25|$|Up to this point, all {{existing}} batteries {{would be}} permanently drained when all their chemical reactions were spent. In 1859, Gaston Planté invented the lead–acid battery, the first-ever battery {{that could be}} recharged by passing a reverse current through it. A lead acid cell consists of a lead anode and a <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> cathode immersed in sulfuric acid. Both electrodes react with the acid to produce lead sulfate, but the reaction at the lead anode releases electrons whilst the reaction at the <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> consumes them, thus producing a current. These chemical reactions can be reversed by passing a reverse current through the battery, thereby recharging it.|$|E
25|$|Lead acid {{cells can}} easily be {{manufactured}} at home, but a tedious charge/discharge cycle is needed to 'form' the plates. This is {{a process in which}} lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted to <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> (positive plate) and pure lead (negative plate). Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, increasing the surface area, increasing the current the cell can deliver.|$|E

50|$|Hydrazones are {{oxidized}} (dehydrogenation) {{for example}} with silver oxide or mercury oxide {{for example the}} synthesis of 2-diazopropane from acetone hydrazone. Other oxidizing reagents are <b>lead</b> tetraacetate, manganese <b>dioxide</b> and the Swern reagent. Tosylhydrazones RRC=N-NHTs are reacted with base for example triethylamine in the synthesis of crotyl diazoacetate and in the synthesis of phenyldiazomethane from PhCHNHTs and sodium methoxide.|$|R
5000|$|Magnitogorsk was {{mentioned}} in the Blacksmith Institute's 2007 survey of the world's worst polluted cities, placed in the report's unranked list of the 25 most polluted places outside the top ten. Pollutants include <b>lead,</b> sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> heavy metals and other air pollutants. According to the local hospital, only 1% of all children {{living in the city}} are in good health. The Blacksmith Institute says that, according to a local newspaper report, [...] "only 28% of infants born in 1992 were healthy, and only 27% had healthy mothers". However, according to Blacksmith Institute, plant managers have upgraded much of their equipment in recent years and emissions have been reduced by about 60%.|$|R
25|$|In most EOG methods, the {{hydrogen}} gas {{will be removed}} to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable {{because of the high}} overpotential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> or boron-doped diamond.|$|E
500|$|Polonium also occurs {{naturally}} in various ores, and the <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> residues from the refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, left over after {{the removal of}} uranium and radium from the natural ore were known to contain polonium.

500|$|A second method {{attempted}} was a kiln process. The {{idea was}} to simply roast the <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> and vaporize the polonium.

So lead orthophosphate was tried, which slagged at [...] This was made by mixing the <b>lead</b> <b>dioxide</b> with phosphoric acid. Experiments showed that the polonium vaporized well when the lead orthophosphate was heated to [...] for four hours. Unfortunately, the process then ran into problems with dust and other foreign matter, and with contamination of the personnel and equipment involved.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen is industrially {{produced}} from steam reforming, which uses fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, or coal. The energy {{content of the}} produced hydrogen {{is less than the}} energy content of the original fuel, some of it being lost as excessive heat during production. Steam reforming <b>leads</b> to carbon <b>dioxide</b> emissions, {{in the same way as}} a car engine would do.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} minor actinide (MA) transmutation property was performed for various fast reactor core concepts. The differences of MA transmutation property were classified by the variations of fuel type (oxide, nitride, metal), coolant type (sodium, <b>lead,</b> carbon <b>dioxide)</b> and design philosophy. Both nitride and metal fuels bring about 10 % larger MA transmutation amount compared with oxide fuel. The MA transmutation amount is almost unchanged by {{the difference between}} sodium and lead coolants, while carbon dioxide causes a reduction by about 10 % compared with those. The changes of MA transmutation property by fuel and coolant types are comparatively small. The effects caused by the difference of core design are rather significant. 522 1...|$|R

25|$|Cairo is an {{expanding}} city, {{which has led}} to many environmental problems. The air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of <b>lead,</b> carbon <b>dioxide,</b> sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.|$|R
