5|$|By late {{afternoon}} of 19 August, Canadian and Polish forces had {{linked with the}} US 80th Division and 90th Division already stationed in the town. The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model′s forces. As the <b>linkup</b> occurred, Model′s II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have to defend against two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower took direct {{command of}} all Allied ground forces on 1 September. Concerned about German counter-attacks {{and the limited}} {{materiel}} arriving in France, he decided to continue operations on a broad front rather than attempting narrow thrusts. The <b>linkup</b> of the Normandy forces with the Allied forces in southern France occurred on 12 September {{as part of the}} drive to the Siegfried Line. On 17 September, Montgomery launched Operation Market Garden, an unsuccessful attempt by Anglo-American airborne troops to capture bridges in the Netherlands to allow ground forces to cross the Rhine into Germany. The Allied advance slowed due to German resistance and the lack of supplies (especially fuel). On 16 December the Germans launched the Ardennes Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Bulge, their last major offensive of the war on the Western Front. A series of successful Soviet actions began with the Vistula–Oder Offensive on 12 January. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April as Soviet troops neared his Führerbunker in Berlin, and Germany surrendered on 7 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the Metro {{started in}} 1992 {{as part of}} the {{redevelopment}} plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996, and stage 1, from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken, opened in 2002. Stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, opened in 2003, followed by stage 3, from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen, in 2007. Construction of the M3+M4 City Circle Line is underway. Scheduled to open in 2019, this line will form a circle around the city center, be entirely underground and not share any track with M1 and M2. Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg will serve as interchanges between M1, M2 and M3+M4. A two-station branch towards Nordhavn is planned to open in 2019. A planned expansion towards Sydhavn will include a <b>linkup</b> with Ny Ellebjerg on the S-train network (2023). These stations will also be connected to the regional train network following the completion of the new Copenhagen-Ringsted railway. The Sydhavn extension has been approved.|$|E

5|$|Though the German {{advance in}} the south was slower than planned, it was faster than the Soviets expected. On 9 July, the first German units reached the Psel River. The next day, the first German {{infantry}} crossed the river. Despite the deep defensive system and minefields, German tank losses remained lower than the Soviet's. At this point, Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps away from Oboyan to attack toward the northeast {{in the direction of}} Prokhorovka. The main concern of Manstein and Hausser was the inability of Army Detachment Kempf to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps. On 11 July, Army Detachment Kempf finally achieved a breakthrough. In a surprise night attack, the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets. Once across, Breith made every effort to push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south. A <b>linkup</b> with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled.|$|E
5|$|Within the 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) was tasked with advancing north through the Western Slavonia region, from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica, {{and with a}} secondary drive from Okučani towards Kutina. This task was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by {{the main thrust of}} the JNA advancing from the Eastern Slavonia in about a week. The <b>linkup</b> was designed to facilitate a further advance west to Zagreb and Varaždin. The Corps had already deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani to support the advance that started on 21 September, and reached the Papuk Mountains. The corps received two motorised and one artillery brigades as reinforcements during the advance, but the problems with morale and desertions experienced by the JNA elsewhere were also present in the Banja Luka Corps.|$|E
5|$|A northwestern {{expansion}} of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped {{as part of the}} City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport. A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the Danish parliament, and is planned to open in 2019. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, but as the only <b>linkup</b> between the M5 and the existing network would be at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4, also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station.|$|E

The crew extended the ring of the orbital docking system in preparation for <b>linkup</b> with the ISS. Commander Charles Hobaugh also installed the docking system's centerline camera that was used during the rendezvous with the station in the docking port. Two Rendezvous burns were performed (NC-2 and NC-3) on the path to reach the station. The NC-2 burn was scheduled for earlier in the day and once again Atlantis' reaction control jets were fired for NC-3 burn later in the day. The NC-3 burn lasted for 12s.|$|E
25|$|A second {{attempt on}} Sinyavino was being {{prepared}} {{to start on}} Oct. 20, but was pre-empted by the German offensive towards Tikhvin on Oct. 16, which intended to encircle 54th Army {{on the way to}} cutting all possible supply routes to Leningrad and linking up with the Finnish Army. In the face of this attack, the army, which had the bulk of the Soviet forces between Lake Ladoga and Lake Ilmen, was ordered to transfer the 4th Guards and 310th Rifle Divisions to 4th Army on Oct. 23. By Nov. 8, the entire German offensive had ground to a halt, due to Soviet resistance and the winter weather. 54th Army had not been encircled, and while Tikhvin had been taken, there had been no <b>linkup</b> with the Finns, and Army Group North was vastly over-extended. A new directive from Hitler ordered yet another attack on the army at Volkhov, but a desperate counterattack by 310th Rifle Division stopped the 8th Panzer Division east of the town.|$|E

50|$|Acting coaches may be freelancers who {{are hired}} for an hourly or daily rate, {{or they may}} be hired on a longer-term basis by a film studio, {{production}} company or theatre company. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top Hollywood celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over Skype or other video <b>linkups.</b> Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.|$|R
25|$|At his {{afternoon}} situation {{conference on}} April 22, Hitler {{fell into a}} tearful rage when he realised that his plans of the day before {{were not going to}} be implemented. He declared that the war was lost, blamed the generals and announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then kill himself. In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, the Chief of Staff of the OKW, General Alfred Jodl, speculated that the Twelfth Army, which was facing the American forces, could move to Berlin because the Americans already on the Elbe River were unlikely to move further east. Hitler immediately seized upon the idea and within hours, the army's commander, General Walther Wenck, was ordered to disengage from the American forces and move the Twelfth Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the Ninth Army moved west, it could link up with the Twelfth Army. In the evening, Heinrici was given permission to make the <b>linkup.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{coordination}} with a southern offensive by Nationalist Chinese forces under General Wei Li-huang, Allied troops under Stilwell's command launched the long-awaited invasion of northern Burma; after heavy fighting and casualties, the two forces linked up in January 1945. Stilwell's strategy remained unchanged: opening a new ground supply route from India to China {{would allow the}} Allies to equip and train new Chinese army divisions for use against the Japanese. The new road network, later called the Ledo Road, would link {{the northern end of}} the Burma Road as the primary supply route to China; Stilwell's staff planners had estimated the route would supply 65,000 tons of supplies per month. Using these figures, Stilwell argued that the Ledo Road network would greatly surpass the tonnage being airlifted over the Hump. General Chennault doubted that such an extended network of trails through difficult jungle could ever match the tonnage that could be delivered with modern cargo transport aircraft then deploying in-theater. Progress on the Ledo Road was slow, and could not be completed until the <b>linkup</b> of forces in January 1945.|$|E

40|$|Asian efforts towards {{bond market}} {{development}} {{are driven by}} the 1997 - 98 financial crises; Central and Eastern European efforts by the transition towards EMU.

50|$|These {{projects}} {{are in many}} senses an evolution of amateur radio, and more specifically packet radio, {{as well as an}} outgrowth of the free software community (which in itself substantially overlaps with amateur radio). The key to using standard wireless networking devices designed for short-range use for multi-kilometre Long Range Wi-Fi <b>linkups</b> is the use of high-gain directional antennas. Rather than purchasing commercially available units, such groups sometimes advocate homebuilt antenna construction. Examples include the cantenna, which is typically constructed from a Pringles potato chip can, and RONJA, an optical link that can be made from a smoke flue and LEDs, with circuitry and instructions released under the GFDL. As with other wireless mesh networks, three distinct generations of mesh networks are used in wireless community networks.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SME) in cooperating with other businesses of their size shows that SME have difficulties in coping with current demands on manufacturing enterprises in Germany. Their co-operation efforts take shape as company associations, co-operation <b>linkups</b> or as company networks. By collaborating in networks SMEs are not only able to achieve the same market power and economies of scale as large companies, they also maintain the typical flexibility and speed of response of a small enterprise along with its proximity to customers. This kind of agility and dynamics can only be accomplished through process and employee oriented manufacturing structures. To ensure the successful market performance of a manufacturing enterprise it is essential to introduce decentralised, autonomous organisational units which make production more transformable and adaptable.

40|$|Web {{communities}} in general grow naturally, thus creating unbalanced network structures {{where a few}} domains centralise most of the <b>linkups.</b> When one of them breaks down, {{a significant part of}} the community might be unable to communicate with the remaining domains. Such a situation is highly inconvenient, as in the case of wishing to pursue distribution policies within the community, or for marketing purposes. In order to reduce the damages of such an occurrence, the Web community should be reconfigured, in such a way that a complete sub-network of main domains – the hubs- is identified and that each of the other domains of the community – the spokes – is doubly linked at least with a hub. This problem can be modellised through a bi-objective optimisation problem, the Web Community Reconfiguring Problem, which will be presented in this paper. A bi-objective mixed binary formulation will also be shown, along with a brief description of GRASP, tabu search and hybrid heuristics which were developed to find feasible solutions to the problem, possibly efficient solutions to the bi-objective problem. A computational experiment is reported, involving comparison of these metaheuristics when applied to several Web communities, obtained by crawling the Web and using epistemic boundaries and to other randomly generated ones.

Arriving in Sarajevo, he decided to stay with the Sarajevans, inspired by the way they tried to maintain the life they had before the siege began. He saw Sarajevo as key because Sarajevans refused to be divided along ethnic lines with many Serbs joining the defence of the city against the Serb nationalist besiegers. Carter began to do some work for the Sarajevan television, and he managed to get an interview with Bono from rock group U2. Bono, who later admitted that he was deeply touched by Bill Carter's story, heard about the importance of pop music in Sarajevo and said that he would love to play in Sarajevo. Carter quickly concluded that this was too dangerous — not least because the large gathering of fans that would assemble might be shelled by the besieging Serb nationalists. Instead, Carter came up with another way of connecting rock music with Sarajevans; instead of [...] "bringing U2 to Sarajevo" [...] he would [...] "bring Sarajevo to U2", by means of satellite <b>linkups</b> to U2's Zoo TV Tour concerts, giving the people of Sarajevo a chance to tell their story to the world.|$|R
