40|$|Palmitic and <b>lauric</b> <b>acids</b> and serum {{cholesterol}} Dear Sir: A recent {{paper by}} Denke and Grundy (l) concludes that pal-mitic and <b>lauric</b> <b>acids</b> raise serum cholesterol. The {{data do not}} support this conclusion. This paper compares concentrations of serum cholesterol achieved by subjects on liquid diets high in <b>lauric</b> or palmitic <b>acid</b> with the results for subjects on a control diet high in oleic acid. The experimental protocol does not allow conclusions to be drawn concerning {{the effect of these}} fatty acids on serum cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol-lowering oleic acid in the diets high in <b>lauric</b> or palmitic <b>acids</b> are almost half those in the control diet. The amount ofthe cholesterol-raising myristic acid in the palmitic acid diet is iO times the amount in the control diet. Is it a surprise that the experimental mixtures induce higher concentrations of serum cholesterol than did the control diet? The authors violated a basic tenet of research: the experi-mental and control should differ by only one variable. It is most disturbing that the authors did not give the serum concentrations ofcholesterol while the subjects were on a normal diet. These values would have provided a good baseline. Surely they obtained these values. Why did they conceal them? Any scientific paper should include references to results that contra-dict the author's contention. Denke and Grundy ignore papers that appear to show that palmitic acid does not affect serum cholesterol concentrations. Finally, the data is of poor quality.

Habitual energy and macronutrient intakes were quantified from 2 d diet records, and BMI was calculated from height and weight. Subjects also completed a fat ranking task using custard containing varying amounts (0, 2, 6 and 10 %) of fat.

The determination of fatty acids was done using a simple and mild method that utilized different solvent extractions ranging from nonpolar to polar solvents (hexane, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively), and the samples were powdered with and without liquid nitrogen.
