Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour.

At Washington and Lee, Wolfe {{was a member of}} the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity. Wolfe majored in English and practiced his writing outside the classroom as well. He was the sports editor of the college newspaper and helped found a literary magazine, Shenandoah. Of particular influence was his professor Marshall Fishwick, a teacher of American studies educated at Yale. More in the tradition of anthropology than literary scholarship, Fishwick taught his classes to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of a culture, including those elements considered profane. Wolfe's undergraduate thesis, entitled [...] "A Zoo Full of Zebras: Anti-Intellectualism in America," [...] evinced his fondness for words and aspirations toward cultural criticism.

2500|$|The Ximenez-Fatio House {{has been}} the site of more than 15 archaeological digs — {{more than any other}} {{property}} in St. Augustine, according to St. Augustine City Archaeologist Carl Halbirt. Archaeologists including Dr. Charles Fairbanks, Dr. Kathleen Deagan and others have found evidence of human occupation on the property dating back to the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. A sub-surface sampling survey of the city conducted by Dr. Deagan in 1976 placed the Ximenez-Fatio lot at the approximate center of the 16th century Spanish settlement. In 2015, she observed that the property continues to invite exploration — in part because, [...] "there is occupation going back to the founding of St. Augustine, and so it's possible to really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> spectrum of the city's occupation." [...] According to Halbirt and Deagan, the high-ground position of the site — and artifacts discovered there — suggest that the property was inhabited by St. Augustine's upper class {{from the beginning of the}} colonial period and that there was continual activity in the centuries that followed.|$|E

It is idle to dispute the general positions of criticism, and there is no useful gainsaying its judgment that French literature is a major literature and Italian a minor literature in this century; but whether this verdict will stand for all time, there may be a reasonable doubt. Criterions may change, and hereafter people may <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair so differently that a literature which went to the making of a people will not be accounted a minor literature, but will take its place with the great literary movements.|$|E

6000|$|The second {{finding of}} censure {{was that the}} Irish members incited to {{intimidation}} by speeches, knowing that intimidation led to crime. The third was that they never placed themselves {{on the side of}} law and order; they did not assist the administration, and did not denounce the party of physical force. As if this, said Mr. Gladstone, had not been the subject of incessant discussion and denunciation in parliament at the time ten years ago, and yet no vote of condemnation was passed upon the Irish members then. On the contrary, the tory party, knowing all these charges, associated with them for purposes of votes and divisions; climbed into office on Mr. Parnell’s shoulders; and through the viceroy with the concurrence of the prime minister, took Mr. Parnell into counsel upon the devising of a plan for Irish government. Was parliament now to affirm and record a finding that it had scrupulously abstained from ever making its own, and without regard to the counter-allegation that more crime and worse crime was prevented by agitation? It was the duty of parliament to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the facts of the great crisis of 1880-1—to the distress, to the rejection of the Compensation bill, to the growth of evictions, to the prevalence of excessive rents.

I hear no challenges upon that statement, for I think it is generally and deeply felt that without the agitation the Land Act would not have been passed. As the man responsible more than any other for the Act of 1881—as the man whose duty it was to consider that question day and night during nearly the whole of that session—I must record my firm opinion that it would not have become the law of the land, {{if it had not been}} for the agitation with which Irish society was convulsed.”(257) ...|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt as}} long as man and all other animals are viewed as {{independent}} creations, an effectual stop is put to our natural desire to investigate {{as far as possible}} the causes of Expression. By this doctrine, anything and everything can be equally well explained; and it has proved as pernicious with respect to Expression as to every other branch of natural history. With mankind some expressions, such as the bristling of the hair under the influence of extreme terror, or the uncovering of the teeth under that of furious rage, can hardly be understood, except on the belief that man once existed in a much lower and animal-like condition. The community of certain expressions in distinct though allied species, as in the movements of the same facial muscles during laughter by man and by various monkeys, is rendered somewhat more intelligible, if we believe in their descent from a common progenitor.
