5|$|Dickov's <b>Leicester</b> debut {{came in a}} 3–0 defeat against Derby County. His first {{goals for}} <b>Leicester</b> came in his sixth appearance, when he scored both <b>Leicester</b> goals in a 2–1 victory against Blackburn Rovers, the club's first win for four months. However, Dickov only scored two more goals that season. <b>Leicester</b> {{finished}} bottom and were relegated.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{was born}} in <b>Leicester,</b> Leicestershire to a family of Antiguan descent, and his father, Tyrone Heskey, ran the {{security}} of nightclubs in <b>Leicester.</b> He attended City of <b>Leicester</b> School, Evington.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leicester's</b> {{halls of}} {{residence}} are noteworthy: many of the halls (nearly all located in Oadby) date from the early 1900s and were the homes of <b>Leicester’s</b> wealthy industrialists.|$|R
50|$|At first, he was {{a regular}} in <b>Leicester's</b> first team line up, but after two seasons, he {{was little more than}} a squad player, only {{appearing}} in half of <b>Leicester's</b> games in the 1977-78 season.|$|R
50|$|Dominance-subordination {{relationships}} {{can vary}} markedly between breeds {{of the same}} species. Studies on Merinos and Border <b>Leicesters</b> revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border <b>Leicesters</b> when a competitive feeding situation was created.|$|R
5|$|<b>Leicester</b> City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay {{to overcome their}} Third Division opponents 2–1. The first <b>Leicester</b> goal was controversial, as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged for a foul. Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but <b>Leicester</b> quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second half}} <b>Leicester</b> claimed a third goal, but the referee adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E
5|$|The project {{gained the}} backing of several key partners—Leicester City Council, <b>Leicester</b> Promotions (responsible for tourist marketing), the University of <b>Leicester,</b> <b>Leicester</b> Cathedral, Darlow Smithson Productions (responsible for the planned TV show) and the Richard III Society. Funding for the initial phase of pre-excavation {{research}} came from the Richard III Society's bursary fund {{and members of the}} Looking for Richard project, with <b>Leicester</b> Promotions agreeing to pick up the £35,000 cost of the dig. The University of <b>Leicester</b> Archaeological Services—an independent body with offices at the university—was appointed as the project's archaeological contractor.|$|E
5|$|An {{initial bid}} from his former club <b>Leicester</b> City was {{rejected}} a week earlier, and after pondering other offers from Toronto FC and Blackpool, Dickov decided to rejoin <b>Leicester</b> on 7 August 2008, signing a two-year contract. He made his debut in a 2–0 home win over Milton Keynes Dons on 9 August 2008, scoring his first goal in a 3–2 League Cup defeat to Fulham on 27 August. He made {{a total of}} 20 league games, scoring two goals as <b>Leicester</b> finished the 2008–09 season as League One champions. On 28 August 2009, Dickov joined Derby County on loan until January as cover. Due to an injury crisis Dickov found himself playing regularly at Derby, where his dogged style won over {{the support of the}} Derby fans. Dickov scored his first goal for Derby against Queens Park Rangers on 24 October 2009. After his loan spell at Derby ended, Dickov returned to <b>Leicester</b> in January 2010. He was released from his contract by <b>Leicester</b> on 1 February 2010 to find a new club.|$|E
60|$|<b>Leicester's</b> {{had drawn}} against Jephson's {{in the second}} round. Norris's lot had beaten Cooke's by, curiously enough, {{almost exactly the same}} margin as that by which <b>Leicester's</b> had {{defeated}} Webster's. It was generally considered that this match would decide <b>Leicester's</b> chances for the cup. If they could beat a really hot team like Jephson's, it was reasonable to suppose that they would do the same {{to the rest of the}} Houses, though the School House would have to be reckoned with. But the School House, as Pringle had observed, was weak in the field. It was not a coherent team. Individually its members were good, but they did not play together as <b>Leicester's</b> did.|$|R

5|$|Brian Little {{took over}} in 1991 {{and by the end}} of the 1991–92 season <b>Leicester</b> had reached the playoff final for a place in the new FA Premier League, but lost to Blackburn Rovers and a penalty from former <b>Leicester</b> striker Mike Newell. The club also reached the playoff final the {{following}} year, losing 4–3 to Swindon Town, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as <b>Leicester</b> manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save <b>Leicester</b> from finishing second from bottom in the 1994–95 season.|$|E
5|$|Frank McLintock, a noted {{player for}} seven years for <b>Leicester</b> in a {{successful}} period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering <b>Leicester</b> to the Division Two championship in 1980. Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep <b>Leicester</b> in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped <b>Leicester</b> maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later <b>Leicester</b> were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after <b>Leicester</b> went down.|$|E
50|$|He was {{the guest}} of honour at the <b>Leicester's</b> final game at Filbert Street (the club's home for over 110 years) in April 2002 and a suite at <b>Leicester's</b> current home ground The King Power Stadium is named after him in {{recognition}} of his service to the club.|$|R
5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood <b>Leicester's</b> break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on <b>Leicester's</b> chances were shared by Gary Lineker, who said that N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been <b>Leicester's</b> most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|R
50|$|On 8 May 1918, the {{cadre of}} 2/4th Bn was {{transferred}} to 47th Bde of 16th Division, (formerly the Irish Division, also smashed up in the Spring Offensive), which went back to England in June. 2/4th Bn was sent to Aldeburgh, where it was merged into the 14th Bn <b>Leicesters,</b> a newly formed service battalion. The 14th <b>Leicesters</b> then moved to Aldershot, where the 16th Division was reforming as an English division. It returned to France on 30 July and 14th <b>Leicesters</b> served with the 16th Division during the final advance of the war.|$|R

5|$|He {{managed to}} score 13 {{goals in the}} 2003–04 season. <b>Leicester</b> were {{subsequently}} relegated to the First Division and Dickov moved to Blackburn Rovers, declining an offer of an improved contract from <b>Leicester</b> and exercising a contractual clause which allowed him to join a Premier League club for a nominal fee.|$|E
5|$|He {{was buried}} in the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, <b>Leicester,</b> the church which he had built within the {{religious}} and charitable institution founded by his father next to <b>Leicester</b> Castle, and where he had re-buried his father some years previously.|$|E

5|$|Even {{more than}} his debts, the Earl of <b>Leicester's</b> will {{triggered}} litigation. He had intended his illegitimate son from his early 1570s relationship with Douglas Sheffield, the adolescent Robert Dudley, to inherit Kenilworth {{after the death of}} his brother, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Some of the countess' jointure manors lay in the castle's vicinity, while at the same time they had been assigned to the younger Dudley's inheritance by the overseers of <b>Leicester's</b> will. After Warwick's death in February 1590, lengthy legal proceedings ensued over whether particular parts of Lady <b>Leicester's</b> jointure belonged to the Kenilworth estate or not.|$|R
5|$|In 1603 Dudley {{initiated}} {{moves to}} prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and <b>Leicester.</b> If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with <b>Leicester</b> had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles <b>Leicester</b> and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of <b>Leicester</b> testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady <b>Leicester.</b> All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, <b>Leicester</b> were {{promoted}} back to Division One, {{and won the}} Charity Shield for {{the only}} time. Unusually, due to double winners Arsenal's commitments in European competition, Division Two winners <b>Leicester</b> were invited to play FA Cup runners-up Liverpool, beating them 1–0 thanks to a goal by Steve Whitworth. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. <b>Leicester</b> reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1973–74.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Leicester's march up {{the league}} system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, {{combined}} with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed <b>Leicester</b> City to clinch a promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton saw <b>Leicester</b> become the {{champions of the}} 2013–14 Championship, the seventh time they had been champions of England's second tier. On 5 May 2014, 35,000 fans in <b>Leicester</b> lined the streets for a parade in celebration of the team's success.|$|E

5|$|Kisnorbo's {{first goal}} for <b>Leicester</b> came on 15 October 2005 against Watford at Vicarage Road, {{which turned out}} to be the match winner. His initial {{appearances}} for <b>Leicester</b> were as a midfielder, and at first he failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. However, a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo, and his partnership with then-teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping <b>Leicester</b> avoid relegation to League One that season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Leicester</b> Abbey {{was founded}} in 1143 by Robert le Bossu, 2nd Earl of <b>Leicester,</b> and was {{dedicated}} to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It {{was not the first}} abbey Robert had established, having founded Garendon Abbey, also in Leicestershire, in 1133. Robert's father, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of <b>Leicester,</b> had previously founded a college of secular canons in <b>Leicester,</b> known as The College of St Mary de Castro. The new abbey assumed control of the college and its possessions, which included all of the churches in <b>Leicester.</b> Robert added to this with the gift of numerous churches in Leicestershire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. The abbey also gained the manor of Asfordby from its merger with the college, and the manor of Knighton from its founder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Leicester</b> Abbey {{was granted}} in 1539, on a 21-year lease, to Dr. Francis Cave, {{one of the}} commissioners who had {{negotiated}} the surrender of the abbey. During this period the abbey was rapidly demolished with the stone sold to meet the high demand within the town of <b>Leicester.</b>|$|E
