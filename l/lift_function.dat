Our results include improved sequential lifting methods and novel sequence independent lifting methods using multidimensional superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions.</b> ^ First we investigate sequential lifting for general 0 – 1 MIPs. We {{introduce a new}} scheme to obtain strong bounds on sequential <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> for general seed inequalities. This scheme yields a systematic procedure to derive the maximal set of a general seed inequality. This result can significantly reduce the computational burden associated with sequential lifting. ^ Second, we perform a polyhedral study of the 0 – 1 knapsack problem with disjoint cardinality constraints (MCKP). This model generalizes many MIPs with multiple constraints and {{is a first step}} in the study of general unstructured 0 – 1 MIP sets. First, we derive a family of generalized cover inequalities (GCIs) that are strong for a restriction of the problem. We then derive a family of facet-defining inequalities for MCKP by polynomially lifting GCIs. We also characterize their maximal sets. Further, we develop a family of multidimensional superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> of provably high quality to perform sequence independent lifting for GCIs in MCKP. ^ Third, we propose a general framework to construct new high-dimensional superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> using known lower-dimensional ones. This framework is practically significant since it yields a simple procedure to build multidimensional superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions.</b> We illustrate its strength and versatility by building high-dimensional superadditive approximations for two generic MIP sets. The superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> developed in this thesis are the first multidimensional superadditive functions obtained in the literature. ^ Finally, we perform a computational study of cutting planes generated from multidimensional superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> for 0 – 1 mixed integer programs with cardinality and precedence constraints. Our results show that even a small number of cutting planes generated from multiple problem rows often lead to a significant improvement in the solution of 0 – 1 integer programs as compared to state-of-the-art commercial solvers. This observation indicates that cutting planes generated from multiple rows can be effective in the solution of complex MIPs. ...|$|R

In order to compute the mixed volume, a mixed subdivision of the tuple of polytopes is needed, which can be obtained by embedding the polytopes in a higher-dimensional space, i. e., by lifting them.

40|$|Long, thin, {{flexible}} cylindrical {{elements of}} large scale structures are {{heavily influenced by}} the fluid flow around them. Equally, their movement has an appreciable effect on the fluid flow. This two-way interaction leads to complex dynamic behaviour that can cause fatigue and thus reduce operational lifetime. As demand for longer span bridges and drilling in deeper marine environments increases, research into the best modelling practice of this scenario gains importance. The work described in this thesis establishes a suitable method to model in CFD aero/hydro-elastic behaviour of slender cylindrical elements in large scale structures. In order to achieve this outcome, the author has: modelled the drag crisis on a static cylindrical element; developed a suitable FSI coupling program; combined the drag crisis model with the FSI coupling program and validate against published experimental data. The turbulence formulation used was carefully chosen {{taking into account the}} flow features that are important to the onset of the drag crisis. An LES formulation capable of adapting the model constant of the SGS model according to local shear conditions was identied as the best candidate to achieve this aim. The fluid and structural solvers used were loosely coupled by an explicit method that achieved a balance of kinetic energy as well as matching displacement at the moving fluid/solid interface. The integration method and implementation of this coupling strategy was verified by running a test case at low Reynolds number that produced a regular sinusoidal <b>lift</b> <b>function</b> on the cylinder that was kept stationary. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration response produced by the structural solver was compared against a closed solution and found to match with an acceptable level of error. A number of FSI simulations with the cylinder free to move in the cross-flow direction only was carried out. The displacement response was compared against published numerical and experimental data and the importance of having a sufficient spanwise dimension of flow domain was highlighted. Simulations with the cylinder free to move in the along-flow direction aswell as cross-flow direction were carried out. In some simulations where lock-in was observed, the effect of the drag crisis was clearly seen. Energy entered into the system as a result of low drag on the upstream motion of the cylinder caused by the drag crisis. More simulations at different velocities are recommended to define a displacement response curve and make further new observations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

This theory includes a <b>lift</b> deficiency <b>function</b> that is completely analogous to Loewy and Theodorsen.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in mixed integer programming have highlighted {{the need for}} multi-row cuts. To this day, the performance of such cuts has typically fallen short of the single-row Gomory mixed integer cut. This disparity between the theoretical need and the practical shortcomings of multi-row cuts motivates the study of both the mixed integer cut and multi-row cuts. In this thesis, we build on the theoretical foundations of the mixed integer cut and develop techniques to derive multi-row cuts. 	 	The first chapter introduces the mixed integer programming problem. In this chapter, we review the terminology and cover some basic results that find application throughout this thesis. Furthermore, we describe the practical solution of mixed integer programs, and in particular, we discuss the role of cutting planes and our contributions to this theory. 	 	In Chapter 2, we investigate the Gomory mixed integer cut {{from the perspective of}} group polyhedra. In this setting, the mixed integer cut appears as a facet of the master cyclic group polyhedron. Our chief contribution is a characterization of the adjacent facets and the extreme points of the mixed integer cut. This provides insight into the families of cuts that may work well in conjunction with the mixed integer cut. We further provide extensions of these results under mappings between group polyhedra. 	 	For the remainder of this thesis we explore a framework for deriving multi-row cuts. For this purpose, we favor the method of superadditive lifting. This technique is largely driven by our ability to construct superadditive under-approximations of a special value function known as the <b>lifting</b> <b>function.</b> We devote our effort to precisely this task. 	 	Chapter 3 reviews the theory behind superadditive lifting and returns to the classical problem of lifted flow cover inequalities. For this specific example, the <b>lifting</b> <b>function</b> we wish to approximate is quite complicated. We overcome this difficulty by adopting an indirect method for proving the validity of a superadditive approximation. Finally, we adapt the idea to high-dimensional lifting problems, where evaluating the exact <b>lifting</b> <b>function</b> often poses an immense challenge. Thus we open entirely unexplored problems to the powerful technique of lifting. 	 	Next, in Chapter 4, we consider the computational aspects of constructing strong superadditive approximations. Our primary contribution is a finite algorithm that constructs non-dominated superadditive approximations. This can be used to build superadditive approximations on-the-fly to strengthen cuts derived during computation. Alternately, it can be used offline to guide the search for strong superadditive approximations through numerical examples. 	 	We follow up in Chapter 5 by applying the ideas of Chapters 3 and 4 to high-dimensional lifting problems. By working out explicit examples, we are able to identify non-dominated superadditive approximations for high-dimensional <b>lifting</b> <b>functions.</b> These approximations strengthen existing families of cuts obtained from single-row relaxations. Lastly, we show via the stable set problem how the derivation of the <b>lifting</b> <b>function</b> and its superadditive approximation can be entirely embedded in the computation of cuts. 	 	Finally, we conclude by identifying future avenues of research that arise as natural extensions of the work in this thesis.

Pade approximants of Loewy's <b>lift</b> deficiency <b>function,</b> for various wake spacing and radial location parameters of a helicopter typical rotor blade section, are presented...|$|R

In order to evaluate such outputs, a <b>lifting</b> <b>function</b> v? must be chosen. In the standard finite element context, this choice is not relevant, whereas in the reduced basis context, as we show, it greatly affects the output error. We propose two “good ” choices for v?, and illustrate their effect on the output error by examining a numerical example. We also make clear the role of v? in a more general primal-dual reduced basis approximation framework. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{finite element method}} with B-spline basis {{functions}} was implemented and tested for the Poisson equation and the Biharmonic equation in an isoparametric setting. The equations were solved on a unit square and a B-spline geometry in physical space for given boundary conditions. The convergence rate of the finite element method for p-degree spline basis functions was verified using a least squares approximation and Schoenberg's variation diminishing spline approximation for the <b>lifting</b> <b>functions.</b> For the Poisson equation weak enforcement by the classical Lagrange multiplier method was also considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the theory of}} cutting planes for mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). Minimal valid inequalities are well understood for a relaxation of an MILP in tableau form where all the nonbasic variables are continuous. In this paper we study <b>lifting</b> <b>functions</b> for the nonbasic integer variables starting from such minimal valid inequalities. We characterize precisely when the lifted coefficient is equal to the coefficient of the corresponding continuous variable in every minimal lifting. The answer is a nonconvex region that can be obtained as the union of convex polyhedra. ...|$|R
