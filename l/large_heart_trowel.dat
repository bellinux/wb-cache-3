50|$|The X factor theory {{proposes that}} a {{mutation}} within a gene {{located on the}} x chromosome of horses causes a larger-than-average heart. A larger-than average heart was documented in certain high-performance Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, and Standardbred racehorses. It was first seen in Eclipse, at 6.4 kg (14 pounds). A <b>large</b> <b>heart</b> was also seen in Phar Lap (6.4 kg/14 lb), Sham (8.2 kg), and Secretariat (estimated at 10 kg). It is also proposed as a theory that the great producing mare Pocahontas was homozygous for the X factor. <b>Large</b> <b>hearts</b> {{have been found in}} four major Thoroughbred lines, all descendants of Eclipse: Princequillo, War Admiral, Blue Larkspur and Mahmoud. Many outstanding race horses such as Eclipse and Secretariat were noted for being excellent broodmare producers but generally failed to produce male offspring with the ability of their sires, thus the theory that the gene was carried only on the x chromosome meant that stallions with <b>large</b> <b>hearts</b> could only pass on the trait via their daughters.|$|R

500|$|An {{extremely}} <b>large</b> <b>heart</b> is a {{trait that}} occasionally occurs in Thoroughbreds, hypothesized {{to be linked}} to a genetic condition, called the [...] "x-factor", passed down in specific inheritance patterns. The x-factor {{can be traced to the}} historic racehorse Eclipse, who was necropsied after his death in 1789. Because Eclipse's heart appeared to be much larger than other horses, it was weighed, and found to be , almost twice the normal weight. Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters, and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces in his dam line to a daughter of Eclipse. Secretariat's success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this <b>large</b> <b>heart</b> theory. However, it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists, let alone increases athletic ability.|$|R
