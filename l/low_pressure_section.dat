Based on the flow of exhaust gases, HRSGs are categorized into vertical and horizontal types. In horizontal type HRSGs, exhaust gas flows horizontally over vertical tubes whereas in vertical type HRSGs, exhaust gas flow vertically over horizontal tubes. Based on pressure levels, HRSGs can {{be categorized}} into single pressure and multi pressure. Single pressure HRSGs have only one steam drum and steam is generated at single pressure level whereas multi pressure HRSGs employ two (double pressure) or three (triple pressure) steam drums. As such triple pressure HRSGs consist of three sections: an LP (<b>low</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>section,</b> a reheat/IP (intermediate pressure) section, and an HP (high pressure) section. Each section has a steam drum and an evaporator section where water is converted to steam. This steam then passes through superheaters to raise the temperature beyond the saturation point.|$|E

In long blades of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> stages the forcing can be obtained by the untwisting of twisted blades due to the effect of the huge centrifugal forces. The dynamic behavior of these blade rows is difficult to predict due to the nonlinear effect of the contact forces and due to friction. Different models for the contact are proposed and compared. The resulting natural frequencies of the blade row as a function of the different nodal diameter mode shapes are highly depending on the assumed models. For avoiding resonant conditions with engine order excitations, the natural frequencies must be calculated with good accuracy.

50|$|In comparison, a {{compressor}} refrigerator uses an electrically powered compressor {{to increase the}} pressure on the gaseous refrigerant. The resulting hot, high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger ("condenser") that is exposed to the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant, now at a temperature near to that of the external environment, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section. The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high <b>pressure</b> condenser <b>section</b> and the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> evaporator <b>section.</b> The lower <b>pressure</b> in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate, which absorbs heat from the refrigerator food compartment.

Another technology for mounting blades on the shaft is to do it {{in such a way that}} the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds: this should allow the continuity of the contact without clearances also at rated speed and full load. In this case the blades are called “pre-twisted”. Field experience has shown that these kinds of blade rows has a “robust and smooth” behavior. But there is still some lack of theoretical/numerical investigation for defining its dynamical behavior in different operating conditions, both for the blades with clearance and with pre-twist. The aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the non-linear dynamic behavior of a couple of shrouded blades, taking account of contact forces and friction. An equivalent linear model has then been developed for analyzing the behavior of the complete blade row. Also some provisional experimental results on non-rotating blade rows are presented...|$|R

An increase in aerodynamic loading of blades in the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine <b>section</b> of aircraft gas turbine engines has the potential to reduce engine weight or increase power extraction. Increased blade loading means larger pressure gradients and increased secondary losses near the endwall. Prior work has emphasized the importance of reducing these losses if highly loaded blades are to be utilized. The present study analyzes the secondary flow field of the front-loaded low-pressure turbine blade designated L 2 F with and without blade profile contouring at the junction of the blade and endwall. The current work explores the loss production mechanisms inside the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine cascade. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry data, total pressure loss data and oil flow visualization are used to describe the secondary flow field. The flow is analyzed in terms of total pressure loss, vorticity, Q-Criterion, Reynolds’ stresses, turbulence intensity and turbulence production. The flow description is then expanded upon using an Implicit Large Eddy Simulation of the flow field. The RANS momentum equations contain terms with static pressure derivatives. With some manipulation these equations can be rearranged to form an equation for the change in total pressure along a streamline as a function of velocity only. After simplifying for the flow field in question the equation can be interpreted as the total pressure transport along a streamline. A comparison of the total pressure transport calculated from the velocity components and the total pressure loss is presented and discussed. Peak values of total pressure transport overlap peak values of total pressure loss through and downstream of the passage suggesting that total pressure transport is a useful tool for localizing and predicting loss origins and loss development using velocity data which can be obtained non-intrusively...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{designing}} of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> sewer systems. It summarizes the general designing knowledge of <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> sewers and pumping stations, summarizes {{the technical requirements}} according to Czech water companies for <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> sewer systems and compares them with the established technical standards. The thesis also contains the search and comparison of several equation methods used to define the amount of designed flow of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> sewers, in addition to reviewing the present situation of the pumping station, considering the technical standards and technical requirements...|$|R

Students play the roles of "air molecules" to simulate high and <b>low</b> <b>pressures,</b> and use balloons to simulate clouds. They should be able to describe high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> areas, identify a front, and explain why areas of high pressure seek areas of <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> There is also a suggestion for a follow-up activity in which students use their new understanding of air pressure to help them read weather maps.
