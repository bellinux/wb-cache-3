The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did {{the way in which they}} were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of <b>Legal</b> <b>Metrology</b> (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E

30|$|The {{origins of}} {{software}} validation trace {{back to the}} very origins of computer programs and their attempted formal definitions. Indeed, classical theoretical computer science results refer to the general impossibility of determining/enforcing properties of programs, such as the well-known theorems by Turing [5] and Rice [6]. Classical programming analysis tools and their representations such as flowcharts, control flow graphs, and call graphs [7] help both the development and the characterization of computer programs, and some formal methods [8] aim at developing software whose behaviors (possible states and their transitions) can be completely characterized. A myriad of software engineering methods [9, 10] has been developed {{with the goal of}} providing some level of control over complex enterprise information systems. Despite the large number of methods and tools, the general goal is one and the same: to provide confidence that the software behaves as it should behave, performing the tasks it was programmed to perform—and nothing else. In the field of cyber-physical systems and critical systems in general, it has become increasingly common that government, regulators and users require more mature validation processes before a new version of software is deployed. Examples include regulations in Canada and Brazil [11, 12], which specify requirements to be adopted before the approval of metering devices. Both regulations are based on the International Organization of <b>Legal</b> <b>Metrology’s</b> Guidance document D- 31 : General Requirements for Software Controlled Measuring Instruments [13]. In the case of Canada [11], the source code per se does not constitute an input for the validation, as the assessment process is based on functional tests and documentation review. The regulation in Brazil [12], on the other hand, relies on source code disclosure to perform deeper validation tests during the assessment process. It also includes functional tests and documentation review.|$|R

In supporting this research, therefore, some respondent are picking as the sample (the users of kWh meter that are household, R 1 450 VA and R 1 900 VA). Meanwhile, the problem formulation appears based on some indicators. Each of them is describe in questioner, which is proof the hypothesis. As the result, the research says that there is positive low rate correlation among the policy content, human resources, communications and environment toward recalibration of kWh meter in Metrology bureau of Surakarta city.

Mohr et al., Data and Analysis for the CODATA 2017 Special Fundamental Constants Adjustment for the Revision of the SI, Metrologia 2018, September 2017 preprint), with a comparison to the CODATA 2014 adjustment. In Appendix, a comment is also added on the paper Possolo et al., Metrologia 55 (2018) 29 on the Planck constant. The previous versions of this manuscript (also available on ArXiv) were aiming at pointing out some standing features of {{the present and future}} CODATA method {{in the light of the}} CODATA table of 2014 recommended values for the fundamental constants. A comprehensive discussion on this and related issues is becoming very important in view of the foreseen revision of the International System (SI) of measurement units in 2018.
