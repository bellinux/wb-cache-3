5|$|The lungs of <b>lungfish</b> {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, {{internal}} septa. In the Australian <b>lungfish,</b> there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other <b>lungfish</b> and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline.

Fossils of these burrows have been discovered in the red siltstone formations in and near the park.|$|E
40|$|There is {{very little}} {{reported}} data concerning reproduction and hormones of reproduction for the two living groups of sarcopterygian fishes, the coelacanths and the <b>lungfishes.</b> In general terms, coelacanths are viviparous and <b>lungfishes</b> are oviparous. Both are large fishes and very long-lived. They inhabit the warmer latitudes of the southern hemisphere, the coelacanths being confined to the more even conditions of the deep oceans and the <b>lungfishes</b> to the very variable conditions of subtropical freshwater streams and rivers. Their differing modes of reproduction are described in this chapter and some comparisons with other vertebrates are made. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The only {{currently}} unresolved {{portion of}} the backbone phylogeny of the vertebrates involves the relationships among coelacanths, <b>lungfishes,</b> and tetrapods. Despite active research on this question {{over the past three}} decades, it is still difficult to determine statistically whether <b>lungfishes</b> alone or both <b>lungfishes</b> and coelacanths together are closely related to tetrapods. To resolve this controversy, we assembled a data set comprising 1, 290 nuclear genes encoding 690, 838 amino acid residues by analyzing available genome and transcriptome data. Phylogenetic analyses of this data set provided overwhelming evidence that the <b>lungfishes</b> are the closest living relatives of the land vertebrates. This result is strongly supported by high bootstrap values from maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses, Bayesian posterior probabilities of CAT model analysis, and topological tests. Additionally, a species tree analysis without data concatenation also strongly supported this result. Key words: transcriptome, phylogenomics, Sarcopterygii, coelacanth, species tree. The “living fossils, ” coelacanths and <b>lungfishes,</b> are the only two extant lobe-finned fish groups. Determining which group is more closely related to tetrapods is of importance if we are to understand how land vertebrates originated and colonize...|$|R

5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and <b>lungfish,</b> have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of <b>lungfish,</b> the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in <b>lungfish</b> or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African <b>lungfish,</b> must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Since the {{discovery}} of the coelacanth, La t imer ia cha lumnae, more than 50 years ago, pa-leontologists and comparative morphologists have debated whether coelacanths or <b>lungfishes,</b> two groups of lobe-finned fishes, are the closest living relatives of land vertebrates (Tetrapoda). Previous-ly, Meyer and Wilson (1990) determined partial DNA sequences from two conservative mitochon-drial genes and found support for a close relation-ship of <b>lungfishes</b> to tetrapods. We present addi-tional DNA sequences from the 12 S rRNA mitochondrial gene for three species of the two lin-eages of <b>lungfishes</b> that were not represented in the first study: Protopterus annec tens and Protopterus aethiopicus from Africa and Neoceratodus forster...|$|R

5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. <b>Lungfish,</b> {{with the exception of the}} Australian <b>lungfish,</b> and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in <b>lungfish,</b> sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, <b>lungfish</b> (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E

5|$|The {{tetrapods}} {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive tetrapods developed from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull. The coelacanth group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines of descent and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the coelacanths) and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the <b>lungfish</b> and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and <b>lungfish.</b> These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. <b>Lungfish</b> are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
50|$|Dipteridae is an extinct {{family of}} prehistoric <b>lungfishes</b> which lived from the Devonian period to the Triassic period.|$|R
50|$|The Rhipidistia, {{also known}} as dipnotetrapodomorphs (formally Dipnotetrapodomorpha) are a clade of lobe-finned fishes which include the {{tetrapods}} and <b>lungfishes.</b> Rhipidistia formerly referred to a subgroup of Sarcopterygii consisting of the Porolepiformes and Osteolepiformes, a definition that is now obsolete. However as cladistic understanding of the vertebrates has improved {{over the last few}} decades a monophyletic Rhipidistia is now understood to include the whole of Tetrapoda and the <b>lungfishes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Autoradiographic {{and silver}} methods {{indicate}} that the African and South American <b>lungfishes,</b> Protopterus and Lepidosiren, lack ipsilateral retinal projections. Contralaterally, the retina projects to the preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, to four discrete areas located in the lateral neuropil of the thalamus, to a superficial pretectal neuropil, to {{the upper half of}} the tectal neuropil, and to a laterally situated basal optic neuropil located in the rostral tegmentum. The overall pattern of the primary retinofugal projections is markedly similar to that of amphibians which suggests that <b>lungfishes</b> may be more closely related to amphibians than to actinopterygian fishes. Neotenic trends in both lepidosirenid <b>lungfishes</b> and urodeles may be expressions of parallelism, hence Latimeria and Neoceratodus must be examined to resolve this phylogenetic problem. A 300 -fold range {{in the size of the}} eye, indicated by the number of ganglion cells present, occurs among <b>lungfishes,</b> salamanders and frogs. This variation may have implications for recognizing the morphological expression of selection operating on the visual systems of lepidosirenids and amphibians...|$|R
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the <b>lungfish</b> Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{is exposed}} over the {{southern}} {{slope of the}} North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle facies association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid <b>lungfish,</b> turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes {{that have been found}} belong to the families Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented with Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.|$|E
5|$|While Sauropelta was an {{important}} part of the Cloverly herbivore guild, the most abundant herbivorous dinosaur of the time was the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The smaller ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, rare titanosaur sauropods, and an unknown type of ornithomimosaur also lived alongside Sauropelta. The dromaeosaurid theropod Deinonychus fed upon some of these herbivores, and the sheer number of Deinonychus teeth scattered throughout the formation are a testament to its abundance. Microvenator, a small basal oviraptorosaur, hunted smaller prey, while the apex predators of the Cloverly was the large allosauroid theropod Acrocanthosaurus. <b>Lungfish,</b> triconodont mammals, and several species of turtles lived in the Cloverly, while crocodilians prowled the rivers, lakes, and swamps, providing evidence of a year-round warm climate. The Late Jurassic fauna dominated by allosauroids, stegosaurs, and many varieties of huge sauropods gave way by Cloverly times to an Early Cretaceous fauna in which dromaeosaurs, ornithopods, and nodosaurs like Sauropelta were predominant. After the Cloverly ended, a large wave of Asian animals, including tyrannosaurids, ceratopsians, and ankylosaurids would disperse into western North America, forming the mixed fauna seen throughout the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
