5|$|There were, of course, {{numerous}} {{reasons for}} maintaining roads. A unified political {{system could be}} maintained {{only as long as}} the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed. Such a system of transportation, once established, facilitated commerce. At the local <b>level,</b> <b>road</b> and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E
25|$|The route {{recommended}} {{was similar}} to the 1985 proposal. The line would have traveled across the Kaingaroa Plains and followed the route more or less presently taken by the private forestry road, High <b>Level</b> <b>Road.</b> Stage one of the proposal would terminate at the junction between the two private forestry roads, High <b>Level</b> <b>Road</b> and the Off-Highway road leading from the Taupo Mill, near the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo road. A recommendation was made that a log-processing yard be built at the junction of these two roads in conjunction with the rail line extension from Murupara.|$|E

25|$|The Eritrean {{highway system}} is named {{according}} to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T).

25|$|In {{combination}} with Butler's offensive {{north of the}} James River, Grant extended his left flank to cut Confederate lines of communication southwest of Petersburg. Two divisions of the IX corps under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, two divisions of the V Corps under Warren, and Gregg's cavalry division {{were assigned to the}} operation. On September 30, the Federals marched via Poplar Spring Church to reach Squirrel Level and Vaughan Roads. The initial Federal attack overran Fort Archer, flanking the Confederates out of their Squirrel <b>Level</b> <b>Road</b> line. Late afternoon, Confederate reinforcements arrived, slowing the Federal advance. On October 1, the Federals repulsed a Confederate counterattack directed by A.P. Hill. Reinforced by Maj. Gen. Gershom Mott's division, the Federals resumed their advance on October 2, captured Fort MacRae (which was lightly defended) and extended their left flank to the vicinity of Peebles' and Pegram's Farms. With these limited successes, Meade suspended the offensive. A new line was entrenched from the Federal works on Weldon Railroad to Pegram's Farm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} dynamic wheel {{load on the}} road, a dynamic multi-axle vehicle mode has been developed, {{which is based on}} {{distribute}} loading weight and treats tire stiffness as the function of tire pressure and wheel load. Taking a tractor-semitrailer as representative, the influence factors and the influence law of the dynamic load were studied. It is found that the load coefficient increases with the increase of road roughness, vehicle speed and tire pressure, yet it decreases with the increase of axle load. Combining the influences of road roughness, vehicle speed, axle load and tire pressure, the dynamic load coefficient is 1. 14 for the <b>level</b> A <b>road,</b> 1. 19 for the <b>level</b> B <b>road,</b> 1. 27 for the <b>level</b> C <b>road,</b> and 1. 36 for the <b>level</b> D <b>road...</b>|$|R

500|$|East of MD 543, MD 22 reduces to two {{lanes and}} passes the {{historic}} Dibb House and Tudor Hall, the latter notable {{for being the}} boyhood home of John Wilkes Booth. [...] The state highway passes through the hamlet of Schucks Corner and intersects Thomas Run Road, which leads to Thomas Run Park, Harford Technical High School, Thomas Run Church, Medical Hall Historic District, and the historic Hays-Heighe House {{on the campus of}} Harford Community College. In the unincorporated village of Churchville, MD 22 intersects MD 136 (Calvary Road/Priestbridge Road) adjacent to the community's namesake, Churchville Presbyterian Church. After meeting the west end of MD 155 (<b>Level</b> <b>Road)</b> immediately to the east, the state highway curves to the south. After MD 156 (Aldino Road) splits to the east, MD 22 returns to an eastward heading to pass through the hamlet of Carsins. The state highway expands to a four-lane highway immediately before intersecting Long Drive, which serves as the entrance to Ripken Stadium, home of the Aberdeen IronBirds. Just east of the stadium complex, the state highway meets I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
