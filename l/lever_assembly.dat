50|$|Carried {{over from}} the 207 RC, the {{interior}} received grinium finish decor with front and rear bucket seats as well as RC front and rear mat covers. The steering wheel too, with a granium finish ring and numbered from 1 to 2000. The gearshift <b>lever</b> knob, pedal <b>assembly,</b> foot rest and door sill are in aluminium.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising's complex design of many small pins, plungers, springs and <b>levers.</b> Disassembly and <b>assembly</b> was {{difficult}} even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the action bar was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn't be sensed by feel at night if {{it was in the}} safe, semi, or automatic position.|$|R
50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a <b>lever</b> operated cam <b>assembly</b> on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the wheel to the fork. Wheels equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the cam lever, thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|R
5000|$|Levers {{evolved over}} time from being all {{aluminum}} with non-drilled lever arms to using resin bodies and drilled lever arms in some later models. Two varieties of hoods were supplied: half-hoods covering {{only the top}} of the <b>lever</b> <b>assembly,</b> or full-hoods covering the entire body of the <b>lever</b> <b>assembly.</b> Both included the built-in adjusters that allowed riders to adjust brake clearance while riding. MAFAC also supplied rubber lever arm covers as an option.|$|E

40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable through bores on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a spring assembly on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device. A lever is rotatable through 90 deg to move a latching rod to sequentially actuate and expand collet fingers and to actuate the spring assembly by compressing it. During the first 30 deg of movement of the lever, the collet fingers are actuated by the latching rod to provide a radial expansion and during the last 60 deg of movement of the <b>lever,</b> the spring <b>assembly</b> acts as a force mechanism and is actuated to develop a compressive latching force on the devices. The latching rod and lever are connected by a camming mechanism. The amount of spring force in the spring assembly can be adjusted; the body member can be permanently attached by a telescoping assembly to one of the devices; and the structure can be used as a pulling device for removing annular bearings or the like from blind bores...|$|R

50|$|The Holcroft {{valve gear}} was {{a type of}} {{conjugated}} valve gear designed by Harold Holcroft and used on three-cylinder steam locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). It bore many similarities to the Gresley conjugated valve gear used on the original LNER A1 design. It varied from the Gresley method of operation by using the combination <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> instead of the valve spindles to drive the middle cylinder of a three-cylinder design. This had operational advantages over Gresley's design.|$|E
50|$|These {{enable a}} 3-cylinder or 4-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to be built}} with only two sets of valve gear. The best known is Gresley conjugated valve gear, used on 3-cylinder locomotives. Walschaerts gear is usually used for the two outside cylinders. Two levers connected to the outside cylinder valve rods drive the valve for the inside cylinder. Harold Holcroft devised a different method for conjugating valve gear by linking the middle cylinder to the combination <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> of an outside cylinder, creating the Holcroft valve gear derivative. On a 4-cylinder locomotive the arrangement is simpler. The valve gear may be inside or outside and only short rocking-shafts are needed to link the valves {{on the inside and}} outside cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{valve gear}} {{assembly}} originally designed by Holcroft {{for use on}} the N1 class regulated {{the timing of the}} valve events that admitted steam into the cylinder, increasing efficiency whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effects of hammerblow on the track. Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight. This was achieved by using the combination <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> that controlled the fore and aft movement of the valve spindle, which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam through the ports.|$|E
50|$|The {{throttle}} <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is often}} designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the throttle levers actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it proved}} {{impractical}} {{to mount the}} conjugation apparatus behind the cylinders on the N1 Holcroft had to revise the design to have the apparatus {{in front of the}} cylinders. He did not wish to use an extension of the valve spindles, as on Gresley conjugated valve gear. Instead, Holcroft carried-forward the action of the combination <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> that controlled the fore and aft movement of the valve spindle (which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam out through the ports) to a pivot point connected to a lever from the [...] "inside" [...] valve spindle. The Holcroft variant held an advantage over Gresleyâ€™s [...] "conjugated" [...] design, as the valve timing was immune to variations brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the conjugation assembly when under heavy use. It also had potential maintenance benefits because most of the conjugation mechanism was located outside the locomotive frames and could thus be accessed without an inspection pit.|$|E
50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front valve spindles. This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and pivot bracket, affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination <b>lever</b> <b>assembly</b> to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|E
