50|$|Construction on {{the tunnel}} began in 1888, before the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad had even reached the Belmont area. The {{contractor}} was Kilpatrick Bros. & Collins. The workers being promised $1.50 to $1.74 per day, but on arriving in Belmont learned {{they would be}} earning $0.15 an hour. Many of the men went back home, but 1,200 men stayed {{to work on the}} tunnel, many of whom were Italian. The tunnel was dug from both its ends; the daily progress was normally about 3 ft per end, but sometimes distances of up to 6 ft were achieved. The tunnel was dug mostly through compacted sand with some thin strata of hard rock in between, making <b>light</b> <b>blasting</b> necessary. The rubble was hauled away in livestock-drawn carts. Cut locally from north and east of the site, timbers were used to support the tunnel. The Nebraska National Guard was on hand at all times to stop any vandalism attempts. The railroad trackage, heading north to Crawford from Alliance, reached the uncompleted tunnel on August 17, 1889, and Belmont served as the railway terminus until the tunnel was finished on August 25, 1889. It was lauded as one of the decade's greatest engineering feats. During World War I, guards were hired to prevent the tunnel from being sabotaged.|$|E
40|$|The {{ornamental}} stone {{industry is}} continuously seeking new cost effective methods to improve present day techniques of : (a) diamond wire cutting; (b) dense drilling followed by mechanical wedging or <b>light</b> <b>blasting</b> and (c) jet cutting, for extracting primary {{blocks from the}} quarry face and for splitting and squaring them to appropriate commercial sizes. Among the techniques proposed adn tested notching a borehole followed by wedging or decoupled blasting {{seems to be a}} commercially feasible technique provided that a suitable notching method becomes available. Notching can be used in soft non-abrasives stones such as marbles for splitting and squaring blocks and in hard and abrasive rocks (granites), where the diamond wire cutting technique can not be used effectively, for extraction from the bench face and for splitting and squaring. For marbles and many sandstones a detachable type notching tool fitted to a 7 / 8 '' hexagon drill still can be used with a hand held or mechanically mounted rock drill in which the rotation mechanism has been removed. In granites and other abrasive rocks having fracture toughness values twice as big as those of marbles a two stage linear explosive (hybrid explosive) is proposed for extraction of the rock from the quarry face and for secondary treatment. Laboratory and field tests in three different types of marble blocks and in granite blocks in the laboratory proved the cost effectiveness of the proposed techniques, which are also environmentally friendly since they produce less dust and reduce noise duration in comparison to present day practice...|$|E

The film was withdrawn from theaters after Universal Studios sued the production for being too similar to the film Jaws. Casterllari next film 1990: The Bronx Warriors was a surprise hit that created a small wave of films from Italy inspired by the John Carpenter film Escape from New York.

30|$|As shown early, the TIC in rock dust is {{the most}} {{important}} quality factor for preventing the propagation of mine explosion. Laboratory experiments show that different rock dusts (i.e., limestone, dolomite and magnesite) have similar inerting effectiveness for coal dust. However, tests with dolomite show that a decrease in rock dust particle size could significantly lower the amount required to inert (Amyotte et al. 1992). Limestone or other rock dusts could easily cohere to form a cake when wetted and then dried making dispersion more difficult in an event of a <b>light</b> <b>blast</b> of air. Hence, the effectiveness of the alternative inerting agents has been experimentally investigated in countries including Germany, US, South Africa, etc. Fly ash and calcium sulphate (CaSO 4) may be the good candidates but more testing works are required to prove this.|$|R

25|$|Hot blast allowed blast {{furnaces}} to use anthracite or lower grade coal.

40|$|Dispersible rock dust must {{be applied}} to the {{surfaces}} of entries in underground coal mines in order to inert the coal dust entrained or made airborne during an explosion and prevent propagating explosions. 30 CFR. 75. 2 states that " 22 ̆ 0 ac 6 [rock dust particles] when wetted and dried will not cohere to form a cake which will not be dispersed into separate particles by a <b>light</b> <b>blast</b> of air 22 ̆ 0 ac 6 " However, a proper definition or quantification of "light blast of air" is not provided. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has, consequently, designed a dust dispersion chamber to conduct quantitative laboratory-scale dispersibility experiments as a screening tool for candidate rock dusts. A reproducible pulse of air is injected into the chamber and across a shallow tray of rock dust. The dust dispersed and carried downwind is monitored. The mass loss of the dust tray and the airborne dust measurements determine the relative dispersibility of the dust with respect to a Reference rock dust. This report describes the design and the methodology to evaluate the relative dispersibility of rock dusts with and without anti-caking agents. Further, {{the results of this study}} indicate that the dispersibility of rock dusts varies with particle size, type of anti-caking agent used, and with the untapped bulk density.

40|$|In this study, {{two types}} of coating systems were {{investigated}} {{for their ability to}} withstand cyclic oxidation conditions. NiCoCrAlY coatings with either 0. 1 or 0. 5 weight percent yttrium as well as platinum modified aluminide coatings were examined. All of the samples were exposed cyclically, in a bottom-loading furnace at 1100 °C in laboratory air. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the samples. Various surface treatments were performed on the coatings prior to their exposure. Samples were either exposed as-received, with no treatment, <b>light</b> grit <b>blasted</b> (LGB), <b>light</b> grit <b>blasted</b> and etched with NaOH, or fine polished. The samples containing 0. 5 wt. % Y in the as received, LGB and LGB and etched condition, failed by the formation of large oxide protrusions caused by the preferential oxidation of yttrium and by cracking in the coating. The fine polished NiCoCrAlY coatings containing 0. 5 wt. %Y did not develop protrusions and did not fail in test. None of the 0. 1 wt. %Y coatings with any treatment developed protrusions and none of these failed in test. The PtAl coatings all failed by the formation of large voids at the coating/substrate interface that coalesced and broke through the coating surface, regardless of surface treatment. It was concluded that, in the NiCoCrAlY system, the roughness of the coating surface as well as the amount of yttrium present to oxidize in the coating plays a large role in the coating lifetime. In the PtAl coatings, surface preparation did not appear to {{have an effect on the}} coating lifetime. The PtAl coatings and the rough NiCoCrAlY coatings containing 0. 5 wt. %Y were found to have similar lifetimes of a few thousand cycles.
