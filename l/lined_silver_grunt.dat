50|$|On December 13, 2009, the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line,</b> Metro's second Metro Transitway (bus rapid transit) line, began service {{between the}} Harbor Gateway Transit Center, Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station. Unlike the Blue <b>Line,</b> the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> charges extra since the line {{runs on the}} I-110 freeway. The Metro Blue Line and the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> are roughly 2-4 miles apart. Some former Blue Line {{passengers}} have switched to the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> When there are delays and technical problems on the Blue Line, Metro temporarily removes the extra charge on the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> so that passengers can use it instead. Ridership has increased on the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> since its opening, {{but not enough to}} relieve the Blue Line's ridership.|$|R

50|$|There are six transit {{stations}} on {{the main}} section of the Harbor transitway (the section with high-occupancy lanes): 37th Street Station, Slauson Station, Manchester Station, Harbor Freeway/I-105 Station, Rosecrans Station and Harbor Gateway Transit Center (to one side).

There are a further two stations on the freeway {{to the south of}} the transitway: Carson Station and Pacific Coast Highway station. On December 13, Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> was extended to serve and terminate in San Pedro. The extension replaced the former Metro Express <b>Line</b> 450. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> extension follows the exactly routing of Line 450 and terminates at Pacific Ave/21st Street. Along with the replacement of Line 450, a new Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> faster version of the line began operation. Dubbed as the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Express (Line 950X), the line mirrors the current route and stops of Line 450. Not all Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> trips end in San Pedro.|$|R

2500|$|The MBTA and MassDOT are {{building}} a new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> route to Chelsea via East Boston, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Gateway [...] project. An exclusive busway and four new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> stations will be built in Chelsea—Eastern Avenue, Box District, Bellingham Square and Chelsea. A new $20 million Chelsea commuter rail station and transit hub will be constructed at the Chelsea station terminus of the new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> route near the Mystic Mall, so that trains will no longer block Sixth Street. The new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> and commuter rail stations will be fully handicapped accessible. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> extension and new commuter rail stop will be built in two phases. Construction began in 2015, and initial service is expected to start in April 2018, with the new train station opening in 2019.|$|R
50|$|Usage of {{the lanes}} and bus {{services}} has been low, but the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> has helped raise ridership on the Harbor Transitway. The Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> began service on December 13, 2009. Ridership {{is lower than}} the El Monte Busway, which is also served by the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> A number of reasons have been identified: The main causes for the low ridership are the premium express fare charged to passengers compared to riders on the Blue Line and Metro Rapid (up to $1 more each way than a trip made on the Rapid or Blue Line), the isolated and noisy freeway environment of the stations, and the inconvenience of accessing the stations (and lack of surrounding buses) around the stations compared to surface level light rail or Rapid service. Ridership began increasing {{with the advent of the}} Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> In late June 2011, Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> service frequency increased from 30 mins to 15 mins on Weekdays and on Saturdays, service increased from 60 mins to 40 mins. In the February 2012 Metro Express Lanes Program report, ridership on the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone on the Harbor Transitway was 3,969. The report revealed that ridership on the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone increased 43% from the June 2011 improved frequency of the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> On June 17, 2012 Metro added the second phase of adding more service to the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> Weekday peak hour service was added for the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 10 mins to 4-8 mins). Saturday, Sunday/Holiday service was added for the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 40 mins to 20 mins on Saturdays and from 60 mins to 30 mins on Sundays/Holidays).|$|R
50|$|In December 2015, Metro {{restructured}} the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> and Metro Express 450X. Now during {{off-peak hours}} and weekends some <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> trips travel to San Pedro and during weekday peak periods a <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Express route operates between San Pedro and El Monte, skipping {{most of the}} stations along the Harbor Transitway. The change gave passengers a one-seat ride to San Pedro during the off-peak periods and created more <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> service on the El Monte Busway.|$|R
5000|$|On February 22, 2012 an {{incident}} {{occurred on the}} northbound Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> platform during the afternoon. A vehicle struck the northbound platform of the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> The Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> bus was not hit by the private truck when it was entering the station.There were 7 passengers who were about aboard the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> bus to Downtown LA as a vehicle struck the platform. The 7 passengers received critical and serious injuries. It took around 2 hours to clear up the scene. During the incident, the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line,</b> Metro Express Lines: 450X and 550 were detoured to stop at Figueroa Street/Harbor FWY station entrance. There has never been {{an incident}} on the Harbor Transitway ever since it first opened on June 1998. As {{a result of the}} incident, Metro's CEO: Art Leahy asked Metro's safety committee to review the station layout and signage of the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> stations on the Harbor Transitway portion. A report was scheduled within 60 days after the incident. The report was complete during April 2012 [...] Bollards were added during early August 2012 at the station. Bollards were also installed at the 37th Street/USC Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Station as well.|$|R
30|$|The use of {{electronic}} collimation implies, however, {{that the original}} field size has been overestimated. In the era of film-screen radiography radiologists could check the field size by simply looking at the <b>silver</b> <b>lining.</b> The <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> denotes a millimetre-wide white margin around the radiographic image (see Fig.  1 a). These margins appear bright on the image as beyond {{the edges of the}} collimated beam no X-rays hit the detector [7]. This <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> thus shows how the light beam diaphragm was used to position the X-ray beam and, as it is technique-independent, it is present in both film-screen and digital images. However, when images have been electronically collimated in digital radiography, we are no longer able to see the <b>silver</b> <b>lining.</b> Digital radiography systems may even have software that automatically removes the <b>silver</b> <b>lining,</b> as {{it has been suggested that}} this may affect viewing conditions [8].|$|R

50|$|Like {{the other}} Metro Rail and Metro Busway <b>lines,</b> the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> {{operates}} on a proof-of-payment system. Passengers may board at either the front or rear door of <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> buses and validate their Transit Access Pass (TAP) electronic fare card at readers located {{on board the}} bus, near the door. Since TAP vending machines are not available at all <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> stations and street stops, passengers who need to purchase or revalue their cards can do so at the farebox on board the bus. Metro's fare inspectors randomly inspect buses to ensure passengers have a valid fare product on their TAP card.|$|R

For the June 2013 service changes, a new Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> stop was added at Figueroa Street & 23rd Street. For the December 15, 2013 service changes, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line's</b> southbound route was modified to run on Flower Street.
