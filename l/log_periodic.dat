40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{considerable}} research efforts have been put into the design of Ultra Wideband (UWB) antennas and systems for communication. According to FCC, a UWB system covers a very wide spectrum of frequencies ranging from 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz and therefore, antennas for such systems must also have an ultra wide bandwidth in order to cover this frequency range. Conventionally, UWB antennas are non-resonant types such as <b>log</b> <b>periodics</b> and spirals. However, these types of antennas tend to be dispersive which distort and stretch out the radiated waveform. This {{is due to the}} fact that these types of antennas radiate different frequency components from different parts of the antenna. Previous studies have shown that UWB performance can also be achieved by approximately modifying the wire antenna by introducing planar shapes such as circular and elliptical discs. These planar antennas, which contain circular and elliptical discs, have potential to obtain ultra wide bandwidth, and hence are capable of covering the whole UWB spectrum as defined by the FCC for UWB systems. This is made possible by the intrinsic characteristics of their geometries. Approximately, the lower end of the bandwidth of planar monopole antennas is determined by their height above the ground plane as well as their surface area. The first lowest operational frequency (in GHz) can be approximately determined using th...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the emergent behaviour of complex systems {{is probably one of}} the most intriguing challenges in modern theoretical physics. In the present Thesis we use novel data analysis techniques and numerical simulations in order to shed some light on the fundamental mechanisms involved in their dynamics. We divide the main core of the research into three parts, each of which address a specific, and formally well defined, issue. In the first part, we study the processes of self - organization and herding in the evolution of the stock market. The data analysis, carried out over the fluctuations of several international indices, shows an avalanche - like dynamics characterized by power laws and indicative of a critical state. Further evidence of criticality relates to the behaviour of the price index itself. In this case we observe a power law decline with superimposed embedded <b>log</b> - <b>periodic</b> oscillations which are possibly due to an intrinsic discrete scale invariance. A stochastic cellular automata, instead, is used to mimic an open stock market and reproduce the herding behaviour responsible for the large fluctuations observed in the price. The results underline the importance of the largest clusters of traders which, alone, can induce a large displacement between demand and supply and lead to a crash. The second part of the Thesis focuses on the role played by the complex network of interactions that is created among the elementary parts of the system itself. We consider, in particular, the influence of the so - called " scale - free " networks, where the distribution of connectivity follows a power law, on the antiferromagnetic Ising model and on a model of stochastic opinion formation. Novel features, not encountered on regular lattices, have been pointed out. In the former case a spin glass transition at low temperatures is present while, in the latter, the turbulent - like behaviour emerging from the model is found to be particularly robust against the indecision of the agents. The last part is left for a numerical investigation of an extremal dynamical model for evolution / extinction of species. We demonstrate how the mutual cooperation between them comes to play a fundamental role in the survival probability : a healthy environment can support even less fitted species. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The vertical resolution of a given logging device sets an upper limit on its temporal resolution, so we present theoretical estimates for the minimum sedimentation rates required to resolve bedding cycles at the primary orbital periodicities using the standard suite of Schlumberger logging tools. We also investigate the sedimentologic origin of the 5 - to 6 -m bedding cycles within the logging data collected at Hole 798 B on the Oki Ridge. Contiguous 30 -cm channel samples were taken from Cores 128 - 798 B- 13 H,- 14 H, and- 15 H to mimic tool resolution, and these were analyzed for biogenic opal, carbonate, terrigenous percent, and bulk mineralogy by X-ray diffraction. The 5 - to 6 -m cycles apparent within the log data are equivalent to- 40 k. y. based on the average sedimentation rate (- 13 cm/k. y.) of the 1. 0 - to 2. 8 -Ma sequence.

Two pressing questions for forestry and conservation biology are whether <b>periodic</b> <b>logging</b> in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods. Such questions of timber resource management, however, are rarely applied to nonpest insect species, particularly in temperate forest systems. We studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness, abundance, and community composition of forest Lepidoptera (moths). Moths were sampled in 16 forest stands occurring in two watersheds (managed and wilderness) in southeastern Ohio during summer 2000. Stands were chosen from one of four management categories: clear-cut, selectively logged, unlogged, and wilderness. Specifically, we tested the following predictions: (1) shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest changes in stand structure and floristic composition, (2) variation in species richness would be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance, and (3) unlogged stands within managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness stands. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed significant compositional differences among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime. Variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand floristic composition rather than stand structure. Postdisturbance shifts in moth community composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier successional stages. We also found that both species richness of the overall moth community and several feeding guilds were significantly lower in clear-cut stands, but species richness did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands. Thus, selective logging appears to be a better strategy for timber harvest when concern is for maintaining species richness of Lepidoptera within stands. Finally, although no differences were detected in overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness watersheds, the CCA suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation in community composition within and among forest stands. Therefore, we suggest that the long-term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber may ultimately depend on successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests. Funding for this research was provided by grants from the Ohio Board of Regents Research Challenge Program, the Ohio Biological Survey, and Sigma Xi...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relative compatibility of timber vs. {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) harvest of Carapa guianensis for population persistence and income generation in two forest types in the Brazilian Amazon. C. guianensis is a multi-use tropical tree valued for its seed oil and its high-quality timber. This dissertation focused on variable components of sustainable harvest, including quantifying patterns of natural seed production, modeling sustainable seed and timber harvests based on underlying demographic data collection, and simulating economic returns from seed and timber harvests by calculating the equal annual equivalent (EAE) of revenues associated with modeled simulations of seed and timber harvests. Our study demonstrated that multiple variables interact at different scales to influence seed production. Climatic cues were central to setting overall patterns in phenophases and seemed to best explain why high seed production years were consistent across both forest types examined. Individual tree attributes contributed to seed production heterogeneity within habitats; dbh, and cross-sectional canopy area showed positive, quadratic relationships with seed production, while vine load negatively affected seed production, irrespective of forest type. In our upland forest sites, demographic parameters suggested that no tested levels of seed and timber extraction were sustainable; quasi-extinction simulations indicated population decline regardless of harvest levels. Removing 10 % of the total seed production proved feasible and consistent with a stable or increasing population in occasionally inundated forests, though the quasi-extinction threshold of less than 3 individuals dbh ? 10 cm per hectare was reached within the 500 -year time interval. We also found the potential for compatibility between seed and timber harvest in occasionally inundated forests. Our results suggested that 10 % annual seed harvests were compatible with 100 % timber harvests (of trees ? 50 cm) twice a century, the equivalent of approximately two trees per hectare. Revenue from 100 % timber harvests (of individuals ? 50 cm every 25 -years) exceeded that of 10 % seed harvests when evaluated separately and applying labor costs of R$ 23 per kilogram of oil (US$ 12. 88). When we dropped those labor costs to R$ 12 (US$ 6. 72), however, seed harvest EAE surpassed that of timber harvest. In practice, however, benefits could accrue from both annual seed harvest revenues and <b>periodic</b> <b>logging</b> of C. guianensis individuals. Findings add to the ecological understanding of the mechanisms contributing to variable yearly seed production and represent {{an important first step}} in providing information geared toward encouraging ecological best management practices while maintaining profitable harvest scenarios...|$|R
