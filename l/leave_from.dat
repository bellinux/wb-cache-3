40|$|The {{study and}} {{understanding}} of alterations taking place during the micropropagation process can provide valuable information about this technology. The objective of this work was to evaluate the anatomical modifications in leaves of micropropagated banana (Musa spp.) plants during their adaptation to ex vitro conditions. Aseptic axillary shoots of `Preciosa` cultivar (AAAB) were rooted for 24 days in MS medium containing NAA (1 mg. l(- 1)) and agar (6 g. l(- 1)), and acclimatized for 120 days. The treatments consisted of leaves {{at different stages of}} development: T 1 - <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants at the end of in vitro rooting phase, T 2 persistent <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants after 30 days of acclimatization, T 3 - new <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants after 30 days of acclimatization (transition leaves). T 4 - transition <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants after 60 days, T 5 - new <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants after 60 days of acclimatization, and T 6 - new <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> plants after 120 days of acclimatization. A higher degree of differentiation and, thereby, better adaptation took place in <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> leaf primordial differentiated in ex vitro conditions. The acclimatization phase is crucial for a greater thickness and differentiation of spongy and palisade parenchyma, and to correct the modifications of plants developed in vitro. The study of leaf anatomy provides a better understanding of alterations occurring in micropropagated banana plants...|$|R
30|$|To monitor {{developmental}} {{expression of}} the OsGLP genes, tissue was harvested from the three most fully expanded <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> six 21 -day-old plants per cultivar; six <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> each position were pooled per cultivar. For expression experiments after M. oryzae inoculation, tissue was harvested by combining the three most fully expanded <b>leaves</b> pooled <b>from</b> two plants per cultivar. In the wounding experiments, the two youngest, wounded <b>leaves</b> were pooled <b>from</b> two plants per cultivar.|$|R
40|$|ATP sulfurylase {{activity}} varied greatly {{among different}} {{leaves on the}} soybean plant [Glycine max (L.) Meer. ], {{and high levels of}} activity did not appear in the leaves until the seedlings were about 3 weeks old. In general, <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> the top of the plant had a higher activity than <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> the bottom of the plant. A much greater activity was found in soybean leaves than in soybean roots. The absence of sulfate in the nutrient solution resulted in higher enzyme activity in <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> young plants and in lower activity in <b>leaves</b> <b>from</b> older plants. Over the growing season, however, ATP sulfurylase activity appeared to be related to sulfur content of the leaf. Several other plant species also had measurable levels of ATP sulfurylase...|$|R

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick <b>leave</b> <b>from</b> Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily Newsâ€”one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E

She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's <b>leave</b> <b>from</b> operations, returning to action on 23 December.|$|E

5|$|During {{her years}} in Minneapolis, Hickok {{lived with a}} society {{reporter}} named Ella Morse, {{with whom she had}} an eight-year relationship. In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse persuaded her take a year's <b>leave</b> <b>from</b> the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok could write a novel. At the beginning of the leave, however, Morse unexpectedly eloped with an ex-boyfriend, leaving Hickok devastated. Unable to face a return to Minneapolis, Hickok moved to New York, landing a job with the New York Daily Mirror.|$|E

Arrington easily completed the coursework and examinations, as {{he had already been}} teaching much of the material, and published several articles in the meantime.|$|E

An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they <b>leave</b> <b>from</b> savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
