As a well is drilled, the bit passes through various formations, each with different characteristics. The deeper the hole, the more baryte is needed {{as a percentage of the}} total mud mix. An additional benefit of baryte is that it is non-magnetic and thus does not interfere with magnetic measurements taken in the borehole, either during <b>logging-while-drilling</b> or in separate drill hole logging. Baryte used for drilling petroleum wells can be black, blue, brown or gray depending on the ore body. The baryte is finely ground so that at least 97% of the material, by weight, can pass through a 200-mesh (75 μm) screen, and no more than 30%, by weight, can be less than 6 μm diameter. The ground baryte also must be dense enough so that its specific gravity is 4.2 or greater, soft enough to not damage the bearings of a tricone drill bit, chemically inert, and containing no more than 250 milligrams per kilogram of soluble alkaline salts. In August 2010 API (American Petroleum Institute) published specifications to modify the 4.2 drilling grade standards for baryte to include 4.1 SG materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Electrical <b>logging-while-drilling</b> (LWD) {{tools are}} {{commonly}} used in {{oil and gas exploration}} to estimate the conductivity (resistivity) of adjacent earth media. In general, earth media exhibit anisotropic conductivities. This implies that when LWD tools are used for deviated and horizontal drilling, the resulting borehole problem may include dipping-layered media with dipping beds having full 3 × 3 conductivity tensors. To model this problem, we describe a 3 -D cylindrical finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) algorithm extended to fully anisotropic conductive media and implemented with cylindrical perfectly matched layers to mimic open-domain problems. The 3 -D FDTD algorithm is validated against analytical results in simple formations, showing good agreement, and used to simulate the response of LWD tools through anisotropic dipping beds for various values of anisotropic conductivities and dipping angles.

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{discrete}} wavenumber method, {{we examine the}} effects on <b>Logging-While-Drilling</b> (LWD) logs when a mismatch exists between the amplitudes or generating times of the signals from individual monopoles in a LWDmultipole source. An amplitude-mismatched LWD dipole/quadrupole source produces non-dipole/non-quadrupole modes as well as flexural and screw modes. The strongest of non-dipole/non-quadrupole modes is the Stoneley mode, whose amplitude increases with increasing mismatch. However, we can recover the flexural mode signals by A-C processing, and the screw mode by A-B+C-D processing, respectively. The Stoneley mode, which has the same amplitude at the same radial distance from the borehole axis, is cancelled out by A-C and A-B+C-D processing {{as long as the}} tool is placed at the centre of theborehole. The responses froma time-mismatchedLWDmultipole source look like the summationof responsesby two or four monopole sources off the borehole axis. However, we can avoid the misinterpretation of the formation velocities by referring to the computed dispersion curves, which are independent of the arrival times of the modes, on the frequency semblance plot.

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{wavenumber}} integration, velocity-time semblance, and dispersion methods to investigate the influence of collar properties including velocities, density, and attenuation on acoustic <b>logging-while-drilling</b> wavefields. We have found that when the velocities of the collar wave and the P-wave of the formation are similar, they interfere. However, the interference disappears when the velocity difference increases. Having a collar with large velocities (especial large shear velocity) and density makes the direct P-velocity determination possible in a fast formation even without isolators. For a slow formation, the interference of the collar flexural wave with the formation flexural and leaky P-waves is slight for a dipole tool when collar velocities are large. For this case, the S velocity can {{be determined by the}} flexural formation wave at low frequency (approximately 2 kHz). Based on these observations, we propose that the measurement of the P- and S-velocities can be easier if the collar is made of an advanced composite material that has high compressional and shear velocities as well as density. This is a direct and easy change to implement and a new idea for an acoustic <b>logging-while-drilling</b> tool design...|$|E

Several techniques are applied to the FDTD algorithm to improve the computational efficiency and the modeling accuracy of more arbitrary geometries/media in well-logging problems: 1) a 3 -D FDTD cylindrical grid to avoid staircasing discretization errors in the transmitter, receiver, and mandrel geometries; 2) an anisotropic-medium (unsplit) perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition in cylindrical coordinates {{is applied to the}} FDTD algorithm, leading to more compact grids and reduced memory requirements; a simple and efficient algorithm is employed to extract frequency-domain data (phase and amplitude) from early-time FDTD data; 4) permittivity scaling is applied to overcome the Courant limit of FDTD and allow faster simulations of lower frequency tool; and 5) two locally conformal FDTD (LC-FDTD) techniques are applied to better {{simulate the}} response of logging tools in eccentric boreholes. We validate the FDTD results against the numerical mode matching method for problems where the latter is applicable, and against pseudoanalytical results for eccentric borehole problems. The comparisons show very good agreement. Results from 3 -D borehole problems involving eccentric tools and dipping beds simultaneously are also included to demonstrate the robustness of the method.

Consequently, {{the influence of}} mud invasion becomes too difficult to ascertain such that high water saturation is estimated from the low-resistivity reading (Souvick 2003). One of the techniques proposed to tackle deep invasion problem is running resistivity <b>logging-while-drilling</b> (LWD) since LWD time is less compared to its wireline equivalent (Boyd et al. 1995). Obeidi et al. (2010) proposed to use pulsed neutron capture (PNC) to evaluate LRP reservoirs. This technique uses chlorine to control the rate of capture of the thermal neutron in the formation. However, the proposed suggestion may not be suitable as the technique is hampered by shallow depth of investigation. Similarly, LRP intervals are created by open fractures (either induced or natural) where high saline muds from the wellbore can easily penetrate through the fractures (Asquith 1985).

The term LWD encompasses equipment and techniques for real-time data transmission from within the well to the earth’s surface detectors (Shi et al. 2004). LWD systems are responsible for making various downhole measurements and transmits the collected information to the surface for display, interpretation and immediate use (Shao et al. 2017). In today’s drilling, mud pulse telemetry (MPT) system is the common low-cost technology that provides reliable two-way real-time data transmission between the wellbore downhole system and the surface receiver (Hutin et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2007). For more than a decade, MPT has gained advantages in downhole data transmission technology that includes the downhole mud pulse generator and ground signal detection and extraction system (Su et al. 2011). Proper well conditioning, navigation, and feedback control for real-time target relocation requires more sophisticated technical solutions to improve drilling efficiency, safety, and best scoping of the best hydrocarbon production zones.

This thesis is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the electric field induced by the multipole LWD {{acoustic wave}}. The main goal of this thesis is to understand the mechanism in the seismoelectric conversion under the LWD geometry and prove {{the absence of the}} tool mode in the LWD-acoustic-wave induced electric signals. In this experimental study, we measured the seismoelectric signals excited by an acoustic multipole source in the scaled <b>logging-while-drilling</b> model. We put the scaled tool in a sandstone borehole to perform LWD seismoelectric and acoustic measurements. Monopole and dipole acoustic and the induced electric signals were recorded separately under exactly the same settings. The recorded acoustic and seismoelectric signals were analyzed in both time and frequency domains using a semblance method. We found no tool mode components in the electric signals by examining both the waveforms and the time and frequency domain semblances. (cont.) The underlying mechanism is the electric double layer (EDL) at the steel water interface is much weaker than the one at the formation water interface. Thus, in the LWD seismoelectric signal, there should be no component with an apparent velocity of tool mode. Since only formation acoustic modes have their corresponding components in the electric signal, we calculated the coherence of the two kinds of signals in the frequency domain. By applying the coherence curve to filter the acoustic signals, we can eliminate the tool modes and pick out the formation acoustic modes. In the theoretical study, we developed a Pride-theory-based model for the LWD-acoustic-wave induced electric field. The electric field strength is calculated at the electrode positions along the borehole wall, analogous to what was done in the experiment. The electric boundary conditions, which are the continuity of the electric field at the borehole wall and disappearance at the LWD tool surface, reveal the underlying mechanism in the LWD seismoelectric conversion which is also the basis of our lab experiment. The absence of the tool modes in the synthetic waveforms of the electric field coincides with what we have observed in the experimental study. (cont.)

However, hydrous minerals affect porosity measurements, and accounting for them is essential toward defining the interstitial porosity truly representative of the compaction state. The water content of sediments was measured in core samples and estimated from logging data using a resistivity model for shale. We used the cation exchange capacity to correct the porosity data {{for the amount of}} water bound to clay minerals and to correct the porosity estimates for the surface conductivity of hydrous minerals. The results indicate that several apparent porosity anomalies are significantly reduced by this correction, implying that they are in part artifacts from hydrous minerals. The correction also improves the fit of porosity estimated from <b>logging-while-drilling</b> (LWD) resistivity data to porosity measured on cores. Low overall porosities at the toe of the accretionary wedge and in the splay fault area are best explained by erosion, and we estimated the quantity of sediments eroded within the splay fault area by comparing porosity-effective stress relationships of the sediments to a reference curve. Additionally, a comparison of LWD data with core data (resistivity and P wave velocity) obtained at Site C 0001 landward of the mega-splay fault area, suggested a contribution from the fracture porosity to in situ properties on the formation...|$|E
40|$|International Ocean Discovery Program IODP has {{extensively}} {{used the}} D/V Chikyu to drill the Kumano {{portion of the}} Nankai Trough. (IODP) Expeditions 338 and 348 of the NanTroSEIZE project drilled deep into the inner accretionary prism south of the Kii Peninsula collecting a suite of LWD data, including natural gamma ray, electrical resistivity logs and borehole images, suitable to characterize structures (fractures and faults) inside the accretionary prism. Both expeditions drilled into the accretionary prism at Site C 0002 : Hole C 0002 F (Expedition 338) was drilled down to 2004. 5 mbsf, Hole C 0002 P (Expedition 348) reached a depth of 3058. 8 mbsf. Structural interpretation and analysis of <b>logging-while-drilling</b> data in the deep inner prism revealed intense deformation of a generally homogenous bedding that dips steeply and are intersected by faults and fractures. The interpretation of the images of both Hole C 0002 F and Hole C 0002 P reveals distinct areas of intense fracturing and faulting within a very clay-dominated lithology. Faults are undobutedly interpreted on C 0002 P images. The relationship between fractures, faults and the changes in clay mineralogy from cutting sample analyses is analyzed to characterize potential connection between these features in the accretionary prismM.

40|$|Downhole {{acoustic}} {{data were}} acquired in very low-velocity, hydrate-bearing formations at five sites drilled on the Cascadia Margin during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 311. P-wave velocity in marine sediments typically increases with depth as porosity decreases because of compaction. In general, Vp increases from ~ 1. 6 at the seafloor to ~ 2. 0 km/s ~ 300 m below seafloor at these sites. Gas hydrate-bearing intervals appear as high-velocity anomalies over this trend because solid hydrates stiffen the sediment. <b>Logging-while-drilling</b> (LWD) sonic technology, however, is challenged to recover accurate P-wave velocity in shallow sediments where velocities are low and approach the fluid velocity. Low formation Vp make {{the analysis of}} LWD sonic data difficult because of the strong effects of leaky-P wave modes, which typically have high amplitudes and are dispersive. We examine the frequency dispersion of borehole leaky-P modes and establish a minimum depth (approx 50 - 100 m) below the seafloor at each site where Vp can be accurately estimated using LWD data. Below this depth, Vp estimates from LWD sonic data compare well with wireline sonic logs and VSP interval velocities in nearby holes, but differ in detail due to local heterogeneity. We derive hydrate saturation using published models and the best estimate of Vp at these sites and compare results with independent resistivity-derived saturations...|$|E
40|$|The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is {{designed}} to investigate fault mechanics and seismogenesis along a subduction megathrust, with objectives that include characterizing fault slip, strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughout an active plate boundary system. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 338 was planned to extend and case riser Hole C 0002 F from 856 to 3600 meters below the seafloor (m b. s. f.). Riser operations extended the hole to 2005. 5 m b. s. f., collecting <b>logging-while-drilling</b> (LWD) and measurement-while-drilling, mud gas, and cuttings data. Results reveal two lithologic units within the inner wedge of the accretionary prism that are separated by a prominent fault zone at ~ 1640 m b. s. f. Due to damage to the riser during unfavorable winds and strong currents, riser operations were suspended, and Hole C 0002 F left for re-entry during future riser drilling operations. Contingency riserless operations included coring at the forearc basin site (C 0002) and at two slope basin sites (C 0021 and C 0022), and LWD at one input site (C 0012) and at three slope basin sites (C 0018, C 0021 and C 0022). Cores and logs from these sites comprehensively characterize the alteration stage of the oceanic basement input to the subduction zone, the early stage of Kumano Basin evolution, gas hydrates in the forearc basin, and recent activity of the shallow megasplay fault zone system and associated submarine landslides...|$|E
40|$|A jointly {{developed}} logging-while-coring {{system was}} deployed and tested during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 204 on Hydrate Ridge {{off the coast}} of Oregon. The system consists of two existing devices modified to be used together — a Schlumberger Resistivity-at-Bit ™ tool and a Texas A&M University wireline-retrieved core barrel and latching tool. This combined approach will allow for precise core-log depth calibration and core orientation within a single borehole, and without at pipe trip, providing both time saving and unique scientific advantages. This successful test during Leg 204 marks the first simultaneous use of coring and <b>logging-while-drilling</b> technologies. The test was conducted in 788. 5 m water depth at the crest of southern Hydrate Ridge (Site 1249) in July 2002. Eight cores were recovered from Hole 1249 B with 32. 9 % recovery, on average, through a 45 m interval and as high as 67. 8 % in one core. All eight cores were processed and archived normally on board the D/V JOIDES Resolution. High quality logs and image data were recorded in the downhole tool memory over the entire 74. 9 m drilled interval. The log data were processed post-cruise and correlated to recordings of conventional logs in nearby Hole 1249 A. The logging while coring system will be deployed in harder formations with higher resistivities at future Ocean Drilling Program sites in 2003. It is expected that the logging-while-coring systems will be utilized more routinely at such locations, where rig time constraints may otherwise preclude coring in difficult drilling environments...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThis {{paper will}} present an {{overview}} of the applications of the measurements performed by the Measurement-While-Drilling and <b>Logging-While-Drilling</b> tools. An evaluation of the available telemetry techniques used to transfer the measured data from the downhole tools to surface are performed, with special emphasis on Mud-Pulse Telemetry (MPT) and Wired-Pipe Telemetry (WPT). MPT is by far the method most commonly used on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. WPT is a new technology that allows a vast amount of data to be transferred, which could create new features for the MWD/LWD service, and improve on others. The paper give {{an overview of}} the current procedures applied during downhole communication with MPT, and explore the changes that could be introduced by utilizing WPT. It is shown that WPT would allow several new applications of the downhole measurements, without the same problems transferring data as MPT. WPT {{do not have the same}} proven record of high reliability as MPT. Hence, MPT is probably going to remain the preferred telemetry method in the future. The paper explores the possibility to integrate the downhole measurements into a drilling control system. It gives an example from Managed Pressure Drilling where this already has been successfully utilized, and explore different other scenarios where an integration is possible. To fully be able to exploit the downhole data, the amount of data received would need to be high. If utilized in an automation system, the driller would need to fully understand how the system works, and be given the means to override the automation system if necessary...|$|E
