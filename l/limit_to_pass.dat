5000|$|Players have 30 {{lives to}} run through bullet hell levels. When the player dies or voluntarily ends the run, the player can view and rewind their timestream to revisit {{the life of a}} prior player-character's run or {{otherwise}} restart with a new run. [...] There are over 16 different characters in each of the 6 stages with different weapons or powers of their own. In addition, the player can also use items like [...] "cloxs" [...] (clock items that reverse the time limit), shards (violet dust-like pixels that allow the player and the game's time <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> in slow motion; they are only visible if the player uses the [...] "Time Out" [...] mechanic) and [...] "glorbs" [...] (yellow diamond shaped items that increase the player's number of lives by one, and are found on every level on certain areas or in enemies that are difficult to capture). Both shards and glorbs can be collected to unlock a new character when a certain amount is obtained.|$|E
50|$|The {{player can}} choose from more than 30 dinosaurs to place into the park, {{including}} Brachiosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, and Velociraptor. In order to obtain these dinosaurs, the player must expand the park by cutting down the surrounding jungle area and clearing away the debris left behind. One piece of debris will contain a piece of amber, which the player must invest money into decoding. Once fully decoded, a dinosaur will be revealed and be ready for purchase. Most dinosaurs can be bought with the coins earnable ingame, but certain dinosaurs can only be purchased with special Bucks. Only one individual of each dinosaur species can be placed into the park, although smaller ones live in pairs. When the dinosaur is placed into the park, it starts out as an egg. The player must wait on the corresponding time <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{in order for the}} dinosaur to hatch or spends Bucks. When the dinosaur hatches, it will begin to generate money for the player to collect. Carnivores are kept in cages, while herbivores are not confined.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the use of}} {{mathematical}} model is very influential on students’ study outcomes and activity. In deciding the mathematical model, teacher should consider students’ characteristic, the material, and also the students’ habits. So far, mathematics teacher of class VIII E SMP Negeri I Banyubiru Kabupaten Semarang tend to use the method of lecture and mechanistic structural because he {{feel that this is}} the easiest method for the students to digest. Furthermore, the teacher only uses props on materials that are considered hard. This style of teaching from the teacher has an impact on students. Students tend to be passive when lecture is in process resulting in less student activity and also minimum result on their study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{directed against}} the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been approved {{for the treatment of}} patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) that do not carry KRAS mutations. Therefore, KRAS testing has become mandatory to chose the most appropriate therapy for these patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to guarantee the possibility for mCRC patients to receive an high quality KRAS testing in every Italian region, the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) and the Italian Society of Pathology and Cytopathology -Italian division of the International Academy of Pathology (SIAPEC-IAP) started a program to improve KRAS testing. AIOM and SIAPEC identified a large panel of Italian medical oncologists, pathologists and molecular biologists that outlined guidelines for KRAS testing in mCRC patients. These guidelines include specific information on the target patient population, the biological material for molecular analysis, the extraction of DNA, and the methods for the mutational analysis that are summarized in this paper. Following the publication of the guidelines, the scientific societies started an external quality assessment scheme for KRAS testing. Five CRC specimens with known KRAS mutation status were sent to the 59 centers that participated to the program. The samples were validated by three referral laboratories. The participating laboratories were allowed to use their own preferred method for DNA extraction and mutational analysis and were asked to report the results within 4 weeks. The <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the quality assessment was set at 100 % of true responses. In the first round, only two centers did not pass (3 %). The two centers were offered to participate to a second round and both centers failed again to pass. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this first Italian quality assessment for KRAS testing suggest that KRAS mutational analysis is performed with good quality in the majority of Italian centers...|$|E

40|$|Wireless links play an {{important}} role in the last mile network connectivity. In contrast to the strictly centralized approach of today's wireless systems, the future promises decentralization of network management. Nodes potentially engage in localized grouping and organization based on their neighborhood to carry out complex goals such as end-to-end communication. The quadratic energy dissipation of the wireless medium necessitates the presence of certain relay nodes in the network. Conventionally, the role of such relays is <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> messages in a chain in a point-point hopping architecture. With the decentralization, multiple nodes could potentially interfere with each other. This work proposes a technique to exploit the presence of relays in a way that mitigates interference between the network nodes.

40|$|Abstract. Linearizability is a {{commonly}} accepted notion of correctness for li-braries of concurrent algorithms.
