5|$|In June 1835, Friedrich {{suffered}} {{his first}} stroke, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced {{his ability to}} paint. As a result, {{he was unable to}} work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.|$|E
5|$|Nash played 17 {{games for}} South in 1945, kicking 56 goals. This <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> 99 VFL matches and 246 goals in his career. Nash also played three matches for Victoria, kicking 19 goals.|$|E
5|$|Red Szell {{became the}} first blind person to climb the Old Man, despite {{suffering}} from retinitis pigmentosa that <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> 5 per cent vision. With assistance from Martin Moran and Nick Carter, he scaled the stack in 2013.|$|E

Considering that she 'ad only just buried her 'usband, Rupert found her quite skittish enough, and he couldn't 'elp {{wondering}} wot she'd be like when she'd got over her grief a bit more.|$|R
5|$|Thorne's various cases <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a new {{interest}} in the law. He pursued a degree at the University of Richmond School of Law, graduating in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{abilities}} in the Test match theatre {{during his career}} of 17 years and 216 days have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a number of Test cricket records. He is the seventh most capped player for England in Tests, and has the sixth highest career runs total in Tests for an England player, 8114. He was the fourteenth quickest player to reach 8,000 runs, taking 190 innings.|$|E
5|$|Abbe was {{involved}} in a car accident in 1960 which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> severe neck injuries that had lasting effects on his health. While the precise date is unclear, Abbe had been promoted to 8th dan by late 1960. Independent sources from the late 1960s include this rank with his name. In addition to his ranks in judo, aikido, and kendo, he held the rank of 5th dan in karate and dan ranks in kyūdō and jūkendō.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} words, {{followed}} by three cheers, with which his friends parted from <b>him,</b> and <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone <b>with</b> the captain.|$|R

5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|He joined South Australia part {{way through}} the 193536 season, and in March 1936, he scored a century (121) on his {{first-class}} cricket debut against Tasmania at the Adelaide Oval. This was to be his only match of the season, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a debut season average of 121.00. At {{the start of his}} first full season, he followed this up with scores of 16 and four against the touring England team and Victoria and seven and 19 against New South Wales. On Christmas Day, 1936, however, he scored his second first-class century, 104 against Queensland in the first innings. He would go on to score 52 in the second.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{followed}} {{his father and}} grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. While McCain was on a bombing mission over Hanoi in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was {{a prisoner of war}} until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. The wounds that he sustained during war have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> lifelong physical disabilities.|$|E
60|$|The {{door slammed}} violently and <b>left</b> <b>him</b> exchanging grins <b>with</b> Mr. Jobson.|$|R

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's illness <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a {{permanent}} stutter {{and he gave}} up any thoughts of entering the ministry at that time. In preparation for joining a relative in trade in Lisbon, he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to Aramaic, and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, natural philosophy, logic, and metaphysics through the works of Isaac Watts, Willem 's Gravesande, and John Locke.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} won by Australian driver Will Power for Team Penske. Power {{was making his}} race return after an {{incident}} during a practice session at the 2009 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma, which <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> two broken vertebrae in his back. Second place went to Ryan Hunter-Reay, who was making his first start for Andretti Autosport, and third place went to another returnee, A. J. Foyt Enterprises' Vitor Meira. Meira was making his first start since suffering similar injuries to Power, during the 2009 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
50|$|In May 1992 Drake was {{evicted from}} his rental home by his landlord, Andrew Zatko, for not paying his rent for several months, whereupon his common-law wife <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> {{together}} <b>with</b> their infant daughter.|$|R
60|$|It was a mournful-looking {{superintendent}} Bob {{made when}} his partners had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone <b>with</b> {{the officer who}} was acting as keeper of the property Massie had attached in pursuance of his swindling scheme.|$|R

5|$|Though {{this routine}} made his play {{air-tight}} in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length... {{he could have}} made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing {{as a candidate for}} the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
25|$|Jean des Esseintes is {{the last}} member of a {{powerful}} and once proud noble family. He has lived an extremely decadent life in Paris, which has <b>left</b> <b>him</b> disgusted <b>with</b> human society. Without telling anyone, he retreats to {{a house in the}} countryside.|$|R

6000|$|Mercy glanced distrustfully at Ignatius Wetzel. He {{was again}} absorbed in his endless {{examination}} of the body on the bed. If she <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone <b>with</b> Mr. Holmcroft, there was no knowing what the hateful old man might not say of her. She answered: ...|$|R
5|$|In 1968–69, Greaves scored 27 {{goals in}} 42 league games to finish as the First Division's leading scorer {{for the sixth}} and final time. He scored four of his goals in one match against Sunderland, and also scored hat-tricks against Burnley and Leicester City. His nine goals in cup competitions, {{including}} a hat-trick against Exeter City, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> an overall goal tally of 36 in 52 games. Spurs performed inconsistently in the 1969–70 season, and Greaves was dropped from the first team after playing in an FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 28 January 1970. He was never recalled to the starting line-up, but still ended the season as the club's joint top scorer (with Martin Chivers), having scored 11 goals in 33 matches.|$|E
5|$|In November, Fowler {{travelled}} to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, {{a specialist}} sports injuries doctor, {{to try and}} resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However {{he went on to}} suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Negus {{served in}} the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war. He {{initially}} deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches {{on the front line}} with a machine-gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres. The effects of explosives during this period <b>left</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> tinnitus. This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges. In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the 3rd (Lahore) Division (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. As one of those who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the Mons Star. His service in the RAMC ended in 1919.|$|E
60|$|At the notary's gate Tonelli {{would have}} said good-night, but the signora made <b>him</b> enter <b>with</b> them, and then {{abruptly}} <b>left</b> <b>him</b> standing <b>with</b> the Paronsina in the gallery, while she was heard hurrying away to her own apartment. She reappeared, extending toward Tonelli both hands, upon which glittered and glittered manifold skeins of the delicate chain of Venice.|$|R

60|$|He did not reply. So {{often she}} did not take his meaning, but <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone <b>with</b> his sense of tragedy. She {{had no idea how}} his life was {{wrenched}} from its roots, and when he tried to tell her, she balked him, leaving him inwardly quite lonely.|$|R
