50|$|Luna E-1 No.2, {{sometimes}} {{identified by}} NASA as Luna 1958B, was a Soviet spacecraft which {{was lost in}} a <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> in 1958. It was a 361 kg Luna E-1 spacecraft, the second of four to be launched, {{all of which were}} involved in <b>launch</b> <b>failures.</b> It was intended to impact the surface of the Moon, and in doing so become the first man-made object to reach its surface.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle breakup {{analysis}} has been performed for missions that may carry nuclear fuel for heating or power purposes to assess nuclear safety {{in case of}} <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> leading to atmospheric reentry. Also, failure scenarios exist {{which could lead to}} breakup during Entry / Descent / Landing (EDL) at Mars due to off-nominal entries, with implications for planetary protection requirements. Since the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft may include a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), an analysis of breakup in case of <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> is required. Also, breakup during Mars EDL due to off-nominal entries could release the RTG heat source that has implications for planetary protection requirements. This paper presents a methodology of MSL breakup analysis for <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> with application to Mars off-nominal entry...|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the second}} <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> caused by a Briz-M within twelve months as Ekspress-AM4 was lost in August 2011 due to a {{computer}} error. Other recent <b>launch</b> <b>failures</b> included three GLONASS satellites in 2011 and Mars probe Fobos-Grunt. All Proton-M launches were suspended and all Briz-M stages were recalled. This triggered discussion on {{the crisis in the}} Russian space industry with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev quoted as saying [...] "We are losing authority and billions of rubles" [...] due to the frequent <b>launch</b> <b>failures.</b> Medvedev chaired a meeting on the issue on 14 August 2012 and President Vladimir Putin had a meeting on organisational issues. One of the suggestions is that Roscosmos could be transformed into a corporation similar to Rosatom.|$|R

50|$|S-45A was an American {{satellite}}, {{which was}} lost in a <b>launch</b> <b>failure</b> in 1961. The satellite was intended to operate in a highly elliptical orbit, from which {{it was to have}} provided data on the shape of the ionosphere, and on the Earth's magnetic field. It was part of the Explorer programme, and would have been designated Explorer 12 had it reached orbit. It was the second of two identical satellites to be launched; the first, S-45, had also been lost in a <b>launch</b> <b>failure,</b> earlier in the year.|$|R
