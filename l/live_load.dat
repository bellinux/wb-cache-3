25|$|Three {{kinds of}} forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the <b>live</b> <b>load,</b> and the dynamic load. Dead load {{refers to the}} weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a {{tendency}} to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. <b>Live</b> <b>load</b> refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.|$|E
25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the <b>live</b> <b>load</b> of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E

25|$|The load a {{skyscraper}} experiences {{is largely}} from {{the force of the}} building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the dead load, the load of the structure, is larger than the <b>live</b> <b>load,</b> the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The Empire State Building's setbacks are actually a result of the building code at the time (1916 Zoning Resolution), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, John Hancock Center's shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the bridge differs {{slightly}} from other bridges, which are of <b>live</b> <b>load</b> composite construction. The difference is in the dead load design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the intermediate trestle. The deck is designed with a grid structure of girders. One set of girders are {{at the end and}} another set in the middle, which are braced by girders spaced on an average at [...] centre to centre.|$|E

[...] He was very active professionally and also served on the councils of the Institution of Naval Architects, Institution of Structural Engineers and the Institution of Waterworks Engineers; he was an Institution of Mechanical Engineers honorary member. [...] Inglis was also a {{prolific}} writer, publishing 25 books and academic papers {{on a wide range of}} engineering topics. [...] He received the ICE's Telford Medal in 1924 for a paper entitled The Theory of Transverse Oscillations in Girders and its Relation to <b>Live</b> <b>Load</b> and Impact Allowance. [...] In 1926, he was appointed to a Royal Commission considering cross-river traffic in London with particular reference to the Waterloo and St Paul's bridges. [...] Inglis founded the Cambridge Engineers' Association to promote social activities at the University, and saw Sir Charles Parsons appointed as its first president in 1929. [...] In the same year, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Edinburgh.|$|E

Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each load type {{in order to ensure}} the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios. For example, in designing a staircase, a dead load factor may be 1.2 times the weight of the structure, and a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> factor may be 1.6 times the maximum expected <b>live</b> <b>load.</b> These two [...] "factored loads" [...] are combined (added) to determine the [...] "required strength" [...] of the staircase.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, the Faun {{plants were}} {{destroyed}} {{to a large}} extent. In 1946, manufacturing began again, first using pre-war and war designs. In 1948, the first new post-war design {{was introduced to the}} market: a small 4.5t truck with diesel engine with an output of between 90 and 100HP. In 1949, the L7 model was introduced providing a load-carrying capacity of 6.5t and a 150HP engine by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz. Tractors were also built1. The L7 was available as traditional American-style truck and as cabover. From 1951 and 1950, the L8 (180HP and 8t <b>live</b> <b>load)</b> and Sepp (130HP and 6.5-7t <b>live</b> <b>load)</b> models replaced the former Faun models. From 1953 on, the triple-axle L900 truck was built, a vehicle for operating on difficult and heavy construction sites. The L900 could carry up to 16 tons. The L8 and the L900 models were produced until 1962, the Sepp until 1955. In 1955, modernised models with a new identifier system came to the market (F55, F56, F64, F66, F68), with a <b>live</b> <b>load</b> capacity of 4.5 to 5.6t. In 1955, Faun acquired a light Cab Over Engine from the Ostner plants for its own delivery programme which underwent a technical overhaul in 1957 and was built until 1968. From 1956 onwards, heavy trucks and tractor units were added to the programme, which were also available with four-wheel drive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Live</b> <b>loads,</b> or imposed loads, are temporary, {{of short}} duration, or a moving load. These dynamic loads may involve {{considerations}} such as impact, momentum, vibration, slosh dynamics of fluids and material fatigue.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of loads that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of <b>load</b> is <b>Live</b> <b>Loads</b> which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> like building loads, highway bridge Loads, railroad bridge Loads, impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.|$|R
50|$|Buildings will {{be subject}} to loads from various sources. The {{principal}} ones can be classified as <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> (loads which are not always present in the structure), dead loads (loads which are permanent and immovable excepting redesign or renovation) and wind load, as described below. In some cases structures may be subject to other loads, such as those due to earthquakes or pressures from retained material. The expected maximum magnitude of each {{is referred to as the}} characteristic load.|$|R
