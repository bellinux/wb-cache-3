40|$|Error {{detection}} is {{a technique}} that enables reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels. Many communication channels are subject to channel noise, and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver. Basically error detection mechanism contains various methods but LRC and CRC are {{the most commonly used}} methods. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (<b>LRC)</b> is a form of redundancy check that is applied independently to each of a parallel group of bit streams. A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) {{is one of the most}} powerful redundancies checking technique. The problem is user knows these concepts of the LRC and CRC techniques while reading the text book but they don’t know practically how LRC and CRC techniques are working...|$|E

50|$|In <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking</b> and cyclic <b>redundancy</b> <b>checking,</b> {{block check}} {{characters}} are computed for, and added to, each message block transmitted.

50|$|Many {{protocols}} use an XOR-based <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> byte (often called {{block check}} character or BCC), including the serial line internet protocol (SLIP),the IEC 62056-21 standard for electrical-meter reading, smart cards {{as defined in}} ISO/IEC 7816, and the ACCESS.bus protocol.|$|R
5000|$|Modbus ASCII — This {{is used in}} serial {{communication}} and makes use of ASCII characters for protocol communication. The ASCII format uses a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> checksum. Modbus ASCII messages are framed by leading colon (":") and trailing newline (CR/LF).|$|R
50|$|Checksum schemes include parity bits, <b>check</b> digits, and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>checks.</b> Some {{checksum}} schemes, {{such as the}} Damm algorithm, the Luhn algorithm, and the Verhoeff algorithm, {{are specifically}} designed to detect errors commonly introduced by humans in writing down or remembering identification numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adjective}} [...] "transverse" [...] is {{most often}} used when it is used in combination with additional error control coding, such as a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check.</b> Although parity alone can only detect and not correct errors, it {{can be part of}} a system for correcting errors.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>Redundancy</b> <b>Check</b> byte was {{the only}} {{character}} that could have other than four one bits. This byte contains a zero in each bit position where the data record contained an even number of one bits, and one where an odd number. [...] "Idle characters and control sequences {{are not included in}} the LRS.|$|R
50|$|A normal block ending {{character}} (ETB or ETX) {{is followed}} by a check sum (block check character or BCC). For USASCII, this is a one character <b>longitudinal</b> <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (LRC); for Transcode and EBCDIC, the check sum is a two character cyclic redundancy check(CRC). A data frame may contain an intermediate check sum preceded by an ITB character. This ability to include intermediate check sums in a long data frame allows a considerable improvement of the error detection probability. USASCII characters are also transmitted using odd parity for additional checking.|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{transverse}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> (TRC) or vertical <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> is a <b>redundancy</b> <b>check</b> for synchronized parallel bits applied {{once per}} bit time, across the bit streams.
