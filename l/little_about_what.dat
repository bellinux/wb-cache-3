Lucy Duff-Gordon noted that for the rest of her husband's life he was brokenhearted over the negative coverage by the [...] "yellow press", during his cross-examination at the inquiry. The final report by the inquiry determined that the Duff-Gordons did not deter the crew from any attempt at rescue through bribery or any other method of coercion.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management {{collaboration}} would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events. [...] He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved. [...] Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. [...] In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, [...] "We know very <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we profess to know. We have claimed too much as a profession." [...] He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the role of the}} medical director in what North Americans call EMS, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of precisely how EMS systems (or ambulance service, SAMU, SMURD, etc.) operate in various locales. [...] There is <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we call EMS that is universally applicable. [...] Instead, communities and medical practitioners tend to develop systemic arrangements that are based on an assessment of local need. In the delivery of what we commonly refer to as EMS in various countries, there are two major service delivery models, with a number of minor models or variations from the main models. [...] The first model, and arguably the oldest, is generally described as the Franco-German model. This model is physician-led, and places those operating ambulances into what are in many cases, minor, supporting roles. While this model is generally referred to as Franco-German, this may be something of a misnomer, since there is ample evidence and documentation indicating that {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, many North American hospital-based ambulances in larger centres were actually staffed by ambulance surgeons; physicians who actually responded in the ambulance and provided care in a manner which very much resembles the current Franco-German model. [...] In the French version of the model, only physicians and nurses perform advanced care, and drivers have only minimal medical training.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to providing oral testimony, Manstein helped prepare a 132-page document presented at Nuremberg in August 1946. The myth that the Wehrmacht was [...] "clean"—not culpable for {{the events of the}} Holocaust—arose {{partly as a result of}} this document, written largely by Manstein, along with General of Cavalry Siegfried Westphal. Manstein's oral testimony included material about the Einsatzgruppen, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the concept of military obedience, especially as related to the Commissar Order, an order issued by Hitler in 1941 requiring all Soviet political commissars to be shot without trial. Manstein admitted that he received the order, but said he did not carry it out. Documents from 1941 presented at Nuremberg and at Manstein's own later trial contradict this claim: he received regular reports throughout that summer regarding the execution of hundreds of political commissars. He denied any knowledge of the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, and testified that soldiers under his command were not involved in the murder of Jewish civilians. Otto Ohlendorf, commander of Einsatzgruppe D, contradicted this during his own testimony, saying that not only was Manstein aware of what was happening, but that Manstein's Eleventh Army was actively involved. While testifying at Nuremberg, Manstein claimed ignorance of what was happening in the concentration camps. He stated that as he was a thousand kilometres away, he knew <b>little</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was occurring there. One of his officers who had visited a camp had reported to him that the prisoners were criminals and political prisoners, who were being treated [...] "severely but correctly." [...] In September 1946 the General Staff and the OKW were declared to not be criminal organisations.|$|E
