The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became <b>leak-proof</b> so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E

He {{was sent to}} France in early 1940, once again with the {{temporary}} rank of lieutenant colonel, as Assistant Military Attaché for Air. [...] His mission was to observe Allied air operations {{during the early stages}} of World War II. As a result of his observations, he recommended many important changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics, including upgrading armament from [...]30 caliber to [...]50 caliber machine guns, and installing <b>leak-proof</b> fuel tanks, but his scathing comparisons of the German Luftwaffe with the Air Corps upset many officers. This resulted in his being sent back to Wright Field. In January 1941, he became commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School there, with the rank of brigadier general. He was promoted to major general on 26 March 1942, when he became commander of the Fourth Air Force, an air defense and training organization based in San Francisco. Kenney personally instructed pilots on how to handle the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and A-29 Hudson.|$|E

40|$|Shrub shelterbelt is an {{important}} element of man-made oasis ecosystems in arid northwestern China, where the ecological environment is fragile and blown sand is a serious hazard (Evans and Thames 1981, Zhang 1999). In the most part of the Hexi Corridor of China, surface and ground-water resources are often either unavailable or too saline and brackish for irrigation. Precipitation is the major water source for plant growth. Annual precipitation in this region ranges from 183. 6 to 157. 3 mm, with 70 % falling between June and September. Water availability is a crucial factor in the establishment of oasis ecosystems (Evans and Thames 1981, Zhang 1999). Furthermore, most sandy soils in this region have low wa-ter- and nutrient-retention capacities (Tao and Ren 2004, Zhou et al. 2007). Loss of water and nutrients from soil also influences revegetation process (Guo et al. 2007). Caragana korshinskii is a drought resistant shrub widely used for vegetation rehabilitation in arid regions of China as: (i) it facilitates transi-tion from shifting dune to sandy grassland; (ii) it helps restore soil nutrients by fixing atmospheric nitrogen; (iii) it can form shrub shelterbelts for farmland or artificial grassland; and (iv) it can serve as a supplementary source for livestock (Hansson et al. 1995). Due to scarce precipitation and dry climate, the establishment and growth of C. korshinskii is often impaired by water short-age (Li et al. 2006).

40|$|Opening roof cars {{can be used}} in {{transportation}} of a diversity of goods that require weather protection. Their operation allows us to fulfill the tasks of the Ministry of Railways that is to ensure both the qualitative and lossless transportation of various national economy and special loads and the significant improvement in the technical and economic indexes of the industry. Thus, there are three embodiment options of the opening roofs: single-leaf roof with axial of rotation along one car side; double-leaf roof with axial of rotation of its flaps along both car sides; single-leaf roof with axial of rotation along the car end wall. The work analyses and compares the first two options of the opening systems of the car roof. Analysis of various schemes of opening the roof-insulated cars is based on kinematic and force calculations. The paper defines how the changing length of hydraulic cylinders depends on the stroke and on the arm of applied force, depending on the opening roof angle for various embodiment options. To find the forces acting on the cylinders were determined the forces acting on the roof and the total applied moment of all the forces acting on them with respect to the axial of rotation. Thus, the total applied moment was considered to comprise the weighting unbalance moments of the roof and snow on it, as well as a moment of the force of wind acting on the roof (dead wind or downwind). Upon finding how the changing total moment of the force applied to the roof depends on the rotation angle and on the change of the applied force arm of hydraulic cylinders, the work determines the forces acting on the cylinders. The maximum tensile and compression force acting on the cylinders allows us to define their geometric characteristics such as piston stroke, diameter of the rod, piston-and rod-working cavity. Using a software package SADAS (developed at the Department "Rocket Launching Complexes" in BMSTU) the core models were built and designed for considered structural scheme to open a car roof with beam cross-sections and their dimensions for the roof designs under consideration assumed to be identical. Comparison of calculation results for various opening options has shown that a double-leaf roof car has a number of advantages as compared with that of the single-leaf roof. The double-leaf opening scheme allows us to use more compact and easy-to-implement hydraulic cylinders. With the double-leaf roof, a design of all power components of the car is under less loads, and therefore, in optimization of this design will be used the cross-sections of the power components of smaller area, thereby leading to reduced weight and size characteristics of the entire design. Tightness of the internal volume of the car with a double-leaf opening roof can be provided through using both the structural components to open the car roof and the cutting-edge <b>leak-proofing</b> and sealing materials...|$|R

50|$|Hermetic metal {{packaging}} began life in {{the vacuum}} tube industry, where a totally <b>leak-proof</b> housing was essential to operation. This industry developed the glass-seal electrical feedthrough, using alloys such as Kovar to match the coefficient of expansion of the sealing glass so as to minimize mechanical stress on the critical metal-glass bond as the tube warmed up. Some later tubes used metal cases and feedthroughs, and only the insulation around the individual feedthroughs used glass. Today, glass-seal packages are used mostly in critical components and assemblies for aerospace use, where leakage must be prevented even under extreme changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity.|$|E
