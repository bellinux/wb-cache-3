40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to statically balance the {{inherent}} elastic forces in linkages, this paper presents three techniques to statically balance a four-bar <b>linkage</b> <b>loaded</b> by a zero-free-length spring attached between its coupler point and an anchor point on the ground. The number of auxiliary links and balancing springs required for the three techniques is {{less than or equal to}} that of the only technique currently in the literature. One of the three techniques does not require auxiliary links. In these techniques, the set of values for the spring constants and the ground-anchor point of the balancing springs can vary over a one-parameter family. Thrice as many balancing choices are available when the cognates are considered. The ensuing numerous options enable a user to choose the most practical solution. To facilitate the evaluation of the balancing choices for all the cognates, Roberts-Chebyshev cognate theorem is extended to statically balanced four-bar linkages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint <b>linkage</b> <b>loaded</b> with linear springs or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are spring loads and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length load spring with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length spring load. If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length spring load. Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently, {{mutations}} in the valosin-containing protein gene (VCP) {{were found to}} be causative for a rare form of dementia [Watts GDJ, et al. : Nat Genet 2004; 36 : 377 - 381]. This gene lies within a region on the genome that has been linked to late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) [Myers A, et al. : Am J Med Genet 2002; 114 : 233 - 242]. In this study, we investigated whether variation within VCP could account for the <b>LOAD</b> <b>linkage</b> peak on chromosome 9. METHODS: We sequenced 188 individuals from the set of sibling pairs we had used to obtain the linkage results for chromosome 9 to look for novel polymorphisms that could explain the linkage signal. Any variant that was found was then typed in 2 additional sets of neuropathologically confirmed samples to look for associations with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: We found 2 variants when we sequenced VCP. One was a novel rare variant (R 92 H) and the other is already reported within the publicly available databases (rs 10972300). Neither explained the chromosome 9 <b>linkage</b> signal for <b>LOAD.</b> CONCLUSIONS: We have found a novel rare variant within the VCP gene, but we did not find a variant that could explain the <b>linkage</b> signal for <b>LOAD</b> on chromosome 9...|$|R

Conjugation of chitosan with TAT-peptide was therefore expected to produce a carrier with enhanced ability to facilitate cellular uptake.

40|$|To enhance new bone {{formation}} for the treating of patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis, various mechanical loading regimens have been developed. Although {{a wide spectrum of}} loading frequencies is proposed in those regimens, a potential <b>linkage</b> between <b>loading</b> frequencies and locations of loading-induced {{bone formation}} is not well understood. In this study, we addressed a question: Does mechanical resonance play a role in frequency-dependent bone formation? If so, can the locations of enhanced bone formation be predicted through the modes of vibration? Our hypothesis is that mechanical loads applied at a frequency near the resonant frequencies enhance bone formation, specifically in areas that experience high principal strains. To test the hypothesis, we conducted axial tibia loading using low, medium, or high frequency to the mouse tibia, as well as finite element analysis. The experimental data demonstrated dependence of the maximum bone formation on location and frequency of loading. Samples loaded with the low-frequency waveform exhibited peak enhancement of bone formation in the proximal tibia, while the high-frequency waveform offered the greatest enhancement in the midshaft and distal sections. Furthermore, the observed dependence on loading frequencies was correlated to the principal strains in the first five resonance modes at 8. 0 - 42. 9 Hz. Collectively, the results suggest that resonance is a contributor to the frequencies and locations of maximum bone formation. Further investigation of the observed effects of resonance may lead to the prescribing of personalized mechanical loading treatments...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder characterised by progressive memory impairment, a decline in language function {{and a variety of}} behavioural symptoms. The majority of AD cases have an age at onset above 65 years and exhibit no clear pattern of inheritance. The only known genetic risk factor this late onset AD, LOAD, is the [Special character omitted] 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene on chromosome 19. There is significant evidence of <b>linkage</b> to <b>LOAD</b> on chromosome 10 q 21 - 23. Therefore, nine candidate genes that map to this region were examined as susceptibility loci for the disease. In addition, a purely functional candidate, ADAM 12, was examined {{on the basis of its}} homology to α-secretase enzymes, 58, 752 basepairs of genomic sequence were screened by DHPLC, covering all exons, intron-exon boundaries and putative promoter regions, and 89 polymorphisms were detected. An additional 25 SNPs were identified from a SNP database. A two-stage strategy was employed. Variants were initially tested for association with AD by genotyping them in a small case-control sample, either in DNA pools or individually. Polymorphism showing a significant  difference between cases and controls were carried forward to the second stage and individually genotyped in a larger sample. A number of SNPs initially gave a positive result but after individual genotyping in a larger sample only 2 SNPs in the ADAM 12 gene showed evidence for association with LOAD.

The static transfer switch (STS) based on the thyristors is applied to improve the power quality and reliability.

40|$|Multi-phase motors {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the traditional three-phase motors. In this study, the additional {{degrees of freedom}} available in five-phase permanent magnet motors {{have been used for}} three purposes: 1) enhancing the torque producing capability of the motor, 2) improving the reliability of the system, and 3) better adjusting of the torque and flux linkages of the five-phase direct torque controlled system. 1) Due to the fact that space and time harmonics of the same orders will contribute positively to output torque, a five-phase permanent magnet motor with quasi-rectangular back-EMF waveform is supplied with combined fundamental and third harmonic of currents. For modeling and analysis of the motor a 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference is defined where 1 1 q d rotates at the synchronous speed and 3 3 q d rotates at the three times synchronous speed. Based on the mathematical model in the 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference, it is shown that this system while having a higher torque density with respect to a conventional permanent magnet synchronous machine, is also compatible with vector control algorithm. 2) A resilient current control of the five-phase permanent motor with both sinusoidal and trapezoidal back-EMF waveforms under asymmetrical fault condition is proposed. In this scheme, the stator MMF is kept unchanged during healthy and faulty condition. Therefore, the five-phase permanent magnet motor operates continuously and steadily without additional hardware and just by modifying the control algorithm in case of loss of up to two phases. The feature is of major importance in some specific applications where high reliability is required. 3) High torque and flux ripple are the major drawbacks of a three-phase direct torque controlled system. The number of space voltage vectors directly influences the performance of DTC system. A five-phase drive, while benefiting from other advantages of high order phase drives, has inherently 32 space voltage vectors which permits better flexibility in selecting the switching states and finer adjustment of flux and torque. A sensorless direct torque control of five-phase permanent magnet motor is implemented. Speed information is obtained based on the position of stator flux <b>linkages</b> and <b>load</b> angle. Experiments have been conducted on a 5 kW five-phase surface mount permanent magnet motor and a 3 kW five-phase interior permanent magnet motor by using TMS 320 C 32 DSP. The results obtained are consistent with theoretical studies and simulation analysis, which further demonstrate the feasibility and practical significance of the five-phase permanent magnet motor drives...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of soil {{acidification}} on tree growth requires understanding the nutrient relations of trees and stands, notably the uptake of nutrients by the roots in relation to soil conditions. Although {{a substantial amount of}} research has been carried out on nutrient relationships, both on plant and stand scale, changes in nutrient uptake as a result of soil acidification are hard to predict. This poses serious problems for attempts to model nutrient uptake by roots in relation to changes in soil chemistry induced by acidification and nitrogen enrichment. Very detailed mechanistic models of root uptake have been developed, but the extrapolation of rhizosphere models developed under controlled, laboratory conditions to field situations is cumbersome. On the other hand, general models of nutrient dynamics very often lack the sensitivity that is required to describe the reaction to gradually changing site conditions. This renders difficult the <b>linkage</b> between critical <b>loads</b> derived from soil criteria, and tree and stand reactions such as allocation and growth. In the models applied to Solling, most emphasis is on soil chemistry, with only few models accounting for feedback mechanisms between soil conditions and tree growth. From the model results presented during the workshop, it would appear that nitrogen and magnesium are the key elements in Solling, but such conclusion is biased as much the same assumption also underlies the guiding concepts on which the models are based. From the models presented at the workshop, no clear consensus emerged on the predictions of the consequences of changes in soil chemistry. At this stage, {{there seems to be a}} clear need for additional experimental results on nutrient transport in soil, on decomposition under changed soil conditions, and on nutrient uptake in the case of competition between different ions. In addition, more detailed information on the response of uptake kinetics and biomass allocation in case of reduced nutrient supply, would improve deterministic models of nutrient relations of trees. From such experimental information, theoretical understanding can be derived, and perspectives for generalization and modelling can be drawn...|$|R

As a prelude to understanding the feasibility of alternative interventions in different industrial sectors, we present case studies from 10 different industrial units in Tamil Nadu, Chennai, which describe perceptions of occupational heat stress among the workers and supervisors/management. Units were selected from among those who had previously requested an assessment of workplace heat stress exposure at select locations as part of routine industrial hygiene services provided by the investigators. Since the earlier measurements were performed in response to a management request, all units were revisited to generate a simple job and process profile using checklists in order to understand the overall heat exposure situation in the concerned unit. This was followed by a simple questionnaire administration to a small subsample of employees to evaluate the perceptions of workers and supervisors/management. Finally, we retrieved available quantitative data from previous measurements of heat stress at these units to correlate prevalence of exposures with respective perceptions. Results indicate that the existing level of controls may not be sufficient for managing work-related heat stress in any of the sectors studied, with wide variations in perceived risks. There was a noticeable disconnect between worker&#x 0027;s perceptions and their ability to secure workplace improvements related to heat stress from the management. Wider availability of engineering and administrative controls in the industries may be facilitated by monitoring worker discomfort, disability, and performance in more intensive ways so that the top management is able to justify the associated cost benefits. Given the potential implications of future climate change related increases in ambient heat stress that are likely to translate into workplace exposures in developing country settings, concerted efforts are needed to integrate exposure assessments with assessments of productivity as well as health impacts. This will likely build the momentum for much needed interventions for large worker populations in the developing world...|$|R
