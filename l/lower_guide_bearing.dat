40|$|Many {{cases of}} high {{vibration}} and changing vibration in reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) {{can be traced}} to one of several types of degradation in the lower motor guide bearing. This paper presents a comparison of the vibrational characteristics for several failure modes. Included in this list are loss of lubricant, bearing overloading, and time-varying shoe clearance. Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components. This paper provides a simple assessment {{of the extent to which}} fatigue life is impacted. I. Background I. 1 Design Considerations Experience has shown that one of the most common failures in nuclear main coolant pumps involves the lower motor bearing. Typically, the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> is an oil-immersed, segmented shoe bearing. Figure 1 shows the arrangement for a typical Westinghouse, or similarly designed, reactor coolant pump. There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main coolant pumps are three-bearing machines, wherein the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the lower motor bearing that is most likely to fail...|$|E

40|$|Cavitation {{erosion of}} Francis {{turbines}} continues to impose costly repairs {{and loss of}} revenues. This erosion is primarily caused by leading edge cavitation. A revue of the literature reveals the non-existence of an absolutely validated detection technique of this cavitation in operating Francis turbines. Considering the impulsive character of the implosion of a cavitation structure, the assimilation of cavitation erosion to a process of mechanical fatigue of materials and the vibratory response at high frequencies of a linear structure to multiple random excitations whose responses add on a power basis, we have proposed that the vibratory response of a Francis turbine at high frequencies is tightly related to its cavitation erosion rate. The absolute measurement of cavitation aggressiveness on the blades {{can be made by}} the normalization of <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration measurements by an average Transmissibility function measured by reciprocity with the runner underwater. The proposed method has been validated and it is now possible to state that the MSV of inferred forces at the cavitation impact rate of hydrodynamic origin is proportional to the erosion rate. The approach has been validated in excellent manner in laboratory set-ups with little or no flows by comparison to absolute cavitation aggressiveness assessment methods such as the DECER electrochemical technique and the pit counting technique on polished material samples. The validation was then pursued with laboratory homologous flows on a NACA 009 profile in the LMH high-speed cavitation tunnel with blade mounted DECER sensors as reference. Once again, impact frequencies of hydrodynamic origin, following here a Strouhal law, were observed and the MSV of the profile acceleration at high frequencies was proportional to the average erosion rate on the profile. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the measurements, the results were excellent and fared well with the erosive power of the flow in V 3 L 2 (V= flow velocity, L= length of the attached vapour cavity). Preliminary measurements on a Francis model with blade mounted DECER sensors agreed well with the MSV of <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> acceleration at high frequencies. Later measurements on the Rapide Blanc model confirmed the damage model observed on the NACA profile. Hydrodynamic impact frequencies were however not governed by the tunnel Strouhal law but were found to be determined by the blade passage frequency. Stationary measurements at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> were equivalent to runner on board measurements. Reciprocity, typical to linear structures, was verfied. As on the profile, maximum aggressiveness on the runner blade occurs in the leading edge cavity closure area. This was confirmed by the application of "Prescale" pressure sensitive film on the blades for operating conditions generating maximum vibratory response at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies. High-speed video recordings shot at 2000 frames/s allowed detailed observation of the dynamics of the cavitation structures at the blade passage frequency. Visual observations of cavitation developments along with implosion frequencies allowed observing that the MSV of vibratory response at high frequencies at the cavitation impact occurrence rate was coherent with the calculated value of the flow erosive power inasmuch as the implosions occurred on the blades and not beyond the blade trailing edges. These results on the Francis model therefore supported the proposed vibratory detection approach. The application of the developed techniques, including the measurements of Transmissibility with the runners underwater, allowed assessing the difference in absolute cavitation aggressiveness on an existing and proposed replacement model runner for the Beauharnois power plant. The applicability of the proposed measurement and calibration methods was confirmed on prototype N° 6 of the Rapide Blanc power plant. Measurements on fixed and rotating elements of the machine are equivalent and reciprocity also applies. The recurrence frequency of the cavitation impacts was however {{different from that of the}} model. The difference appears to be due to the semi-spiral case utilized on the model. It was not fully homologous to the full spiral case of the prototype. It would thus appear that on the model, the wake of the semi-spiral case tongue plays a determinant role in the generation and implosion process of cavitating structures while on the prototype the wakes of the wicket gates fill that function. The ultimate validation of the vibratory approach to the detection of erosive cavitation on Francis prototypes occurred in 1995 on unit 44 of the Manic 5 PA power plant. This was done using on board sensors (pressure, DECER and accelerometer) on severely eroded blade 4 and polished 316 L stainless steel disks mounted in this same blade after removal of the pressure sensor housings. Paint removal and pit counting tests had previously correlated well in 1993 with the MSV of global modulation of high frequency acceleration at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> at the cavitation hydrodynamic impact occurrence rate which was for this prototype the wicket gate passing frequency for a rotating observer. The 1995 correlation of the MSV of the blade 4 high frequency acceleration modulation at the wicket gate passage hydrodynamic frequency with the volume pitting rate of the 316 L stainless steel disks and the DECER erosion current was excellent. The existence in the flow of the 60 Hz (rotation speed, 180 r. p. m., 20 wicket gates) hydrodynamic frequency was confirmed by dynamic pressure measurements on blade 4 and in the draft tube just below the runner. The per blade inferred forces were calculated for each set of test conditions with the average Transmissibility measured by reciprocity on five blades with the runner underwater. The MSV of high frequency inferred forces agrees better with the real aggressiveness than does the wideband acceleration but not as well as the MSV of the acceleration modulation at the hydrodynamic frequencies of the cavitation impacts. Improvements on this subject have been incorporated in the cavitation erosion monitoring system now in operation at Hydro-Québec. Tu summarize, the MSV of the vibratory response at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> modulated at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies describes well its relative aggressiveness with varying operating conditions and the use of an averaged Transmissibility measured with the runner underwater allows to estimate it on an absolute basis...|$|E

40|$|In 2005 a {{vertical}} 42 MW hydropower unit was upgraded in Sweden. The upgrade included the fitting {{of a new}} turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> a modified runner, a modified turbine regulator and a new brushless exciter. One of the requirements was that the dynamic behaviour of the machine should not be affected. In spite of the requirements, resonance problems became apparent after the hydropower unit was re-commissioned. Measurements from the re-ommissioning showed poor alignment of the shaft system and shape deviations in the generator. The exchange of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> from a sleeve bearing to a block bearing also caused changes in the machines dynamic behaviour. Measurements on the unit were conducted at normal operation and resonance. These show that at normal operation, the machine has dominant frequencies at the nominal speed and at twice the nominal speed. When the machine goes into resonance, the dominant frequencies increase to approx. 2. 4 times the nominal speed. The machine will undergo a major overhaul in ten years. The objective {{is to find a}} solution of the resonance problem that is both inexpensive and possible to implement. The conclusion was drawn that the low damped eigenmode at 2. 4 times the nominal speed had been excited and caused the machine to go into resonance. The unit's dynamic sensitivity to different bearing settings was investigated numerically and with tests on site, i. e. bearing clearances were varied. The calculated result was verified against measured resonance frequencies. Agreement between the estimated and measured result was good. Other possible measures to rectify the resonance problems were also analyzed numerically. The effect of making the surrounding structures more rigid, the installation of additional <b>guide</b> <b>bearings,</b> making the shaft system more rigid, etc. were examined. A temporary solution, used for the last six months, is to operate the machine with larger bearing clearances on all bearings. Increased bearing clearance of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> cause increased damping of the natural frequency at 2. 4 times the nominal speed. No problems related to resonance have occurred at the hydropower unit during the last six months. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20081111 (ysko) </p...|$|R

Besides, an acoustic emission sensor has been located next to the fixed accelerometer in the bearing pedestal.

This permits to investigate the erosion process from a location which is directly connected to the blades. The advantage of such a situation is that the influence of the fluid film bearing and of the rotating frame of reference are avoided compared with measurements from a fixed position.

Unfortunately most installed pump-turbines are not manufactured with in-built pressure sensors in appropriate positions to monitor RSI. For this reason, vibration measurements are the preferred method to monitor RSI in industry. Usually vibrations are measured in two perpendicular radial directions in bearings where valuable information could be lost due to bearing response. In this work, in order to avoid the effect of bearing response on measurement, two vibration sensors are installed rotating with the shaft.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the machine lay-out of a scale based stand-alone design, presently under construction, aimed at an accuracy of 25 nm in a 50 × 50 × 4 mm 3 volume. The scales have 1 nm resolution and are direct driven by single phase, linear DC motors. In the horizontal plane an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> system is used with separate stress frames for bearing pre-load forces. The elastically guided vertical z-axis has 4 mm stroke and is measuring in Abbe. It is thermally-, weight- and stiffness compensated and mounted statically determined on the x, y scale carrying beams. Compared to CMMs with a vertical air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> system, {{the mass of}} the guides and their vertical drive offset was reduced significantly. A large improvement in system dynamics features a lowest eigenfrequency (rotation mode around the z-axis) of about 60 Hz. The uncertainty of a volumetric length measurement, due to residual geometric errors, will be about ± 20 nm...|$|R
