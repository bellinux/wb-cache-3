40|$|We {{examine the}} ethical {{principles}} underpinning advance directives (ADs) {{and the legal}} duties of doctors in determining their validity. A physician attending an incompetent patient with an acute life-threatening illness, and an AD refusing treatment, should ensure that the AD is <b>legally</b> <b>valid</b> before making the treatment decision. Treatment against a patient's wishes, as expressed in a valid AD, compromises patient autonomy and may constitute battery. Conversely, withholding treatment in accordance with an AD that is not <b>legally</b> <b>valid</b> risks substantial harm to the patient and may constitute breach of the duty of care and negligence. <b>Legally</b> <b>valid</b> directives should be respected. If an AD is not <b>legally</b> <b>valid,</b> the patient should be treated {{in his or her}} best interests. If uncertain, the physician should treat according to the patient's best interests while seeking legal advice...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the historiography, the law, {{and the practice of}} irregular marriage in Britain. It argues {{that there has been a}} confusion of terms in the historiography of irregular marriage that has served to obscure its meaning, pattern, and incidence. Using evidence from Scotland where irregular marriage continued to be <b>legally</b> <b>valid</b> until 1939 (with one form remaining <b>legally</b> <b>valid</b> until 2006), the article argues that despite its <b>legally</b> <b>valid</b> status, the interpretation of what constituted irregular marriage was extremely limited and that it served as a de facto or functional equivalent to civil marriage. In the formal legal sense Scotland had stood virtually alone amongst Western European countries in enshrining simple exchange of consent as sufficient basis for marriage. However, in practice Scotland was very similar to other countries in what was regarded as acceptable forms of contracting marriage and the same stigma was attached to informal or irregular unions that we see elsewhere. However, as elsewhere, the majority of people conformed to the legal rules and the legal paradigms of marriage, but equally there was no neat correspondence between legal codes and social practice with ordinary people adopting a more flexible definition of marriage than the official one...|$|R
