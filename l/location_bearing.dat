50|$|The {{population}} {{of many of}} the unincorporated entities has historically been transitory, and some have rarely if ever reported any population at all. The only ones that have reported population in each census since 1900 are Dixville Township, Millsfield Township and Wentworth’s <b>Location</b> (<b>bearing</b> in mind that Wentworth’s Location was an incorporated town for many years prior to the 1960s). All three appear to have small but well-established population bases. Wentworth’s Location has reported a {{population of}} at least 37 in every post-1900 census. Dixville and Millsfield have consistently been in double figures throughout the same period (the only exceptions being Millsfield in 1960 and 1980); in both communities, a town clerk's office exist for the purpose of conducting elections for state and federal officials. In addition to those noted above, Pinkham’s Grant reported population in every census from 1930 to 1990, although its population exceeded 17 in only one census, and it reported no population in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Klein Heidelberg was the code-name give to {{a passive}} radar system devised in 1941. The system was a bi-static radar system. What was unusual {{was that the}} {{transmitters}} were British rather than German! The system worked by using the reflections from the Chain Home (British coastal radar system) rather than transmitters associated with the receivers. Klein Heidelberg worked by sensing Chain Home (CH) transmission pulses directly with a small auxiliary antenna, close to the main antenna, whose receiver was tuned to a particular CH station whose exact <b>location,</b> <b>bearing</b> and range was known. The CH signal was then used to synchronise the KH with the CH transmission pulses. The CH pulse started a circular trace on a cathode ray tube (CRT) divided into forty sections. The main antenna received the reflection of these pulses from the target and displayed them on the CRT. Range was between 300-600 km. The display was 2D. Resolution was not very good but it allowed the Germans to see bomber formations forming up over England and the general path of the bomber streams. Its big advantage was {{it was not possible}} for the British to jam without jamming their own radars. The system entered service in late 1943 and by late 1944 six system were commissioned on the Dutch coast.|$|E

40|$|Rotor-bearing system characteristics, such {{as natural}} frequencies, mode shapes, {{stiffness}} and damping coefficients, {{are essential to}} diagnose and correct vibration problems during system operation. Of the above characteristics, accurate identification of bearing force parameters, i. e. stiffness and damping coefficients, {{is one of the}} most difficult to achieve. Field identification by imbalance response measurements is a simple and often reliable way to determine synchronous speed force coefficients. An enhanced method to estimate bearing support force coefficients in flexible rotor-bearing systems is detailed. The estimation is carried out from measurements obtained near <b>bearing</b> <b>locations</b> from two linearly independent imbalance tests. An earlier approach assumed rotordynamic measurements at the <b>bearing</b> <b>locations,</b> which is very difficult to realize in practice. The enhanced method relaxes this constraint and develops the procedure to estimate bearing coefficients from measurements near the <b>bearing</b> <b>locations.</b> An application of the method is presented for a test rotor mounted on two-lobe hydrodynamic bearings. Imbalance response measurements for various imbalance magnitudes are obtained near <b>bearing</b> <b>locations</b> and also at rotor mid-span. At shaft speeds around the bending critical speed, the displacements at the rotor mid-span are an order of magnitude larger than the shaft displacements at the <b>bearing</b> <b>locations.</b> The enhanced identification procedure renders satisfactory force coefficients in the rotational speed range between 1, 000 rpm and 4, 000 rpm. The amount of imbalance mass needed to conduct the tests and to obtain reliable shaft displacement measurements influences slightly the magnitude of the identified force coefficients. The effect of increasing the number of rotor sub-elements in the finite-element modeling of the shaft is noted. Sensitivity of the method and derived parameters to noise in the measurements is also quantified...|$|R

30|$|The {{received}} {{signal strength}} (RSS) {{is used to}} localize nodes and hence is used to detect identity attacks since these schemes assume that each location must be bound by a unique and distinct identity. Messages emanating from the same <b>location</b> <b>bearing</b> two or more than two identities will be detected as Sybil attacks. Similarly, messages received from different locations with the same identities will be classed as replication attacks. The RSS is also hard to be forged. Existing RSS-based countermeasures use diverse antennas and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Some authors [31, 32] use air monitors (AM) as an additional hardware device that sniffs the traffic passively to detect spoofing attacks on the MAC layer. However, this approach creates additional hardware overhead for the infrastructure-less 802.11 [27]-based ad hoc networks [31 – 33].|$|E

40|$|Glasgow {{seems to}} be arguing more than this; that some {{representation}} languages are inherently `depictive' where as others are not. But `depictiveness' is conditional on the axioms/relations which the user chooses to define when using a language, be it propositional, array or whatever. I emphasise this, as it is seductive to draw an array and decide it intuitively `looks' more like a spatial analog than a set of propositions. But this is a deception, created by the miriad of spatial relationships which the human mind overlays on the (much more impoverished) set of relations which a machine can compute, but which are subconsciously attributed to the machine nonetheless. In fact, all the machine `knows' are bytes (in physical <b>locations</b> <b>bearing</b> no correspondence to {{the locations of the}} objects they represent), and a small set of computations on these.

40|$|In the oceanic context, {{the aim of}} Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is to {{estimate}} the state, i. e. <b>location,</b> <b>bearing</b> and velocity, of a sound-emitting object.

This paper integrates VMS data and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) observer data from the United States Eastern Bering Sea pollock fishery to predict whether or not fishing is occurring for unobserved fishing trips. While there is 100 percent observer coverage for all catcher-processors and motherships in the fishery and some of the vessels that deliver to shoreside processors, approximately 2 / 3 s of catcher vessels that deliver to shoreside processors have coverage for only 30 percent of their fishing days.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper presented here {{is to determine the}} relationships for describing the bending and torsional vibrations of long cardan drivelines and to compare the calculated results to the experimental results. The problem of the resonance of cardan shaft drivelines means a considerable difficulty in the field of designing. Dynamic modelling could solve the problem by determining the natural frequency of the system. The load is dependent on the ratio of the natural frequency to the excitation frequency. Furthermore, the dynamic model is suitable for tuning/detuning the natural frequency. The parameters of the driveline (moment of inertia, bearing stiffness, shaft length, etc.) are the input data of the simulation model developed and the effects of changes can be determined. The driveline can be designed according to the results of the simulation of a flywheel <b>location,</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness and cardan shaft length.

40|$|This {{project has}} {{estimated}} coal strength in selected {{parts of the}} Greymouth and Reefton Coalfields {{in order to better}} estimate the size of pillars needed to maintain stability of the underground workings. Coal strength in known to decrease with increasing rank, and the Greymouth Coalfield displays to a very high rank gradient increasing from west to east. The mines assessed by this study were the Bishop Block, Strongman No. 2, Spring Creek, Roa and Terrace (Reefton Coalfield) Mines. Core samples could not be obtained from all locations so 63. 5 mm cubes and point load tests were used, and compared to a control group of with a known UCS/cube relationship, in order to develop an equation from which a UCS equivalent value could be determined. Coal strength drops from 24 MPa in the west (Strongman No. 2 E seam) to 1. 3 MPa in the east of the coalfield (Roa mine Kimbell seam). Other coal properties also shows changes corresponding to changes in coal strength including carbon, volatile matter, ash, and the degree of cleating. Ash {{is the only one of}} these which is not related to increasing rank. Cleat frequency, which increases with coal rank has the most significant effect on coal strength. The equations of Bieniawski and Salamon-Munro have been used for pillar strength calculations with panel pillars designed to a factor of safety of 1. 6. Optimum pillar sizes for each of the locations in this study have been calculated, but small changes to these sizes may be necessary depending on local conditions such as faults and sheared zones. Pillar design must take into account the chance of pillar shearing once seam dip increases above 20 ° as the shear strength becomes greatly reduced with increasing seam dip. Coal from the Spring Creek Mine shows a high degree of anisotropy and so pillars have been designed for specific seam dips at this <b>location.</b> <b>Bearing</b> capacity of the fireclay in the Terrace Mine is greatly reduced with increasing seam dip and overburden thickness, thus increasing the chances of floor heave.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in successful upper limb prostheses is the socket design. Sockets must be individually fabricated to arrive at a geometry that suits the user's morphology and appropriately distributes the pressures associated with prosthetic use across the residual limb. In higher levels of amputation, such as transhumeral, this challenge is amplified as prosthetic weight and the physical demands placed on the residual limb are heightened. Yet, in the upper limb, socket fabrication is largely driven by heuristic practices. An analytical understanding of the interactions between the socket and residual limb is absent in literature. This work describes techniques, adapted from lower limb prosthetic research, to empirically characterize the pressure distribution occurring between the residual limb and well-fit transhumeral prosthetic sockets. A case series analyzing the result of four participants with transhumeral amputation is presented. A Tekscan VersaTek pressure measurement system and FaroArm Edge coordinate measurement machine were employed to capture socket-residual limb interface pressures and geometrically register these values to the anatomy of participants. Participants performed two static poses with their prosthesis under two separate loading conditions. Surface pressure maps were constructed from the data, highlighting pressure distribution patterns, anatomical <b>locations</b> <b>bearing</b> maximum pressure, and the relative pressure magnitudes. Pressure distribution patterns demonstrated unique characteristics across the four participants that could be traced to individual socket design considerations.
