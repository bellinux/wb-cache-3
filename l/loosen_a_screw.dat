There are some factors that can affect initial torque loss, including tightening torque value, implant system, abutment screw material, errors in casting of metallic alloys, repeated tightening/loosening cycles of the screw, and improper insertion torque. These factors can reduce the frictional fit between the screws and internal threads of the implant, which may lead to screw loosening [9, 10].|$|R

30|$|Supracondylar nailing was {{performed}} in 10 patients who sustained periprosthetic fractures above total knee arthroplasties. The fractures occurred in women {{with an average age}} of 67.4 years (range, 42 – 92 years). All fractures healed in a satisfactory alignment in an average duration of 13.2 weeks (range, 12 – 18 weeks). None of the fractures needed bone grafting. There were no cases of wound infections, nonunion or delayed union. All patients achieved satisfactory range of movement of the knee joint and preoperative functional status. Main complications included <b>loosening</b> of <b>a</b> distal <b>screw</b> in one patient and fracture above the short nail following a second injury in another patient. Use of a longer nail where possible and a condylar bolt for distal locking can easily avoid these complications. We conclude that supracondylar nailing, despite some limitations, is a satisfactory method of treatment for a majority of displaced periprosthetic fractures above well-fixed total knee arthroplasties.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies that}} {{evaluated}} the torque needed for removing dental implant screws have not considered {{the manner of}} transfer of the occlusal loads in clinical settings. Instead, the torque used for removal was applied directly to the screw, {{and most of them}} omitted the possibility that the hexagon could limit the action of the occlusal load in the loosening of the screws. The present study proposes a method for evaluating the screw removal torque in an anti-rotational device independent way, creating an unscrewing load transfer to the entire assembly, not only to the screw. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty hexagonal abutments without the hexagon in their bases were fixed with <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> to 20 dental implants. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 used titanium screws and Group 2 used titanium <b>screws</b> covered with <b>a</b> solid lubricant. A torque of 32 Ncm was applied to the <b>screw</b> and then <b>a</b> custom-made wrench was used for rotating the abutment counterclockwise, to <b>loosen</b> the <b>screw.</b> <b>A</b> digital torque meter recorded the torque required to loosen the abutment. RESULTS: There was {{a significant difference between the}} means of Group 1 (38. 62 ± 6. 43 Ncm) and Group 2 (48. 47 ± 5. 04 Ncm), with p= 0. 001. CONCLUSION: This methodology was effective in comparing unscrewing torque values of the implant-abutment junction even with a limited sample size. It confirmed a previously shown significant difference between two types of screws...|$|R

50|$|In {{critical}} fastener joints, embedment {{can mean}} loss of preload. Flattening of a surface allows {{the strain of}} <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload. In bolted joints with particularly short grip lengths, the loss of preload due to embedment can be especially significant, causing complete loss of preload. Therefore, embedment can lead directly to <b>loosening</b> of <b>a</b> fastener joint and subsequent fatigue failure.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of a structure are {{a function of}} its physical properties, {{and changes in the}} physical properties of the structure, including the introduction of structural damage, can cause changes in its dynamic behavior. Structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection methods provide a means to assess the structural integrity and safety of a civil structure using measurements of its {{dynamic properties}}. In particular, these techniques enable a quick damage assessment following a seismic event. In this thesis, the application of high-frequency seismograms to damage detection in civil structures is investigated. Two novel methods for SHM are developed and validated using small-scale experimental testing, existing structures in situ, and numerical testing. The first method is developed for pre-Northridge steel-moment-resisting frame buildings that are susceptible to weld fracture at beam-column connections. The method is based on using the response of a structure to a nondestructive force (i. e., a hammer blow) to approximate the response of the structure to a damage event (i. e., weld fracture). The method is applied to a small-scale experimental frame, where the impulse response functions of the frame are generated during an impact hammer test. The method is also applied to a numerical model of a steel frame, in which weld fracture is modeled as the tensile opening of a Mode I crack. Impulse response functions are experimentally obtained for a steel moment-resisting frame building in situ. Results indicate that while acceleration and velocity records generated by a damage event are best approximated by the acceleration and velocity records generated by a colocated hammer blow, the method may not be robust to noise. The method seems to be better suited for damage localization, where information such as arrival times and peak accelerations can also provide indication of the damage location. This is of significance for sparsely-instrumented civil structures. The second SHM method is designed to extract features from high-frequency acceleration records that may indicate the presence of damage. As short-duration high-frequency signals (i. e., pulses) can be indicative of damage, this method relies on the identification and classification of pulses in the acceleration records. It is recommended that, in practice, the method be combined with a vibration-based method {{that can be used to}} estimate the loss of stiffness. Briefly, pulses observed in the acceleration time series when the structure is known to be in an undamaged state are compared with pulses observed when the structure is in a potentially damaged state. By comparing the pulse signatures from these two situations, changes in the high-frequency dynamic behavior of the structure can be identified, and damage signals can be extracted and subjected to further analysis. The method is successfully applied to a small-scale experimental shear beam that is dynamically excited at its base using a shake table and damaged by <b>loosening</b> <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> to create <b>a</b> moving part. Although the damage is aperiodic and nonlinear in nature, the damage signals are accurately identified, and the location of damage is determined using the amplitudes and arrival times of the damage signal. The method is also successfully applied to detect the occurrence of damage in a test bed data set provided by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in which nonlinear damage is introduced into a small-scale steel frame by installing a bumper mechanism that inhibits the amount of motion between two floors. The method is successfully applied and is robust despite a low sampling rate, though false negatives (undetected damage signals) begin to occur at high levels of damage when the frequency of damage events increases. The method is also applied to acceleration data recorded on a damaged cable-stayed bridge in China, provided by the Center of Structural Monitoring and Control at the Harbin Institute of Technology. Acceleration records recorded after the date of damage show a clear increase in high-frequency short-duration pulses compared to those previously recorded. One undamage pulse and two damage pulses are identified from the data. The occurrence of the detected damage pulses is consistent with a progression of damage and matches the known chronology of damage. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of active piezoceramic sensors and actuators into passive sheet metal assemblies produces smart structures. Smart structures {{are capable of}} sensing the condition of parts and systems as well as interacting with the environment. Today, smart sheet metal parts are manufactured by surface bonding of sensors and actuators on shaped structural parts. This paper presents a technology for the direct structural {{integration of}} lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) fibers. The fibers are integrated in flat sheet metal, which is subsequently shaped by forming. Microcavities are formed into {{the surface of the}} flat metal sheet in which the piezoceramic fibers are inserted and joined. After that, the composite is shaped into a complex 3 D surface by deep drawing. The production technology is discussed in detail with regard to the limits of each process step. Functional prototypes with ten interconnected parallel piezoceramic fibers were fabricated. The function as actuator and sensor for ultrasonic elastic waves is demonstrated and the degradation due to the shaping is compared for different parameters of the deep drawing process. The composite shapes are cups with a double curvature radius of 100 mm and 250 mm respectively. As a result, degradation of the piezoelectric function varies with the process parameters. In the case of a double curvature of 250 mm, a degradation of the transducer function of 20 % was shown in the experiments. The cause of the decreased performance after shaping is discussed and explained by debonding mechanisms. Results of numerical simulations show a good agreement with the experimental findings of the optimum process parameters. Furthermore, a setup of a wing assembly segment is used to demonstrate the potential of integrated PZT fibers in shaped metal structures. The integrated fibers are used for health monitoring of a multiple bolted joint. It is shown that <b>loosening</b> of <b>a</b> single <b>screw</b> can accurately be detected by the directly integrated PZT fibers...|$|R
