40|$|Background: <b>Landiolol</b> {{effectively}} controls rapid {{heart rate}} in atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, predicting <b>landiolol</b> Responders and Non-Responders and patients who will experience adverse effects remains a challenge. The {{aim of this}} study was to clarify the potential applicability of <b>landiolol</b> for rapid AF/AFL and refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in patients with heart failure. Methods: A total of 39 patients with AF/AFL with ventricular response ≥ 120  bpm and 12 VTs were retrospectively enrolled. <b>Landiolol</b> Responders for rapid AF/AFL were defined as patients whose ventricular response was suppressed to less than 110  bpm or decreased by ≥ 20 % from the initial heart rate after administration of <b>landiolol.</b> Responders for VTs were defined as patients with no recurrent VTs during the 24  h after the initiation of <b>landiolol.</b> Results: For AF/AFL, 29 patients (74 %) were Responders. In nine patients (31 %), AF was spontaneously terminated after starting <b>landiolol.</b> Eight Non-Responders (80 %) needed to have AF terminated by cardioversion. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline was significantly associated with <b>landiolol</b> efficacy. For VTs, seven patients (58 %) were Responders, and smaller LV diastolic and systolic diameters were associated with <b>landiolol</b> efficacy. Hypotension after <b>landiolol</b> treatment occurred in 5 of 51 patients, and lower LV systolic function was associated with the development of adverse events. Conclusions: <b>Landiolol</b> is effective in patients with heart failure not only due to rapid AF/AFL but also due to VTs.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Landiolol</b> {{hydrochloride}} is an ultra-short-acting β-blocker that {{is administered}} intravenously and has many advantages in cardiac surgery. This study {{was performed to}} examine the safety and efficacy of low-dose <b>landiolol</b> continuous infusion in cardiac surgery. Methods and Results: Nineteen patients who underwent either aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery received low-dose continuous infusion of <b>landiolol</b> (2. 8 ± 0. 75 μg/kg/min. {{from the time of}} skin incision until the second postoperative day. Nineteen patients who did not receive <b>landiolol</b> served as controls. Heart rate, arterial pressure, cardiac index, and stroke volume were measured and the occurrence of supraventricular tachyarrythmia was monitored for one week after surgery. <b>Landiolol</b> decreased the heart rate without causing hemodynamic deterioration. The incidence of supraventricular tachyarrythmia was 32 % and 47 % in the <b>landiolol</b> and control groups, respectively (P = 0. 50). Conclusions: <b>Landiolol</b> is effective for decreasing heart rate while maintaining other hemodynamic parameters. Our data did not show a clear prophylactic effect of <b>landiolol</b> on postoperative supraventricular tachyarrythmia...|$|E
40|$|Supplemental <b>landiolol</b> {{administration}} (20 or 40 μg kg− 1 min− 1) effectively diminished harmful hemodynamic {{changes during}} bronchoscopic endotracheal suctioning compared to normal saline. However, inappropriate use of <b>landiolol</b> (i. e., failure of evaluating {{factors that influence}} hemodynamic changes) may iatrogenically further complicate pathophysiology, and relatively higher doses of <b>landiolol</b> may be dangerous. We recommend that <b>landiolol</b> should not be routinely used to control cardiovascular responses during bronchoscopic endotracheal suctioning {{in the intensive care}} unit. Careful evaluation of factors influencing hemodynamic changes and close monitoring of the patient are mandatory following <b>landiolol</b> administration.

40|$|Perioperative {{beta-blocker}} {{administration has}} recently been recommended for patients undergoing cardiac or other surgery due to the beneficial cardiovascular effects of these agents. In addition, some studies have reported that perioperatively administered beta-blockers also have analgesic effects. In this study, to investigate the antinociceptive effects and the analgesic profile of <b>landiolol,</b> we {{examined the effects of}} intrathecal <b>landiolol</b> administration on nociceptive pain behavior and c-fos mRNA expression (a neural marker of pain) in the spinal cord using a rat formalin model. We found that pain-related behavior was inhibited by intrathecal <b>landiolol</b> administration. Moreover, the increase in c-fos mRNA expression on the formalin-injected side was less pronounced in rats administered <b>landiolol</b> than in saline administered controls.

40|$|Background: Immediate {{recurrence}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) after radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is commonly observed within 3  d after the procedure. The mechanism and pharmacological management of immediate AF recurrence remain unclear. Methods: A total of 50 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF were randomized to receive either low-dose <b>landiolol</b> (<b>landiolol</b> group) or a placebo (placebo group). In the <b>landiolol</b> group, intravenous <b>landiolol</b> (0. 5  μg kg− 1  min− 1) was administered for 3  d after AF ablation. Results: No {{serious adverse event}} associated with RF catheter ablation or <b>landiolol</b> administration was observed. The prevalence of immediate AF recurrence (≤ 3  d after RF catheter ablation) was significantly lower in the <b>landiolol</b> group than {{in the placebo group}} (16 % vs. 48 %, p= 0. 015). Although the postprocedural change in heart rate was significantly lower in the <b>landiolol</b> group compared to that in the placebo group, the changes in blood pressure and body temperature were not different between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that <b>landiolol</b> treatment was the only independent predictor of immediate AF recurrence after ablation (odds ratio: 0. 180; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 044 – 0. 729; p= 0. 016). Conclusions: Prophylactic administration of low-dose <b>landiolol</b> after AF ablation may be effective and safe for preventing immediate AF recurrence within 3  d after AF ablation...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveAtrial {{fibrillation}} occurs frequently after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and not only}} prolongs hospitalization but also influences the prognosis. We investigated whether <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride, an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker, could reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation in a randomized controlled trial. MethodsThe subjects were 140 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting at the Nihon University School of Medicine. The primary end point was occurrence/non-occurrence of atrial fibrillation up to 1 week postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for atrial fibrillation among preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative variables. ResultsAtrial fibrillation occurred in 7 patients (10 %) in the <b>landiolol</b> group versus 24 patients (34. 3 %) in the placebo group; the <b>landiolol</b> group had a significantly lower incidence (P = . 0006). Postoperative heart rate was significantly lower in the <b>landiolol</b> group than in the placebo group. On returning to the intensive care unit, the <b>landiolol</b> group had significantly lower inflammatory and ischemic parameters. Medical costs were also significantly lower in the <b>landiolol</b> group. Multivariate analysis revealed that significant risk factors for atrial fibrillation were a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of 10 or more, preoperative non-use of angiotensin receptor blockers, and non-use of <b>landiolol.</b> ConclusionsPostoperative atrial fibrillation was reduced by treatment with <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride. Amelioration of ischemia, an anti-inflammatory effect, and inhibition of sympathetic hypertonia by <b>landiolol</b> presumably reduced the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Hypotension or bradycardia did not develop {{in any of the}} patients, indicating the safety of this beta-blocker.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} acute hemodynamic effects {{and safety of}} <b>landiolol</b> in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundBeta-blockers have been proven to be effective {{for the treatment of}} ischemic heart disease in both the acute and chronic phases. <b>Landiolol,</b> an ultra-short-acting and highly cardioselective beta- 1 blocker, has become available in Japan. In the clinical setting, the hemodynamic response to <b>landiolol</b> administration remains unclear in patients presenting with ACS. MethodsFrom August 2007 to April 2008, <b>landiolol</b> was administered intravenously immediately before reperfusion procedure in 22 consecutive ACS patients (mean age, 63 ± 9 years; 15 men) with a heart rate (HR) of ≥ 70 beats/min. The initial intravenous administration dose of <b>landiolol</b> was 20 μg/kg/min in all patients. The maintenance dose was titrated with the aim of reducing HR by 15 %. Acute hemodynamic data including HR and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were serially evaluated. ResultsHR dropped significantly (from 87 ± 11 to 72 ± 8 beats/min, p < 0. 001) 20 min after <b>landiolol</b> initiation. However, systolic and diastolic pressure remained unchanged during administration of <b>landiolol.</b> Although <b>landiolol</b> was discontinued in 2 patients because of sinus bradycardia, no serious complications such as advanced degree atrioventricular block, requiring temporary cardiac pacing, severe hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or deterioration of heart failure were observed in the patients receiving <b>landiolol.</b> ConclusionsLandiolol was safe and effective in reducing oxygen demand of the ischemic heart by reducing only HR without lowering blood pressure in patients with ACS undergoing PCI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Landiolol</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{is a new}} β-adrenergic blocker with a pharmacological {{profile that}} suggests it can be administered safely to patients who have sinus tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia and who require heart rate reduction. This study aimed to investigate whether intraoperative administration of <b>landiolol</b> could {{reduce the incidence of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery. Methods Of the 200 consecutive patients whose records could be retrieved between October 2006 and September 2007, we retrospectively reviewed a total of 105 patients who met the inclusion criteria: no previous permanent/persistent AF, no permanent pacemaker, no renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, and no reactive airway disease, etc. <b>Landiolol</b> infusion was started after surgery had commenced, at an infusion rate of 1 [*]μg/kg/min, titrated upward in 3 – 5 [*]μg/kg/min increments. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those who received intraoperative β-blocker therapy with <b>landiolol</b> (<b>landiolol</b> group) {{and those who did not}} receive any β-blockers during surgery (control group). An unpaired t test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare between-group differences in mean values and categorical data, respectively. Results Seventeen of the 105 patients (16. 2 %) developed postoperative atrial fibrillation: 5 / 57 (8. 8 %) in the <b>landiolol</b> group and 12 / 48 (25 %) in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P= 0. 03). The incidence of AF after valve surgery and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was lower in the <b>landiolol</b> group, although the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions Our retrospective review demonstrated a marked reduction of postoperative AF in those who received <b>landiolol</b> intraoperatively.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{previously}} {{determined the}} pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of <b>landiolol</b> in healthy male volunteers. In this study, we evaluated {{the usefulness of}} target-controlled infusion (TCI) of <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride and determined PK parameters of <b>landiolol</b> in gynecologic patients. METHODS: Nine patients who were scheduled to undergo gynecologic surgery were enrolled. After inducing anesthesia, <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride was administered at the target plasma concentrations of 500 and 1, 000 ng/mL for each 30 min. A total of 126 data points of plasma concentration were collected from the patients and used for the population PK analysis. Furthermore, a population PK model was developed using the nonlinear mixed-effect modeling software. RESULTS: The patients had markedly decreased heart rates (HRs) at 2 min after the initiation of <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride administration; however, their blood pressures did not markedly change from the baseline value. The concentration time course of <b>landiolol</b> was best described by a 2 -compartment model with lag time. The estimate of PK parameters were total body clearance (CL) 34. 0 mL/min/kg, distribution volume of the central compartment (V 1) 74. 9 mL/kg, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) 70. 9 mL/min/kg, distribution volume of the peripheral compartment (V 2) 38. 9 mL/kg, and lag time (ALAG) 0. 634 min. The predictive performance of this model was better {{than that of the}} previous model. CONCLUSION: TCI of <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride is useful for controlling HR, and the PK parameters of <b>landiolol</b> in gynecologic patients were similar to those in healthy male volunteers and best described by a 2 -compartment model with lag time...|$|E
40|$|Although β 1 -blockers {{have been}} perioperatively {{used to reduce}} the cardiac {{disorders}} associated with general anesthesia, {{little is known about}} the mechanistic characteristics of ultra-short-acting highly selective β 1 -blocker <b>landiolol.</b> We studied its membrane-interacting property in comparison with other selective and nonselective β 1 -blockers. Biomimetic membranes prepared with phospholipids and cholesterol of varying compositions were treated with β 1 -selective <b>landiolol</b> and esmolol and nonselective propranolol and alprenolol at 0. 5 – 200 &# 181;M. The membrane interactivity and the antioxidant activity were determined by measuring fluorescence polarization and by peroxidizing membrane lipids with peroxynitrite, respectively. Nonselective β 1 -blockers, but not selective ones, intensively acted on 1, 2 -dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomal membranes and cardiomyocyte-mimetic membranes to increase the membrane fluidity. <b>Landiolol</b> and its inactive metabolite distinctively decreased the fluidity of 1, 2 -dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomal membranes, suggesting that a membrane-rigidifying effect is attributed to the morpholine moiety in <b>landiolol</b> structure but unlikely to clinically contribute to the β 1 -blocking effect of <b>landiolol.</b> Propranolol and alprenolol interacted with lipid raft model membranes, whereas neither <b>landiolol</b> nor esmolol. All drugs fluidized mitochondria-mimetic membranes and inhibited the membrane lipid peroxidation with the potency correlating to their membrane interactivity. <b>Landiolol</b> is characterized as a drug devoid of the interactivity with membrane lipid rafts relating to β 2 -adrenergic receptor blockade. The differentiation between β 1 -blocking selectivity and nonselectivity is compatible with that between membrane noninteractivity and interactivity. The mitochondrial membrane fluidization by <b>landiolol</b> independent of blocking β 1 -adrenergic receptors is responsible for the antioxidant cardioprotection common to nonselective and selective β 1 -blockers...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{dysfunctions}} and pathologies {{associated with}} sepsis, the underlying molecular mechanisms of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) are poorly understood. Endothelin (ET) - 1, a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory peptide, {{is known to}} be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI in a rat model of sepsis. Here, we investigated whether <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride, an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, plays a crucial role in ameliorating and attenuating LPS-induced ALI through modulation of the ET- 1 system. Male Wistar rats at 8 weeks of age were administered with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for three hours (3 h) and some of the LPS-administered rats were continuously treated with <b>landiolol</b> for 3 h. ALI was induced by LPS, including levels of both circulatory and pulmonary TNF-α and IL- 6 but [PaO 2] was significantly decreased. LPS also induced a significant increase in levels of pulmonary ET- 1 and ET-A receptor, but levels of ET-B receptor, which has vasodilating effects, were remarkably diminished. Further, LPS administration upregulated the pulmonary expression of HIF- 1 α. Finally, the treatment of LPS-administered rats with <b>landiolol</b> for 3 h ameliorated and prevented ALI, normalized the altered levels of pulmonary ET- 1 and ET-A receptors. <b>Landiolol</b> also induced significant down-regulation of ET-B receptor in lung tissues in the early hours (phase) of sepsis. However, <b>Landiolol</b> treatment had no effect on the up-regulated inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL- 6) in both plasma and lung tissues during sepsis, and expression of pulmonary HIF- 1 α also remained unchanged after <b>landiolol</b> treatment. Collectively, these data led us to conclude that <b>landiolol</b> may ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI via the pulmonary ET system...|$|E

In November 2013, <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride (Onoact® 50 for Injection, Ono Pharamaceutical, Osaka, Japan) was approved with the indication for “tachyarrhythmia (AF/AFL) in patients with cardiac dysfunction. ” However, clinical experience with this condition is still insufficient.

In addition, collecting data on the mid- and long-term outcomes in patients treated with <b>landiolol</b> which have not been collected in clinical trials are indispensable. MethodsThis prospective survey will involve patients treated with <b>landiolol</b> for the treatment of tachyarrhythmia (AF/AFL) in cardiac dysfunction at Japanese medical facilities from June 2014 to May 2017.

40|$|BackgroundWhile β-blockers can be {{effective}} in controlling tachyarrhythmias after pediatric cardiac surgery, a negative inotropic influence sometimes complicates their use. <b>Landiolol</b> hydrochloride is a novel, ultra-short-acting β-blocker recently developed in Japan. The drug has higher β 1 :β 2 selectivity ratio and a less negative inotropic effect. This study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy and safety of <b>landiolol</b> {{in the management of}} tachyarrhythmias after pediatric cardiac surgery. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on 312 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Twelve patients were treated with <b>landiolol</b> for critical tachyarrhythmia. The mean age of patients was 28. 7 ± 10. 6 months. Five junctional ectopic tachycardia, 2 atrial flutters, 1 paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, 1 atrial fibrillation, 1 atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and 2 excessive sinus tachycardia were treated. ResultsThe mean loading and maintenance doses were 11. 3 ± 4. 0 and 6. 8 ± 0. 9 μg/kg per minute, respectively. Rate control was achieved in all patients. <b>Landiolol</b> reduced the heart rate from 169. 7 ± 11. 4 to 127. 7 ± 7. 5 beats per minute (p < 0. 05) while blood pressure did not significantly change. Tachyarrhythmias were converted to sinus rhythm in 70. 0 % of the cases and the average time needed to achieve heart rate reduction was 2. 3 ± 0. 5 hours. ConclusionsLandiolol was efficacious in treating tachyarrhythmia in pediatric cardiac surgery. The desired negative chronotropic effect was achieved without significant hemodynamic compromise.

40|$|PURPOSE: Gradually {{progressing}} {{contraction of}} airway smooth muscle is suggested {{to be due}} to the Rho-kinase signaling pathway. In our preliminary study in rat tracheas, <b>landiolol,</b> a beta(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist, at high doses caused gradually progressing contraction, and this contraction reached a plateau after 20 min. Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify whether <b>landiolol</b> could stimulate the Rho-kinase pathway or the phosphatidylinositol (PI) response in the rat trachea. METHODS: Seventy-eight male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 350 g were used for the experiments. Their tracheas were cut into 3 -mm-wide ring segments or 1 -mm-wide slices. Measurements of isometric tension and [(3) H] inositol monophosphate (IP(1)) production were conducted, using these tracheal rings or slices. Data values are expressed as means +/- SD, and statistical significance (P < 0. 05) was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: <b>Landiolol</b> (700 microM) -induced contraction was completely inhibited by fasudil at 30 microM, while the landiolol-induced contraction was not inhibited by 4 -diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methobromide (4 -DAMP), ketanserin, or nicardipine. <b>Landiolol</b> did not stimulate IP(1) production.

Hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, and leukocytosis on postoperative day 3 were significantly associated with tachyarrhythmia onset. The incidence of all complications and respiratory complications, including pneumonia, was significantly higher in patients with than in those without tachyarrhythmia. The mortality rate in the tachyarrhythmia group tended to be higher than that in the nontachyarrhythmia group. <b>Landiolol</b> as a treatment for tachyarrhythmia immediately decreased heart rate and safely reduced subsequent respiratory complications. Conclusion: In elderly patients with cardiac disease or hyperlipidemia, surgeons should be alert for the occurrence of tachyarrhythmia after esophagectomy. Postoperative tachyarrhythmia is a marker of morbidities with particular emphasis on respiratory complications. However, it can be adequately managed by <b>landiolol,</b> resulting in fewer respiratory complications. <b>Landiolol</b> might be a safe and convenient agent for managing postoperative tachyarrhythmia after thoracoscopic esophagectomy, resulting in lower mortality and morbidity rates. © 2013 The Japan Esophageal Society and Springer...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundWe {{previously}} {{performed a}} trial of intravenous <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride during and after cardiac surgery (the PASCAL trial) and demonstrated a preventive effect on postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of increasing the dose and administration period of <b>landiolol</b> for prevention of postoperative AF, {{as well as the}} effect of oral bisoprolol in the early postoperative period. Patients and MethodsA total of 105 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to 3 groups: a group receiving intravenous <b>landiolol</b> perioperatively at 5 μg/kg/min for 3 days (group L), a group receiving oral bisoprolol postoperatively together with <b>landiolol</b> (group LB), and a control group without beta-blocker therapy (group C). The primary end point was the presence/absence of postoperative AF. Secondary end points were (1) the early clinical outcome, (2) hemodynamics, (3) cardiac enzymes (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, troponin-I, and human heart fatty acid-binding protein), (4) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and pentraxin- 3, (5) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and (6) brain natriuretic peptide. ResultsPostoperative AF occurred in 14. 5 % of group L, 9. 1 % of group LB, and 35. 3 % of group C. A significant difference was observed between groups LB and C. Significantly higher levels of troponin-I, human heart fatty acid-binding protein, hs-CRP, pentraxin- 3, and ADMA were noted in group C than in groups L and LB. ConclusionsLandiolol and bisoprolol prevented postoperative AF. The anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects of these beta-blockers presumably inhibited the onset of AF...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether adding a low-dose β 1 -blocker to milrinone improves cardiac function in failing cardiomyocytes and the underlying cardioprotective mechanism. BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism underlying how the combination of low-dose β 1 -blocker and milrinone affects intracellular Ca(2 +) handling in heart failure remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated the effect of milrinone plus <b>landiolol</b> on intracellular Ca(2 +) transient (CaT), cell shortening (CS), the frequency of diastolic Ca(2 +) sparks (CaSF), and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) concentration ({Ca(2 +) }SR) in normal and failing canine cardiomyocytes and used immunoblotting to determine the phosphorylation level of ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) and phospholamban (PLB). RESULTS: In failing cardiomyocytes, CaSF significantly increased, and peak CaT and CS markedly decreased compared with normal myocytes. Administration of milrinone alone slightly increased peak CaT and CS, while CaSF greatly increased with a slight increase in {Ca(2 +) }SR. Co-administration of β 1 -blocker <b>landiolol</b> to failing cardiomyocytes at a dose that does not inhibit cardiomyocyte function significantly decreased CaSF with a further increase in {Ca(2 +) }SR, and peak CaT and CS improved compared with milrinone alone. <b>Landiolol</b> suppressed the hyperphosphorylation of RyR 2 (Ser 2808) in failing cardiomyocytes but had no effect on levels of phosphorylated PLB (Ser 16 and Thr 17). Low-dose <b>landiolol</b> significantly inhibited the alternans of CaT and CS under a fixed pacing rate (0. 5 Hz) in failing cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: A low-dose β 1 -blocker in combination with milrinone improved cardiac function in failing cardiomyocytes, apparently by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RyR 2, not PLB, and subsequent diastolic Ca(2 +) leak...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimsEndothelin (ET) - 1 is {{the best}} known potent {{vasoconstrictor}} and has been implicated in pathogenesis of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in human or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced AKI in animal models. We have previously shown that ET- 1 is highly up-regulated in renal tissues and in plasma after LPS administration. Here, we investigated whether <b>landiolol</b> hydrochloride, an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker, {{can play an important}} role in ameliorating levels of LPS-induced up-regulation of renal HIF- 1 α–ET- 1 system and inflammatory cytokines in a rat model of endotoxemia. Main methodsMale Wistar rats at 8 weeks of age were either administered with: a) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only for three hours (3 h) or b) LPS, followed by continuous administration of <b>landiolol</b> for 3 h; c) third group was only treated with vehicle. Key findingsAt 3 h after LPS administration there was: a) minimal injury in kidney tissues; b) circulatory levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and NGAL increased and c) expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL- 6 and iNOS increased at the level of both circulatory and renal tissues. In addition, LPS significantly induced renal expression of ET- 1 and HIF- 1 α compared to control. Finally, treatment of LPS-administered rats with <b>landiolol</b> for 3 h normalized elevated serum markers of renal injury and up-regulated levels of renal HIF- 1 α–ET- 1 system with normalization of TNF-α. SignificanceTaken together, these data led us to conclude that <b>landiolol</b> ameliorates the up-regulation of HIF- 1 α–ET- 1 system in minimally morphologically-injured kidney and normalizes biomarkers of renal injury in early hours of endotoxemia of a rat model...|$|E
