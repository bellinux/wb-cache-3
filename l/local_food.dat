40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the process of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> and the social impacts on the local society, using a case of Shiraoi, Hokkaido. Especially, two main points below are considered. 1) To figure out the effectivity of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> for conscientization of local people about their own community design. 2) To consider the possibility of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> as the way of community design. The contexts {{of this study are}} the rise of public interest on food issues and diversification of tourism form. Also, as the way of community design, the activity of cooperation between <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> and tourism is getting high attention. Because it costs less money to appeal local area, it is convenient way for a local autonomy which is under a severe economic situation. The way of research is divided into two parts. The first part (Part I: Chapter 1 - 2) is a review of previous research. The second part (Part II: Chapter 3 - 4) is a case study research, based on primary resources. Specifically, this part is constructed from two parts. The first part is a survey of the process of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> and the second part is an analysis of process of local people's conscientization in the activity of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods.</b> In Part I, a review of previous research about recent tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> and the meaning of this study are explained. In Part II, general information of Shiraoi, which is a case study, and the process of the activity of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> in Shiraoi, which is called "Shiraoi Burger & Bagel" are reviewed, first. Next, according to the results of interviews and questionnaires to local people who are involved the activity, their conscious transformation by the activity of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> is demonstrated. In Part III, based on the discussion of Part I and Part II, the economic impacts and social impacts of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> on <b>local</b> society and local people are analyzed. Also, problems and ideal way of tourism-use of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> as the way of community design are considered. 本研究では、地場食材の観光活用に取り組んでいる北海道白老町を事例として、以下の二点を明らかにすることを目的としている。１）地場食材の観光活用手法として、近年注目を集めるご当地グルメに着目し、その地域に与える社会的インパクトを明らかにすること。特に、取り組みによる、地域住民の意識変化や行動変化が起こっているかどうかを探ること。２）上記の事例分析を踏まえ、地場食材の観光活用の一形態としてのご当地グルメのあり方について、その今後の課題と可能性を検討すること。研究の背景としては、近年各地におけるご当地グルメの取り組み数の増加に伴い、それらに関する研究も増加傾向にある一方で、その地域ブランド戦略など研究分野に偏りがあり、特にご当地グルメの取り組みが地域に与えるインパクトに関する研究蓄積はまだまだ少ないという現状がある。なかでも社会的インパクトに注目する理由には、 1 ：経済的インパクトに比べて数値化が難しく、その分析方法論も発展段階にあることから、特に研究蓄積が少ないという問題意識、 2 ：地域社会やその地域に存在する社会集団、個人などの変化・変容を意味する社会的インパクトを分析することで、より地域の特徴に沿った事業展開が可能になる、 3 ：現在、地域開発の分野で注目を集める社会開発の理論を援用しようという試み、の三つがある。研究方法は大きく分けて、文献整理による先行研究のレビュー（第I部：第 1 ～ 2 章）と現地行政提供資料と現地調査によって得た一次資料を基にした、現地における地場食材の観光活用に関する活動経過の整理とそれに伴う活動関係者の意識変化・行動変化分析（第II部：第 3 ～ 4 章）による。第I 部では、先行研究の整理と既存研究における本研究の位置づけを行った。第II部では、事例地域である白老町の概要と白老町で行われているご当地グルメ、「白老バーガー＆ベーグル」の取り組みの展開について整理を行うとともに、現地調査から得た情報から白老バーガー＆ベーグルの取り組みに伴う活動関係者の意識変化および行動変化について明らかにした。そして第III部では、白老バーガー＆ベーグルの地域への経済的インパクトおよび社会的インパクトを明らかにした上で、地場食材の観光活用の一形態としてのご当地グルメの今後の課題と展望について検討を行った...|$|R

40|$|The {{supply chain}} {{management}} of foods is commonly associated with modernistic large-scale production. This involves long transport distances of foods to reach consumers. In the case of <b>local</b> <b>foods,</b> supply chains are shorter. Based on {{a case study of}} five <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> producer's supply of their products to a common retailer, the supply chain of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> is modelled conceptually and modes of development are pointed out based on contingency theory and {{supply chain management}} literature. Findings reveal that since these chains are transparent, reciprocal interdependency is abundant mainly because human perception creates a sufficient understanding of the operations management issues pertinent within this simple inter-organisational structure. <b>Local</b> <b>foods</b> supply chains are similar to service supply chains. This includes that both are short in nature and associated with bi-directional interaction between the customer and supplier. Developing short supply chains in <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> supply is associated with improving the exchange economy found in short supply chains. This also implies that development of <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> supply is associated with two paths which may be complementary. First, the use of improved intensive technology associated with reciprocal interdependency to develop efficiencies in the bi-directional and somewhat complex interaction. Alternatively <b>local</b> <b>foods</b> suppliers may seek to reduce this form of reciprocal interdependency thereby increasing the impact of pooled interdependencies and enabling using mediating technology involving standardising interaction such as through increased standardised products and packaging as well as automation of information connectivity...|$|R

A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

5|$|Sheep are an {{important}} part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and <b>local</b> <b>food</b> customers. Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E
5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only <b>local</b> <b>food.</b> They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E

Example of Sabah-based companies promoting dairy product and state drinks are like the Desa Cattle, Tenom coffee and Sabah Tea. The indigenous people features a number of alcoholic drinks such as bahar, kinomol, lihing, montoku, sagantang, sikat and tuak; with the state itself becoming the third highest in alcohol consumption in the country after Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak. The English Tea House and Restaurant in Sandakan is another attraction promoting the British tea culture. Other international shops and restaurants such as for Western food, Middle Eastern food, Bruneian food, Indonesian food, Filipino food, Japanese food, Korean food, Taiwanese food, Thai food and Vietnamese food have their presence here.

5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging <b>local</b> <b>food</b> markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{political}} consciousness started after {{the establishment of}} the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to lourdes central school protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of Dabbawalas (lunch box delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British people who came to Bombay did not like the <b>local</b> <b>food.</b> So the Dabbawala service was set up to bring lunch to these people in their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.|$|E
