40|$|Accurate severe {{thunderstorm}} forecasts {{are critical}} to providing sufficient leadtime to protect lives and property. The Air Force Weather Agency has developed a 3 -Element Severe Weather Forecast Algorithm that when applied to model forecasts gives and outlook region for severe thunderstorms. Improvements were made in this study to enhance the algorithm's forecast skill, reduce its "false alarm" rate, and thereby {{increase the amount of}} <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> <b>installation</b> commanders to take decisive action to protect personnel and resources. This paper discusses the performance of the 3 -Element Algorithm in its original form, and the adjustments made to overcome some of its limitations. The 3 -Element Algorithm techniques and results of a performance evaluation are presented. Based on the amount of forecast improvement, eight configurations were retained for analysis across the entire dataset containing six severe weather cases. A new stability proxy, the Elevated Total-Totals Index, was developed and integrated into the algorithm to improve severe weather forecasts over high-elevation regions where some traditional severe weather indices cannot be accurately computed. Additionally, the horizontal gradient of convective available potential energy was studied as a new indicator to the presence of dynamic forcing. It is hoped that improvements discussed in this paper will make the 3 -Element Algorithm an effective tool in the early forecasting of severe weather, increasing lead-time to safeguard lives and resources.

50|$|WoF Tornado Threat Prediction (WoF-TTP) is a {{research}} project to develop a 0-1 hour, 1-km resolution suite of highly detailed computer models to forecast individual convective storms and their potential tornadoes. Target future average <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> tornado warnings via WoF-TTP is 40-60 minutes. The technology and science developed to achieve the WoF-TTP goal will likely improve the predictionof other convective weather threats such as large hail and damaging winds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{processing}} speed {{of computers and}} availability of spatial hydrologic data make distributed watershed models a viable approach for many applications, including peak flow forecast-ing. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using radar precipitation data with a distributed water-shed model to obtain increased <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> peak flow forecasting. The CASC 2 D watershed model {{is applied to the}} Hassyampa River watershed in central Arizona using radar-based rainfall estimates from the National Weather Service WSR- 88 D weather radar. An application of radar rainfall data as input to the CASC 2 D model is then presented by which precipitation forecasts are generated by extrapolation of precipitation patterns from radar images. The calibrated model is run for two rainfall events: with and without linear precipitation forecasts. Results of this study confirm that the precipitation forecasts based on extrapolation of rainfall patterns from radar can produce increases in the forecast <b>lead-time.</b> <b>For</b> the two events presented, the forecast lead-time was increased by four to five hours, which can be significant when issuing flood warnings...|$|R

40|$|Exponential {{smoothing}} {{is often}} used to forecast <b>lead-time</b> demand <b>for</b> inventory control. In this paper, formulae are provided for calculating means and variances of <b>lead-time</b> demand <b>for</b> a wide variety of exponential smoothing methods. A feature of many of the formulae is that variances, as well as the means, depend on trends and seasonal effects. Thus, these formulae provide the opportunity to implement methods that ensure that safety stocks adjust to changes in trend or changes in season.

Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and vinyl ester resins, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant thermoset polymer matrix composite parts.|$|R

50|$|In the United States and Canada, {{timber-frame}} {{construction has}} been revived since the 1970s, {{and is now}} experiencing a thriving renaissance of the ancient skills. This {{is largely due to}} such practitioners as Steve Chappell, Jack Sobon, and Tedd Benson, who studied old plans and techniques and revived a long-neglected technique. Once a handcrafted skill passed down, timber-frame construction has now been modernized with the help of modern industrial tools such as CNC machines. These machines and mass-production techniques have assisted growth and made for more affordable frames and shorter <b>lead-times</b> <b>for</b> projects.|$|R
30|$|At plants, {{components}} are assembled to products of different types. Product types differ regarding their combination of components, i.e. {{at least one}} component in the product composition has to be different in different products. Components can be product type-specifically or commonly used among different product types. They are shipped from suppliers or remanufacturing centres to plants and can be held on inventory at plants. No final products are stored in the studied network and products are assembled only if an order exists (MTO).

The three events considered are: Nanmadol (Aug 29 – 31, 2010), Saola (June 9 – 12, 2012), and Soulik (July 12 – 14, 2013). Rainfall data used in early warning include QPEs and QPFs with a 3 -h <b>lead-time</b> <b>for</b> establishing rainfall threshold curves from the physical-based slope stability model and real-time simulation methods.
