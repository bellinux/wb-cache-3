5000|$|From the mid-1910s {{into the}} early '20s, as hemlines rose from ankle length to mid-calf, high-heeled Russian boots with pointe or rounded toes, were {{increasingly}} popular. [...] They were available {{in a variety of}} styles, calf- or knee-length, with a Cuban or <b>Louis</b> <b>heel,</b> which could be pull-on, or zip-fastened for a closer fit. Worn with calf-length and finally knee-length skirts, they often featured decorative features such as elaborate stitching or fur trim. Russian boots were stylish throughout the 1920s as the fashionable alternative to galoshes in winter. They also somehow acquired a racy reputation, as the sort of footwear worn by girls who frequented saloon bars and speakeasies.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th Centuries, ankle and calf-length boots were common {{footwear}} for women. Rising hemlines made longer styles of boots popular. In 1913, Denise Poiret, {{the wife of}} celebrated French couturier Paul Poiret, caused a sensation in Paris and New York by wearing knee-length boots in wrinkled Morocco leather. Designed by her husband, made by the bottier Favereau, and styled with a low heel and a square toe, she had versions in red, white, green, and yellow. By 1915 The New York Times was reporting that, inspired by Mme Poiret, women had adopted these [...] "Russian boots" [...] as an acceptable alternative to baring ankles and calves. By the 1920s Russian boots were available {{in a variety of}} styles, calf- or knee-length, with a Cuban or <b>Louis</b> <b>heel,</b> which could be pull-on, or zip-fastened for a closer fit. Worn with knee-length skirts, they often featured decorative features such as elaborate stitching or fur trims.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. <b>Louis</b> <b>heeled</b> over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|R
5000|$|Anello & Davide are {{occasionally}} credited as the shoemakers {{who made}} the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz. This is not the case, as surviving shoes for the 1939 film are clearly labelled as being from the Innes Shoe Company in Los Angeles. On their website, Anello & Davide simply state they have been [...] "called upon to create unforgettable cinema icons - such as Dorothy's unforgettable red slippers [...] The Wizard of Oz.". It is more probable that the firm provided the plain red leather shoes with <b>Louis</b> <b>heels</b> that were customised for the 1985 film Return To Oz, {{or at the very}} least, made replicas for stage productions.|$|R
60|$|BELLO: (Gaily) Right. Let {{them all}} come.

Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch <b>Louis</b> Quinze <b>heels,</b> the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.|$|R

25|$|Far to the east, {{a column}} of French conscripts under Jacob Job Élie, set out from Philippeville toward Beaumont.
