Geopipe highlights this function, and also geonets, geocomposites and very thick geotextiles. Drainage applications for these different geosynthetics are retaining walls, sport fields, dams, canals, reservoirs, and capillary breaks. Also to be noted is that sheet, edge and wick drains are geocomposites used for various soil and rock drainage situations.|$|E

25|$|Geo{{textiles}} {{form one}} of the two largest groups of geosynthetics. They are textiles consisting of synthetic fibers rather than natural ones such as cotton, wool, or silk. This makes them less susceptible to bio-degradation. These synthetic fibers are made into flexible, porous fabrics by standard weaving machinery or are matted together in a random non woven manner. Some are also knitted. Geotextiles are porous to <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> across their manufactured plane and also within their thickness, but to a widely varying degree. There are at least 100 specific application areas for geotextiles that have been developed; however, the fabric always performs at least one of four discrete functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and/or drainage.|$|E
25|$|Features {{shown by}} the Viking orbiters in 1976 {{revealed}} two possible ancient shorelines near the pole, Arabia and Deuteronilus, each thousands of kilometers long. Several physical features in the present geography of Mars suggest the past existence of a primordial ocean. Networks of gullies that merge into larger channels imply erosion by a <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> and resemble ancient riverbeds on Earth. Enormous channels, 25km wide and several hundred meters deep, appear to have flowed directly from underground aquifers in the Southern uplands into the Northern plains. Much of the northern hemisphere of Mars is at a significantly lower elevation {{than the rest of}} the planet (the Martian dichotomy), and is unusually flat. The low elevation would cause water, if it existed, to gather there. An ocean would tend to level out the ground underneath it.|$|E

2500|$|The frit FAB and {{continuous}} flow-FAB (CF-FAB) interfaces {{were developed in}} 1985 and 1986 respectively. Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a probe tip. From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a [...] LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform liquid film at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> rates of only 1-15 μl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order {{to be used in}} FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of electrospray based interfaces in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|The Reynolds number (...) is an {{important}} dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics used to help predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. At low Reynolds numbers flow tends {{to be dominated by}} laminar (sheet-like) flow, but at high Reynolds numbers turbulence results from differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may sometimes intersect or even move counter to the overall direction of the flow (eddy currents). These eddy currents begin to churn the flow, using up energy in the process, and for liquids increasing the chances of cavitation. Reynolds number has wide applications, ranging from <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> in a pipe to the passage of air over an aircraft wing. It is used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and used in the scaling of similar but different-sized flow situations, such as between an aircraft model in a wind tunnel and the full size version. The predictions of the onset of turbulence and the ability to calculate scaling effects can be used to help predict fluid behaviour on a larger scale, such as in local or global air or water movement and thereby the associated meteorological and climatological effects.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, {{the fluid}} dynamic {{interaction}} of particles suspended in a flow were investigated. The drag forces exerted on the particles by the relative velocity by {{them and the}} flow were treated as additional forces acting on the particles. Therefore, these multiphase flow phenomena including a solid e.g.~particulate and a gaseous or fluid phase resolve the particulate phase by discrete methods, while gas or <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> is described by continuous methods, and therefore, is labelled the combined continuum and discrete model (CCDM) as applied by Kawaguchi et al., Hoomans, Xu 1997 and Xu 1998. [...] Due to a discrete description of the solid phase, constitutive relations are omitted, and therefore, leads {{to a better understanding}} of the fundamentals. This was also concluded by Zhu 2007 et al. and Zhu 2008 et al. during a review on particulate flows modelled with the CCDM approach. It has seen a mayor development in last two decades and describes motion of the solid phase by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on an individual particle scale and the remaining phases are treated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the method is recognized as an effective tool to investigate into the interaction between a particulate and fluid phase as reviewed by Yu and Xu, Feng and Yu [...] and Deen et al. [...] Based on the CCDM methodology the characteristics of spouted and fluidised beds are predicted by Gryczka et al.|$|E

The A.V.

His <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> crams {{an awful lot of}} polysyllabic words into even the tawdriest sex jam, and no rapper alive conveys joy as effortlessly or infectiously". Giving it 2½ out of 4 stars, Los Angeles Times critic August Brown called Battle of the Sexes [...] "another welcome occasion to listen to Luda enjoying the real love of his life -- the sound of his own voice", and described its music as [...] "fizzy pillow talk and respectfully tawdry club fodder". Despite viewing Ludacris's lyrics as from the male perspective, USA Todays Elysa Gardner commended him for his humor and wrote that the album is [...] "more appealing, and more artful, when Ludacris directs his crude, breezy rhymes where they're best suited: into unabashed displays of loopy lust and boneheaded bravado". XXL writer Rondell Conway gave Battle of the Sexes an XL rating and shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Luda may not have evened the playing field, but he certainly created an excellent musical forum for the sexes to air out their differences".

40|$|Gas-liquid mass {{transfer}} {{has been studied}} in a membrane module with non-wetted microporous fibres in the laminar flow regime. This new type of gas/liquid contactor can be operated stabily over a large range of gas and <b>liquid</b> <b>flows</b> because gas and liquid phase do not influence each other directly. Therefore foam is not formed in the module, gas bubbles are not entrained in the <b>liquid</b> <b>flowing</b> out of the reactor and the separation of both phases can be achieved very easily. These phenomena often limit the applicability of conventional contactors, e. g. a bubble column which was also studied in the present work. The large {{mass transfer}} area of a bundle of small fibres offers the possibility of creating a compact gas/liquid mass exchanger. However, owing to the small channels {{in and around the}} fibres the flow of either gas or liquid becomes laminar which reduces the mass transfer capacity of the module. Therefore the mass transfer coefficients in the laminar flow regime were determined experimentally. For mass transfer determined by the transport in the liquid phase {{it was found that the}} active mass transfer area is equal to the total membrane area, regardless the porosity of the fibre. For processes with <b>liquid</b> <b>flowing</b> through the fibres, the influence of fibre diameter, diffusivity in the liquid, liquid viscosity and liquid velocity on mass transfer can be correlated extremely well with the Graetz-Lévèque solution derived for the analogous case of heat transfer. For <b>liquid</b> <b>flowing</b> around regularly packed fibres mass transfer was described satisfactory with a correlation derived from a numerical solution for the similar heat transfer problem [Miyatake and Iwashita, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 33 (1990) 416]. Correlating mass transfer in <b>liquid</b> <b>flowing</b> around irregularly packed fibres was not possible because of the undefined dimensions of the different channels between the fibres...|$|R
