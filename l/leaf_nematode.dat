50|$|Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Black currant nematode, Chrysanthemum foliar nematode, Chrysanthemum <b>leaf</b> <b>nematode,</b> Chrysanthemum nematode, Chrysanthemum Foliar eelworm) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It {{was first}} scientifically described in 1890 in England. This nematode {{has a wide}} host range. Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries. A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode. It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage. When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue. Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves. Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult. A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs. This pest {{can be difficult to}} control. Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended.|$|E

50|$|Ultra low volume (ULV) fogging {{machines}} are cold fogging machines that use {{large volumes of}} air at low pressures to transform liquid into droplets that are dispersed into the atmosphere. This type of fogging machine can produce extremely small droplets with diameters ranging from 1-150 µm. ULV {{machines are}} used for applying pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, sterilizers, and disinfectants amongst other chemicals. The size of the droplet is very important as each application has an optimal droplet size. The optimum droplet sizes are between 5 and 20 µm for flying insects, 20 to 40 µm for <b>leaf</b> <b>nematodes</b> and 30 to 50 µm for fungi.Low volume refers to the low volume of carrier fluid that is required with these types of machines. The droplets that are created are of such a small size that less carrier for the formulation is required to cover the required surface area. The best way to {{understand the concept of}} using less formulation to cover a larger surface area {{is to look at the}} mathematical side of the scenario. In the case where the diameter of a droplet is reduced to half its original size then the amount of droplets that can be formed from the same volume of formulation will increase eightfold. If the droplet diameter is reduced to 10 percent of its original size, then the amount of droplets that can be formed will increase a thousandfold. In this way the droplet diameter determines the amount of droplets that will form.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{transmission}} of North American nepoviruses by putative species {{belonging to the}} Xiphinem ~ americanum-group is reviewed. Xiphinema americanum sensu stricto, X. californicum, and X. rivesi each transmit cherry rasp leaf (CRLV), tobacco ringspot (TobRSV), and tomato ringspot nepovirus (TomRSV), and X. bricolensis i a vector of TomRSV. The apparent lack of specificity in the {{transmission of}} North American nepoviruses by X. ame~qcanum-group species markedly contrasts with the specific associations between European epoviruses and their vector nematode species. Two complementary projects are described examining the taxonomic identity of putative species in the X. ame~canum-group, their morphological nd genetic relationships, their ontogeny, {{and their ability to}} transmit viruses. Key words: cherry rasp <b>leaf</b> virus, <b>nematode,</b> peach rosette mosaic virus, specificity, taxonomy, tobacco ringspot virus, tomato ringspot virus, Xiphinema. Interest in the transmission of plant vi-ruses by plant-parasitic nematodes devel-oped after the initial report, in 1958, that grapevine fan leaf nepovirus was naturally transmitted by Xiphinema index in Califor-nian vineyards (14). The following year, X. americanum was reported as a natural vec-tor of tomato ringspot nepovirus (2). Sub-sequently, this species was reported to transmit obacco ringspot, peach rosette mosaic and cherry rasp leaf nepoviruses (9, 16, 22). Xiphinema americanum-group nematodes reproduce by parthenogenesis (males are rare), which reduces genetic variability. The taxonomy of the group is based on the morpho-species concept, with species distinguished on relatively minor morphological differences (13).

Overall, the prevalence of GFLV (the percentage of vineyards with GFLV) was 24 Â· 3 %, and it was most common in the Jerez-XérÃ¿s-Sherry and Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda denomination of origin (DO) (29 Â· 4 %) and Condado de Huelva DO (24 Â· 0 %), followed by the Montilla-Moriles DO (13 Â· 3 %). GFLV-infected plants showed fanleaf and yellow mosaic symptoms together with general vine decline. In almost all samples, except one from Jerez-XérÃ¿s-Sherry and Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda DO and one from Condado de Huelva DO, GFLV-infected plants showed soil infestation by the virus vector nematode species Xiphinema index and/or the potential vector X. italiae. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) successfully amplified the partial CP gene product of the expected size (555 bp) in leaves and nematode vectors. A total of 135 clones of the partial GFLV CP gene were analysed for sequence variation using single-strand conformation polymorphism, yielding 12 different haplotype patterns. Haplotypes were separated among the three different DO. The haplotype patterns MOB, MOC, MMA, MMC and HB were detected in <b>leaf</b> samples and <b>nematode</b> vectors for each locality, except for Jerez de la Frontera- 429. Sequence analysis of the GFLV haplotypes revealed sequence variability within the haplotypes and greater abundance of some variants than others in the same sequenced haplotype pattern.
