40|$|An {{increasing}} number of radio stations nowadays opts for market research on audience shares and music evaluation. Such research can be analysed using general programmes and solutions, such as SPSS and different data warehouse solutions, but there is lack of specialised software that would offer such analysis. The topic of the diploma thesis is Polling Data Analysis, which represents <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> for Microsoft Excel. <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> enables <b>the</b> transformation of input, which must be in SPSS file, into more transparent tables and more precise analyses in Excel. It is designed specifically for radio stations, as it allows fast, simple and inexpensive analysis of data, obtained through telephone surveys on the musical taste of the audience. The development of <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> provides an inexpensive and easy-to-use tool, whose main advantages are {{the fact that it}} is user-friendly and that its operation does not require costly infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{aimed to}} create a syntax support add-in for writing {{business}} rules in Excel. More specifically {{the goal was to}} support business rules written according to the Semantics of Business Rules and Vocabulary standard. <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> developed aimed to support the writing of the rules by providing syntax highlighting, content assist and validation. The implementation gave rise to many interesting challenges. This was partly because Excel had to be altered in order to function as a syntax support tool, by having dynamic input and feedback. The implementation also included parsing structured natural language. The final phase of the thesis work was to evaluate the end product. The evaluation of the efficiency, usability and correctness of the tool showed that the aim of the thesis was reached.

40|$|In recent years, Component {{models have}} become common for desktop and {{server-side}} applications. But {{it has not}} obtained such importance in case of embedded real-time systems.   Therefore, {{there has been a}} lot of research undergoing for introducing such component models for embedded real-time systems.   This thesis work proposes an alternative approach for doing this, by the generation of proxies.    The idea is to provide an extension to an existing binary component and modify it to adapt to the targeted real-time operating system. Rather than modifying the existing component, a new component is generated, which is called as the proxy component.   This newly generated proxy component provides the same method implementation as the original component and also provides some additional services.  These services enable these components to meet the needs of targeted embedded real-time systems.   In order to achieve this, a Visual Studio 2008 add-in has been created. This add-in is capable of inspecting an existing Smart Device Component and visualizes the Classes, Interfaces and Methods in the original component in its UI.   In addition to this, <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> also shows <b>the</b> available services to be included in the proxy component.   The UI of <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> is designed in such a way that, the user is able to select the services, which should be included in the proxy component.   Based on the user’s selection, <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> generates <b>the</b> proxy component with the additional services...|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{shift in}} the {{delivery}} of publications, and in the consumption of content, from print to digital presents an opportunity to streamline the publishing workflow and to optimize the authoring process with digital content as the primary output, including the capture of semantics and metadata as part of authoring and the preservation of this data to the archival copy of the document. ? In addition to the shift in how content is delivered and consumed, a significant development {{in the last few years}} has been the release of new versions of word processors with native file formats based on XML. ? The use of XML in the authoring file format, combined with extensibility in its content model, will enable a greater level of content semantics and metadata to be expressed directly by authors. ? The level of interoperability enabled by XML-based word processing file formats will make it possible to preserve the semantics and metadata as documents go through the submission and review process, make it through the publishing workflow and are ultimately archived, likely also in an XML based format. ? This article describes the design considerations and possible benefits of <b>the</b> Article Authoring <b>Add-in</b> for Word 2007 to the scholarly publishing community, in particular for workflows focused on the production of documents for digital delivery and consumption, as well as for the XML based archival of publications. ? The second Beta release of <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> is available as a free download ([URL] and it is currently being evaluated by the scholarly publishing community, with the involvement of publishers, archives, information repositories, and early adopters. ? In addition to facilitating the creation of structured documents, and enabling semantics and metadata to be more easily captured during authoring, <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> provides <b>the</b> ability to open and save files from Word 2007 into the XML format defined by the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the National Library of Medicine. ? <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> extends <b>the</b> file format used by Word 2007, as well as its user interface, to tailor the authoring experience for the different audiences involved in the publishing workflow. ? As <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> is adopted across multiple publications, authors will benefit from a consistent baseline experience, simplifying the authoring process and enabling a shift towards emphasising the expression of semantics over presentation by authors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the current}} era of {{scientific}} research, efficient {{communication of information}} is paramount. As such, the nature of scholarly and scientific communication is changing; cyberinfrastructure is now absolutely necessary and new media are allowing information and knowledge to be more interactive and immediate. One approach to making knowledge more accessible is the addition of machine-readable semantic data to scholarly articles. Results <b>The</b> Word <b>add-in</b> presented here will assist authors in this effort by automatically recognizing and highlighting words or phrases that are likely information-rich, allowing authors to associate semantic data with those words or phrases, and to embed that data in the document as XML. <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> and source code are publicly available at [URL]. Conclusions <b>The</b> Word <b>add-in</b> for ontology term recognition {{makes it possible for}} an author to add semantic data to a document as it is being written and it encodes these data using XML tags that are effectively a standard in life sciences literature. Allowing authors to mark-up their own work will help increase the amount and quality of machine-readable literature metadata. </p...|$|R
40|$|Architecture {{decisions}} {{are often not}} explicitly documented in practice but reside in the architect's mind as tacit knowledge, even though explicit capturing and documentation of architecture decisions {{has been associated with}} a multitude of benefits. As part of a research collaboration with ABB, we developed a tool to document architecture decisions. This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate <b>the</b> <b>add-in,</b> we conducted an exploratory case study with ABB architects. In the study, we assessed the status quo of architecture decision documentation, identified architects' expectations of the ideal decision documentation tool, and evaluated <b>the</b> new <b>add-in.</b> We found that although awareness of decision documentation is increasing at ABB, several barriers exist that limit the use of decisions in practice. Regarding their ideal tool, architects want a descriptive and efficient approach. Supplemental features like reporting or decision sharing are requested. <b>The</b> new <b>add-in,</b> was well-perceived by the architects. As a result of the study, we propose a clearer separation of problem, outcomes, and alternatives for the decision documentation framework...|$|R

This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate <b>the</b> <b>add-in,</b> we conducted a case study with architects from ABB. In this study, we assessed to what extent and why software architects intend to use our approach. We therefore investigated the perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and contextual factors threat influence the architect’s intention to use the tool. We found that the tool has a high relevance for software architects, that it increases the quality of decision documentation and that it improves productivity of architects in various ways. With respect to ease-of-use, the study identified the need for better guidelines.
