The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E
500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the <b>Lights</b> <b>Come</b> On", came on 14 August 2006. Turner {{said that the}} song {{was one of the}} last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it feels very much like it could be on the album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E

[...] Scott Schetler from AOL Radio Blog noted how Diddy referenced a different popular song in each verse. Lamb particularly noted the strong autobiographical lyrics, and the references to the 1979 hit song [...] "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" [...] by McFadden & Whitehead. Other songs referenced include Dionne Warwick's [...] "A House Is Not a Home" [...] (1964) and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' [...] "The Tears of a Clown" [...] (1970). Rodriguez said [...] "Diddy do some soul-searching in his rhymes as the chorus echoes his need for salvation." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{is trying}} to get the Doctor's (Matt Smith) {{attention}} while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The <b>lights</b> <b>come</b> on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the <b>lights</b> <b>come</b> on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's important here is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis. Genius. Pop auteur." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game's story {{picks up}} {{shortly after the}} end of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, with the hero of the series, Sam [...] "Serious" [...] Stone, {{continuing}} his goal to defeat his nemesis, Mental. The game begins with Serious Sam being summoned before the Sirian Great Council, where the Council provides him with guidance on how to accomplish his goal to defeat Mental. The Council reveals to Sam that he must collect all five pieces of an ancient Sirian medallion, each held by various groups on five different planets, and states that once Sam has the entire medallion, Mental will be vulnerable. All the planets (except Kleer) are populated by friendly, bobble-headed humanoids, {{but the problem is that}} all the planets are under Mental's control. The Council then instructs Sam to visit all five planets in order to recreate the medallion, only then will Sam become [...] "The One". Confused at the moment and with nothing better to do, Sam accepts the mission. With the medallion finally complete, Sam is now ready to begin the final assault against the greatest enemy of humanity...Mental, who is located on Sirius, once the planet of the great Sirians that visited Earth many times, now the domain of Mental himself. But in order to gain access to Sirius, Sam is asked to storm Kronor, a moon orbiting Sirius that has a massive cannon which could be used to remove Sirius' protection shield, which was a last line of defense for the Sirians against Mental. And so, Sam's mission continues. In the endgame, Sam enters Mental Institution after disabling it and into Mental's throne room. Sam finally encounters Mental in person while the lights are off. Mental tries to reveal to Sam that he is his father, but Sam interrupts by shooting him, thus silencing Mental forever. After that, the Sirian Great Council, even the inhabitants from the planets, celebrate their long-awaited victory against Mental. When the <b>lights</b> <b>come</b> back on however, it is revealed that Mental wasn't there at all and it was instead just a speaker attached to Mental's throne, implying that he actually tricked Sam in order to escape in his starship into deep space (in the Xbox version, the game doesn't show this scene). The credits roll after that, where a dialog of three unknown people is played discussing how this ending might just be another one of Croteam's bad jokes and how big Mental's boss fight could be.|$|E

At twilight, again, the beaten-down ridges and laps and folds of the uplands take on the likeness of wet sand--some huge and melancholy beach at the world's end--and when day meets night it is all goblin country. To westward; the last of the spent day--rust-red and pearl, illimitable levels of shore waiting for the tide to turn again. To eastward, black night among the valleys, and on the rounded hill slopes a hard glaze that is not so much light as snail-slime from the moon. Once or twice perhaps in the winter the Northern <b>Lights</b> <b>come</b> out between the moon and the sun, so that to the two unearthly lights is added the leap and flare of the Aurora Borealis.|$|E
