40|$|Increases in {{the price}} of fuel and capital {{facilities}} have resulted in pressure for "social " rate-making in the electric utility industry. Southern California Edison has proposed a "lifeii~le " subsidy for half a million low-use consumers, with the revenue deficiency l,"",_novered by increasing the charges for consumption above 300 kwh/month by. 001 c/kwh. An alternative social p!ogram involves the use of fuel stamps; experiments with such a program are now'being carried out in Denver and Leheigh Valley. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the two redistribution policies, using the theory of the consumer under nonlinear budget constraints. Because of conflicting social goals, neither approach is ideal, although stamps appear to be a more specific, and thus cheaper, way to increase electricity consumption and/or utility of low income consumers. 1. Lifeline Rates versus the Declining Block The declining block and <b>lifeline</b> <b>rate</b> structures shown in Figure 1 correspond to the budget lines ABCDE and A'B'C'D E', respectively in Figure 2. For simplicity the price per kwh beyond K 2 for declining blocks is the same as the average price per kwh up to Kl. :for lifeline rates, making the slope of CDE (x) the same as IB! Similarly, the slope of IB (z) is the same C'D E'. As drawn, the solid budget line fo...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil its {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} middle-income country, Tanzania is working on improving infrastructure and service delivery in electricity provision, where $ 40 billion investment is needed in the sector to meet rising demand and widening electrification efforts from 2013 to 2035. This paper considers the institutional arrangements for investment in Tanzaniaâs power sector and surveys the track record (and possible bottlenecks) in funnelling investment to the sector, with special attention given to the gas sector, given the power sectorâs planned reliance upon natural gas as a generation fuel. The paper finds that the financial health of TANESCO is central to all investment vehicles, since it is either directly responsible for investment, or indirectly, as the counter party to the variety of PPAs available with IPPs, EPPs, SPPs, or PPPs. During 2011 â 13, the financial position of TANESCO was negatively impacted by the increased of its electricity purchases, while the regulated tariff that it charges has not changed. The cost increase is partially attributable to non-favourable hydrology and partially attributable to the depreciation of Tanzanian shilling against the US dollar, in which PPAs are denominated. Detailed study of the tariff setting methodology in place in Tanzania, as evidenced through its latest tariff review, and evaluation of the ratemaking principles used in the tariff approved in 2013 reveals that the core tension within Tanzaniaâs tariff setting methodology is the trade-off between efficiency, sufficiency, and stability principles. The ex-ante assessment of TANESCOâs revenue requirement, a typical incentive-based price cap regulation, is theoretically efficient but not robust: TANESCOâs costs of service are subject to important external uncertainties like hydrology, currency depreciation, and global fuel prices. In order to take revenue sufficiency into account, the regulator needs to periodically adjust tariffs based on ex post fuel costs and inflation rates. This diminishes the regulatorâs ability to maintain tariff stability, which might impact certain classes of customers more than others (<b>lifeline</b> <b>rate</b> customers and domestic industries). The experiences of other nations, namely Bangladesh and CÃ´te dâIvoire, reveal a potential challenge with regard to power and gas co-development: if non-cost reflective gas tariffs are applied as a regulatory decision, then high gas demand that results from that cannot be indefinitely sustained, since investment in gas supply will not follow suite. The case study of CÃ´te dâIvoire also reveals a less obvious opportunity: periods of low electricity demand can be leveraged positively through electricity exports, which can positively influence investor interest...|$|E

The framework he used serves here {{as the basis for}} comparing <b>lifeline</b> <b>rates,</b> fuel stamps, and direct cash subsidies [...] programs proposed to alleviate the hardships borne by the poor when electricity prices rise substantially. These social programs have redistributive and allocative implications which can be analyzed in the context of multipart block pricing.

Unlike in other countries, family size in Mauritius increases with income. Due to this unusual demographic dimension, increasing block tariffs coupled with <b>lifeline</b> <b>rates</b> that are below long-run marginal cost applicable to low-volume users produce a different result. Regional variations in water demand and extensive metering both in rural and urban areas reinforce the redistributing nature of water charges. Traditional incidence analysis with adjustment for family size, linear expenditure systems approach and interactive demand models empirically support this result. ...|$|R

Recently there has been concern that program participation rates are low {{and that there is}} great variation in participation across states. We examine the Lifeline Program to explain why people do not participate in a program that provides them with financial benefits. Using state-level panel data, we consider reasons Life-line participation varies among states and why only approximately one-third of eligible households nationwide enroll in the program. We find that participation is actually closely aligned with what is predicted given state characteristics when we control for socioeconomic and demo-graphic characteristics.

In any sort of weather above Force 4 the area aft of the upper deck super structure was frequently awash and whilst in Icelandic waters life lines were a permanent feature to allow safe access to the after mess desk, where the stokers and ERAs lived.
