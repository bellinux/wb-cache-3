25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based <b>light</b> <b>dimmer</b> dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} means {{are used to}} control temperature. The {{simplest}} of these is a variable power control, much like a <b>light</b> <b>dimmer,</b> which changes the equilibrium temperature of the iron without automatically measuring or regulating the temperature. Another type of system uses a thermostat, often inside the iron's tip, which automatically switches power on and off to the element. A thermal sensor such as a thermocouple {{may be used in}} conjunction with circuitry to monitor the temperature of the tip and adjust power delivered to the heating element to maintain a desired temperature.|$|E

50|$|Extremely wide {{apertures}} (such as f/1.2 or f/1.4) {{are more}} rarely used, because at these apertures {{the depth of}} field is very shallow, which makes focusing more difficult and slows down autofocus. The main distinction is between outdoor sports and indoor sports - in outdoor sports the distances are greater and the light brighter, while in indoor sports the distances are lesser and the <b>light</b> <b>dimmer.</b> Accordingly, outdoor sports tend to have longer focal length long focus lenses with slower apertures, while indoor sports tend to have shorter lenses with faster apertures.|$|E

50|$|Parts of {{the site}} have already had a redesign, {{including}} a new look for the home page. The Coronation Street, Loose Women and football sections pages were updated {{in the early months}} of 2009. This Morning was relaunched in August. ITV News was relaunched 2010, coinciding with a new Tonight page. On 11 September 2009 video coding was changed from Microsoft Silverlight to Flash, and on 25 September 2009 ITV relaunched its TV classics section. On 19 November ITV Player had a complete overhaul of its site and relaunched with a new Web site with a few new addons, including a search bar, a <b>light</b> <b>dimmer</b> and bigger video players. A Brand New TV Shows directory was relaunched on December 10, which then led to the old style Drama, Soap, Entertainment pages on the site being replaced with similar pages in the TV Shows directory. On 4 February a brand new weather page launched and on 22 February a brand new ITV News Web site launched. Stories from ITV News correspondents, the latest news programme, news blogs and a meet the team page are all on the brand new Web site. From Summer 2010, the ITV Web site underwent another overhaul, with tweaks to the layout such as centring pages when used on wide-screen displays as well as improved pages for various ITV shows with high-resolution images and videos.|$|E
40|$|To {{face the}} {{challenge}} of possible global warming, the governments of developed countries around the world try to cut their carbon emissions by promoting the use of energy efficient appliances such that the standard of living of their people could be maintained with less overall energy consumption [1]. One of their moves is to replace inefficient incandescent lamps with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) with high efficacy through legislation. However the majority of CFL available in the market cannot be used in conjunction with tradition Silicon Controller Rectifier (SCR) light dimmers such that certain replacements cannot be conducted as expected. Moreover, dimming the light output to a desired level is also a way of energy saving without degradation in living quality. Therefore this paper presents a practical <b>light</b> <b>dimmer,</b> which is essentially a dc-dc converter, {{that can be used in}} conjunction with the majority of CFL available in the market and the dimmer can be installed in a wall mountable housing like a conventional dimmer. The paper also provides the measured characteristics of a set of CFL under dimming control and evaluates the overall performance of the proposed <b>light</b> <b>dimmer</b> in conjunction with CFL. Finally, this paper gives a brief discussion on the possible impact on the efficacy and lifetime of CFL used in conjunction with the proposed <b>light</b> <b>dimmer.</b> Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: C.
