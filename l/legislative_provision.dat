500|$|The High Court's {{consideration}} of Section116 {{has generally been}} limited to three areas: the definition of [...] "religion"; the meaning of [...] "law for establishing any religion"; {{and the meaning of}} [...] "law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion". [...] The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court. [...] The court has never ruled a <b>legislative</b> <b>provision</b> to be in contravention of Section116. [...] As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} has been variously interpreted. It can be construed as marking the supremacy of the common law over Parliament by judicial review or only as being another form of statutory interpretation. Noah Feldman suggested that the dispute over the two meanings has its origins in 1930s America, where frustration over judicial review of elements of the New Deal spilled into the academic world. James Kent, in his Commentaries on American Law, argued that Bonham's Case and similar cases meant only that statutes {{should be given a}} [...] "reasonable construction". Charles Gray, in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, argues that Coke, as a judge, never intended to advocate the judicial review of statutes. Bernard Bailyn wrote that [...] "Coke had not meant... 'that there were superior principles of right and justice which Acts of Parliament might not contravene'" [...] and also that by [...] "saying that courts might 'void' a <b>legislative</b> <b>provision</b> that violated the constitution he meant only that the courts were to construe statutes so as to bring them into conformity with recognized legal principles".|$|E

This modified reasonable relation test considers the arbitrariness of the administrative decision. The notion of arbitrariness with regard to an equality clause was elucidated in the Indian case Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978). Here, in reference to Article 14 of the Constitution of India (the equivalent of Article 12 of the Singapore Constitution), the Indian Supreme Court stated that along with the notion of reasonable classification, there must also be a consideration of arbitrariness in an equality clause.

It was in the year 1774 [1773?] we framed an act of Parliament for remedy to the then existing disorders in India, such as the then information before us enabled us to enact. Finding that the act of Parliament did not answer all the ends that were expected from it, we had, in the year 1782, recourse to a body of monitory resolutions. Neither had we the expected fruit from them. When, therefore, we found that our inquiries and our reports, our laws and our admonitions, were alike despised, that enormities increased in proportion as they were forbidden, detected, and exposed,--when we found that guilt stalked with an erect and upright front, and that legal authority seemed to skulk and hide its head like outlawed guilt,--when we found that some of those very persons who were appointed by Parliament to assert the authority of the laws of this kingdom were the most forward, the most bold, and the most active in the conspiracy for their destruction,--then {{it was time for the}} justice of the nation to recollect itself. To have forborne longer would not have been patience, but collusion; it would have been participation with guilt; it would have been to make ourselves accomplices with the criminal.|$|E
40|$|The central {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is to explore the gaps between the normative justifications advanced for language rights and language legislative protection and the effective realisation of those rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> in practice. This objective is achieved by examining the scope and application of language rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> within language legislation in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Drawing on Canadian jurisprudence advocating for language rights to be recognised as “purposeful”, the thesis considers {{the extent to which}} Ireland and the United Kingdom have limited the acceptance of positive obligations as they relate to the provision of language services in the public sphere. In arguing that language rights are distinct in nature, the thesis suggests that in order for language rights to be effectively realised, an approach to language rights and language legislation more generally must be underpinned by a substantive vision of equality, otherwise language rights and <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> merely amount to symbolic recognition and vacuous rhetoric as opposed to being substantive and enabling rights and provisions. Having said that, the thesis also recognises and elucidates the practical difficulties that arise in the realisation of language rights and language <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> and in doing so seeks to stimulate further dialogue about the nature and limits of language rights and language legislation...|$|R

60|$|My Lords, we must insist, on {{the part}} of the House of Commons, we must conjure your Lordships, for the honor of a coördinate branch of the legislature, that, {{whenever}} you are called upon to admit what we have condemned as crimes to be merits, you will at least give us an opportunity of being heard upon the matter,--that you will not suffer Mr. Hastings, when attempting to defend himself against our charges, in an indirect and oblique manner to condemn or censure the House of Commons itself, as having misrepresented to be crimes the acts of a meritorious servant of the public. Mr. Hastings has pleaded a variety of merits, and every one of these merits, without the exception of one of them, have been either directly censured by the House of Commons, and censured as a ground for <b>legislative</b> <b>provision,</b> or they remain upon the records of the House of Commons, with the vouchers for them, and proofs; and though we have not actually come to the question upon every one of them, we had come, before the year 1782, to forty-five direct resolutions upon his conduct. These resolutions were moved by a person to whom this country is under many obligations, and whom we must always mention with honor, whenever we are speaking of high situations in this country, and of great talents to support them, and of long public services in the House of Commons: I mean Mr. Dundas, then Lord Advocate of Scotland, and now one of the principal Secretaries of State, and at the head, and worthily and deservedly at the head, of the East Indian department. This distinguished statesman moved forty-five resolutions, the major part of them directly condemning these very acts which Mr. Hastings has pleaded as his merits, as being delinquencies and crimes. All that the House of Commons implore of your Lordships is, that you will not take these things, which we call crimes, to be merits, without hearing the House of Commons upon the subject-matter of them. I am sure you are too noble and too generous, as well as too just and equitable, to act in such a manner.|$|E

Introduction [...] Methodology [...] Was the {{enactment}} of the CGT regime actuated by a perception that it will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity? [...] Is the perception that the CGT regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity a perception that is largely correct? [...] What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity? [...] What reasons in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity? [...] Is there reasons to expect outcomes that violate horizontal equity (caused by the CGT regime) to be widespread? [...] Overall conclusions, policy implications of them, and delimitations of the research. The research problem addressed in this thesis is: Does the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains cause widespread violation of horizontal equity? The conclusion drawn in this thesis is that there is reason to expect that the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains ("the CGT regime") can cause widespread violation of horizontal equity. That conclusion is reached by seeking answers to five questions: Question 1. Was {{the enactment}} of the CGT regime, and the continuance of it after enactment, actuated by a perception (of respectively the government which enacted it, and subsequent governments which yielded to its continuance) that the regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity?, and, if it was, Question 2. Is that perception largely correct?, and, if it is, Question 3. What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity (that is, outcomes that violate horizontal equity) ?, and, if such reasons exist, Question 4. Do those reasons (or any other) in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity?, and, if they do, Question 5. Is there reason to expect those outcomes to be widespread? [...] This thesis argues that only any one of four reasons can (in theory) cause the CGT regime to potentially produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Those four reasons (designated as respectively Reason A, Reason B, Reason C and Reason D) are: Reason A. The best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason B. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Australian judiciary's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions,</b> not being compatible with the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary), can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason C. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> is not compatible with their best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary). Reason D. Though the Australian judiciary's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (despite not being the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions,</b> based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary) does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> is not compatible with their interpretation by the Australian judiciary (albeit, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary, such interpretation of the Australian judiciary not being compatible with the best interpretation of those <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions).</b> [...] In the arrangements pursuant to which <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> imposing CGT are enacted and implemented, there is an absence of systematic sensitivity to those four reasons. In those arrangements, there is also an absence of institutionalised processes (mandated by legislation or otherwise) for the identification of outcomes that violate horizontal equity, and effecting legislative amendments to prevent such outcomes. Due to those absences, in this thesis, the conclusion is reached that there is reason to expect outcomes from the detailed working of the CGT regime that violate horizontal equity to be widespread. [...] Those four reasons can be effectively addressed through: a consequentialist approach to interpreting <b>legislative</b> <b>provisions</b> imposing CGT, buttressed by legislative directives to the Australian judiciary and other means necessary for making such an approach practicable; post-implementation reviews of CGT measures enacted to ensure that those measures do not cause violation of horizontal equity; and enacting explicit legislative directives essentially precluding the Commissioner from issuing rulings (or any like pronouncements) which are inconsistent with judicial authority. [...] A status quo where there is reason to expect widespread violation of horizontal equity caused by the CGT regime may be perpetuated if those four reasons are not addressed. Such an outcome will retard sound tax administration because the public's willingness to optimally comply with a tax will not be fostered unless the public views that tax as one which satisfies horizontal equity. An absence of optimal compliance will make a tax inefficacious. The CGT may become a tax relegated to such a status if those four reasons are not addressed. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 293...|$|R
