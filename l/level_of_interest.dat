5|$|In September, Alexander {{believed}} {{that he would make}} his final selection with a December verbal commitment and an April signing of his National Letter of Intent. On October 7, the Hoophall Classic schedule was announced and Curie was scheduled to play Montverde Academy on January 20. By some accounts Kansas was a favorite because his girlfriend was a student at Kansas and the 2013–14 Kansas Jayhawks were scheduled to play the 2013–14 Duke Blue Devils at Chicago's United Center in the ESPN Champions Classic on November 12 just before his scheduled announcement. In 2013 Caelynn Manning-Allen became a freshman on the Kansas women's basketball team. However, Illinois was very excited to be in serious contention for Alexander. It was the first time since Derrick Rose in 2006 that a top 5 prospect was still considering Illinois so late into his senior year and Alexander's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> seemed much higher than Rose's. Following his Illinois visit, his scheduled announcement date had moved forward to November 15. On October 31, Alexander officially eliminated Michigan State from his candidate list, leaving Kansas, Illinois, DePaul and Memphis in contention.|$|E
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had {{spent a good deal}} of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates whether short sellers establish {{short positions}} prior to accounting restatement announcements {{and whether the}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> {{are related to the}} severity of restatements. Using 565 firms with restatement disclosure during the period of 1995 to 2002 and matched control firms with no restatements announcements, I find that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> is higher for the sample firms compared to the control firms in the months surrounding the announcements. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> increases as the restatement announcement date approaches and declines thereafter. Related to severity of restatement, I find that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> in the pre-disclosure period is higher for restatements involving fraud and the revenue accounts. There exists limited evidence that the pre-disclosure <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> is positively associated with the number of quarters restated and the magnitude of the restatements. Finally, I find cumulative abnormal returns surrounding the announcements are more negative for restatement firms that have a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest.</b> These results suggest that short sellers are highly sophisticated investors who can see through accounting manipulation and consequently profit from their knowledge...|$|R

25|$|The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{shown by}} women in Australian {{football}} is considered unique among the world's football codes. It {{was the case in}} the 19th-century, as it is in modern times, that women made up approximately half of crowds at Australian football matches—a far greater proportion than soccer and the two rugby codes. This has been attributed in part to the egalitarian character of Australian football's origins in public parks where women could mingle freely and support the game in various ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{significant}} {{interest in}} this martial art, which has {{much in common with}} the many less popular classical Japanese jujutsu schools, is probably due largely to the success of Takeda Sokaku's student Morihei Ueshiba, and the art that he founded, aikido. Aikido is practised internationally and has hundreds of thousands of adherents. Many of those interested in aikido have traced the art's origins back to Daitō-ryū, which has increased the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in an art which was otherwise virtually unknown a few decades before.|$|E

The first order for the BAe 146 was placed by Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas in June 1981.

25|$|The bludger is {{of minor}} {{importance}} to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line as well as gill nets and various types of fish trap. Separate catch statistics are not kept for the species, as it is often not distinguished from other trevallies. The blugder is also of some interest to anglers, although the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> differs between countries. In South Africa it is considered a good catch by boat anglers and spearfishermen and is generally regarded as high quality table fare. In Australia it is still considered a good gamefish, but of a lower caliber than related species such as giant and bluefin trevally, and {{is regarded as a}} poor table fish. Its soft, oily flesh is often used for bait when reef fishing. It may be caught using small baits or lures.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies {{depending}} on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture fund managers in the current climate) finding the fundraising process more tough. It is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> and stock returns in the Nasdaq market from June 1988 through December 1994. We find that heavily shorted firms experience significant negative abnormal returns ranging from � 0. 76 to � 1. 13 percent per month after controlling for the market, size, book-to-market, and momentum factors. These negative returns increase with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest,</b> indicating that a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> is a stronger bearish signal. We find that heavily shorted firms {{are more likely to be}} delisted compared to their size, book-to-market, and momentum matched control firms. WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> and the stock returns in Nasdaq firms. Using monthly short interest data for the universe of Nasdaq firms from June 1988 to December 1994, we find that firms with a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> experience negative and significant abnormal returns when they are heavily shorted. Using a calendar-time portfolio approach, we regress monthly portfolio excess returns of stocks that had at least 2. 5 percent short <b>interest</b> ~number <b>of</b> shares sold short as a percentage of the shares outstanding! in the previous month on the three Fama and French ~ 1993 ! risk factors and a fourth momentum factor ~Carhart ~ 1997 !!. The regression yields negative and significant abnormal returns of � 0. 76 percent per month during our sample period. The magnitude of the negative abnormal returns increases with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest.</b> These results indicate that a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> short <b>interest</b> is a bearish signal...|$|R
30|$|Large {{enterprises}} (LEs) show higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{and engagement}} in IoT application development than SMEs. The limited financial {{and human resources}} of SMEs, which hinder R&D activities, might explain this result (Hausman 2005; Massa and Testa 2008; Laperche and Liu 2013). SMEs focus strongly on customers (Scozzi et al. 2005). In combination with the difficulty of predicting demand for and revenues of potential customer-oriented IoT applications, the strong focus of SMEs on customers {{does not have a}} positive impact on their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and engagement. However, SMEs are more flexible and can adapt quickly to changes in technologies or markets (Scozzi et al. 2005).

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E
