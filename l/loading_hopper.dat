5000|$|By using a huge, hydraulic-powered {{rotating}} rake {{with large}} steel tines, refuse was scooped {{up from the}} <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> and forced {{through a set of}} stationary tines. The continuous rotation of the rake progressively mangled, mutilated and compacted the refuse so as to reduce the space required to dump it at the landfill site.|$|E
50|$|Semi-{{automated}} side loaders use {{an automated}} mechanism to lift and dump manually aligned waste containers inside {{the main body}} of the truck. The primary difference of semi-automated side loaders is that they require more than one person, to operate the truck, and to manually bring and align containers to the <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> on the side of the truck.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{rear loader}} usually {{compacts}} the waste using a hydraulically powered mechanism that employs a moving plate or shovel to scoop the waste {{out from the}} <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> and compress it against a moving wall. In most compactor designs, the plate has a pointed edge (hence giving it the industry standard name packer blade) {{which is designed to}} apply point pressure to the waste to break down bulky items in the hopper before being drawn into {{the main body of the}} truck.|$|E
5000|$|Bulk {{material}} handling. Belt feeders {{are typically}} used for handling fairly light, fine, abrasive, free flowing materials. Feeder units are typically placed under storage facilities such as silos, surge <b>hoppers</b> or <b>load</b> <b>hoppers,</b> {{and may be}} operated either horizontally or on an incline to save headroom. For such applications, belt width is governed {{by the size of}} the material being handled and required tons per hour.|$|R
50|$|Utica Station was a Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad {{station in}} North Utica, Illinois (also known as Utica). The station is about 90 {{miles west of}} Chicago and is {{on one of the}} few double tracked parts of the CSX New Rock Subdivision (Joliet—Bureau). It is also just west of a grain {{elevator}} and a small yard to <b>load</b> <b>hopper</b> cars. The building was heavily damaged by an April 20, 2004 tornado, that killed 8 in Utica. Because of that damage, it was eventually razed.|$|R
50|$|Each caboose-working cycle {{began with}} the picking up {{of a string of}} 34 empty hopper wagons and a guard’s van in Bloemfontein. These were worked through to Postmasburg, with the engines recoaling at Kamfersdam outside Kimberley. At Postmasburg they picked up 34 <b>loaded</b> <b>hopper</b> wagons and a guard’s van, an {{approximate}} load of 2,700 tons, and worked all the way through to Kroonstad, where the loads were re-marshalled into 1,500 ton bites for the 1 in 66 (1½%) grades east of there to Harrismith. At Kroonstad the <b>loaded</b> <b>hoppers</b> were exchanged for empties and the whole cycle repeated. Recoaling points were at Postmasburg, Kamfersdam, Hamilton and Kroonstad and en route rewatering points were at Kloofeind and Glen. It took roughly two days to complete a loaded-empty cycle over the full route and an average of ten cycles were managed on each three-week tour of duty. Caboose-working was always with pairs of Class 23 locomotives, until the Class 25 condensers took over the section from Postmasburg to Kamfers Dam c. 1962 and the practice was discontinued. After electrification of the Postmasburg branch late in 1966, steam only came on at Beaconsfield and crews and engines were once more being changed in the traditional manner at Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and Bethlehem.|$|R
5000|$|Compactor designs, however, {{have been}} many and varied, however the two most popular in use today are the [...] "sweep and slide" [...] system (first pioneered on the Leach 2R Packmaster), where the packer blade pivots on a moving {{carriage}} which slides back and forth, and the [...] "swing link" [...] system (such as the Dempster Routechief) where the blade literally swings on a [...] "pendulum"-style mechanism. The Heil Colectomatic used {{a combination of a}} lifting <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> and a pivoting sweeper blade to clear and compact waste in anticipation of the next load.|$|E
50|$|The Rotopress is a {{continuously}} compacting garbage truck. A massive {{rotating drum}} compacts and stores the garbage. The {{outer edge of}} the drum acts as the <b>loading</b> <b>hopper,</b> and paddles on the drum convey the waste around an auger of decreasing pitch until it is small enough to be forced through a small ring-shaped gap between the drum and the auger, where it then enters the main section of the drum, which has helically shaped internal paddles which move the now-crushed waste towards the front of the vehicle. When emptying the drum, the direction of rotation is reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Lift-equipped {{trucks are}} {{referred}} to as automated side loaders, or ASL's. Similar to a front-end loader, the waste is compacted by an oscillating packer plate {{at the front of the}} <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> which forces the waste through an aperture into the main body and is therefore compacted towards the rear of the truck. [...] An Automated Side Loader only needs one operator, where a traditional rear load garbage truck may require two or three people, and has the additional advantage of reducing on the job injuries due to repetitive heavy lifting. Due to these advantages, ASL's have become more popular than traditional manual collection. Typically an Automated Side Loader uses standardized wheeled carts compatible with the truck's automated lift.|$|E

50|$|Each {{hopper car}} had wheels that were {{equipped}} with an ordinary air brake. The air brakes consist of a metal shoe that presses against the flange of the wheels when the air brakes are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more efficiently the friction can convert to traction instead of heat. The faster a wheel moves, the more efficiently friction converts the other way around. Thus, air brakes work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 mph as this is {{the speed at which}} traction is gained more than heat via the input of friction. The effectiveness of the air brakes on MJLBP-11's fully <b>loaded</b> <b>hopper</b> cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) would have had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased.|$|R
40|$|A dust-removing {{loosening}} {{machine has}} been developed, made and {{tested in the}} working conditions; it has successfully {{been used in the}} pile-sliver flow line for preparing a semi-finished item at spinning medium- and high-line density yarn.

30|$|The {{pharmacy}} within Hospital A {{has been}} operating an integrated electronic prescribing system for over 10  years (a Meditech system obtained from the USA). This system has modules for pharmacy, pathology, radiology, patient entry, electronic prescribing and medicine recording, and is the main recording system of the hospital. The pharmacy at Hospital A installed a robotic dispensing machine in 2009. The machine chosen was a triple-headed ROWA machine, with an automated labeller for each picking head. This machine stores products chaotically within itself, using product bar codes. A <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> and automatic loader for the machine was also purchased, which is around 10 metres long. The business case for the machine anticipated efficiencies, and it was estimated four whole time equivalent (WTE) technical staff would be released for re-deployment into {{other areas of the}} hospital. The pharmacy is open 80  hours a week and the staff savings were estimated across this time frame. Medication safety was also a feature of the business case. One crucial element of the project was the writing of the interface software that linked the unique product code in the Meditech electronic prescribing system to the ROWA robotic product system. The links had to be exclusive for each individual product, and it is this linkage between electronic prescribing and the robot, that yields the benefits. Within the business case, a smaller case for a second robot in the separate out–patient department was included. The service and software costs had already been considered for the main pharmacy robot, so the only additional cost was that of a single headed ROWA machine. This meant the business case for the out-patients pharmacy was smaller in anticipated efficiencies. The impact of linking technology on dispensing errors, staff efficiencies, and other efficiencies were assessed.|$|E

40|$|Track {{quality is}} a major factor in {{railroad}} safety, and one accepted indicator of track quality is the vertical track deflection. Measuring track deflection from a moving railcar is difficult because there is no stable reference for the measurements. ^ A system developed by researchers at the University of Nebraska to measure track deflection from a moving railcar in real-time is described in detail. The system consists of a <b>loaded</b> <b>hopper</b> with a camera/laser sensor system to detect the vertical deflection of the rail relative to the wheel/rail contact point. Modeling and simulation of the system is also presented along with the mathematical models which can be used to estimate track modulus. ^ The measurement system has been used to conduct revenue service tests over three thousand miles of track.

These results include a trending study conducted {{over the past year}} where four tests of the same track were conducted at roughly 3 month intervals. The trending results can be used to quantify how track modulus (relative vertical deflection) degrades with tonnage at the approaches to bridges. A mathematical method is presented to use the trending data to predict future performance of specific sections of track. It is suggested that such measurements are useful in prioritizing maintenance and in derailment prevention. The results in this paper are preliminary and more measurements are clearly needed over longer periods of time...|$|R

50|$|Although, {{in later}} years, the colliers faced {{competition}} from the railways in supplying coal for domestic use in the capital, large quantities of coal were used at the numerous power stations {{on the banks of}} the River Thames, and wharves were constructed alongside them for unloading the colliers.
