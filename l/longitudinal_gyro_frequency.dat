Above about one-quarter of the local electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency</b> the waves occur most frequently for strong magnetic fields and much less frequently for weak fields. However, below about one-quarter of the electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency,</b> the occurrence rate is much less sensitive to field strength.

The occurrence rate is strongly dependent on local time especially above the electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency.</b> Here, the occurrence rate peaks sharply at 2100 LT. Below the local electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency</b> the occurrence rate also shows a maximum near 2100 LT but decreases much more slowly with increasing local time.

Using ray tracing {{to map the}} waves to higher latitudes, we show that the decrease in the ratio between the electron plasma and <b>gyro</b> <b>frequencies,</b> along with the normalized chorus frequency bandwidth, enable much higher energy electrons ∼ 1 MeV to be scattered into the loss cone.

Downstream from Io (but not upstream) strong ion cyclotron waves were seen. The very low frequency of these waves, well below the local SO+ 2 <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency,</b> suggests that they were created in the low 9 eld of Io’s wake. Thus in contrast to implications of the December 1995, near-Io, wake passage, ion cyclotron waves are produced in the Io wake.

The electron inertial length is an intrinsic length scale in whistler wave turbulence that distinguishably divides the high frequency solar wind turbulent spectra into scales smaller and bigger than the electron inertial length. We present nonlinear three dimensional, time dependent, fluid simulations of whistler wave turbulence to investigate their role in solar wind plasma. Our simulations find that the dispersive whistler modes evolve entirely differently in the two regimes. While the dispersive whistler wave effects are stronger in the large scale regime, they do not influence the spectral cascades which are describable by a Kolmogorov-like $k^{- 7 / 3 }$ spectrum. By contrast, the small scale turbulent fluctuations exhibit a Navier-Stokes like evolution where characteristic turbulent eddies exhibit a typical $k^{- 5 / 3 }$ hydrodynamic turbulent spectrum.

Incoherent scatter radar (ISR) plasma-line amplitudes are used as a measure of suprathermal electron ﬂuxes for ISR wavelengths near those for 430 MHz and are indeed a clean measure of such for those ﬂuxes sufficiently weak to have negligible self-damping. We present data from an HF heating experiment on November 2015 at Arecibo,which even more directly conﬁrm the only prior midlatitude estimate, of order 10 % efficiently for conversion of HF energy to ionospheric ionization.

In this paper we re-examine these modes using a relativistic formulation for the hot electrons which we also treat as highly anisotropic by neglecting their parallel momenta relative to the perpendicular momenta and their rest mass energy. We find a significant enhancement in the ion beta value as a result of treating the ring electrons relativistically. For typical present day EBT parameters we find that the value of the ion beta increases by about 50 % as a result of increasing the hot electron mean energy from about several keV to few MeV.

Due to their importance, there is an interest in accurately measuring and modeling the electric fields for both climatological and near real-time studies. In this work, we present the daytime vertical (Ez) and eastward (Ey) electric fields for a reference quiet day (February 7, 2001) at the São Luís Space Observatory, Brazil (SLZ, 2.31 °S, 44.16 °W). The component Ez is inferred from Doppler shifts of type II echoes (gradient drift instability) and the anisotropic factor, which is computed from ion and electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequencies</b> as well as ion and electron collision frequencies with neutral molecules. The component Ey depends on the ratio of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and Ez. A magnetic field-line-integrated conductivity model is used to obtain the anisotropic factor for calculating Ez and the ionospheric conductivities for calculating Ey. This model uses the NRLMSISE- 00, IRI- 2007, and IGRF- 11 empirical models as input parameters for neutral atmosphere, ionosphere, and geomagnetic field, respectively. Consequently, it is worth determining the uncertainties (or errors) in Ey and Ez associated with these empirical model outputs in order to precisely define the confidence limit for the estimated electric field components. For this purpose, errors of ± 10  % were artificially introduced in the magnitude of each empirical model output before estimating Ey and Ez. The corresponding uncertainties in the ionospheric conductivity and electric field are evaluated considering the individual and cumulative contribution of the artificial errors. The results show that the neutral densities and temperature may be responsible for the largest changes in Ey and Ez, followed by changes in the geomagnetic field intensity and electron and ions compositions.|$|R

The experiment {{was carried out in}} the evening hours when the electron density in the F-region dropped, and the HF pump frequency fH was near and then above the critical frequency of the F 2 layer. The distinctive feature of this experiment is that the pump frequency was just below the third electron <b>gyro</b> harmonic <b>frequency,</b> while both the HF pump beam and UHF radar beam were directed towards the magnetic zenith (MZ). The HF pump-induced phenomena were diagnosed with several instruments: the bi-static HF radio scatter on the London- Tromsø-St. Petersburg path, the CUTLASS radar in Hankasalmi (Finland), the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at Tromsø and the Tromsø ionosonde (dynasonde). The results show thermal electron excitation of the HF-induced striations seen simultaneously from HF bi-static scatter and CUTLASS radar observations, accompanied by increases of electron temperature when the heater frequency was near and then above the critical frequency of the F 2 layer by up to 0. 4 MHz. An increase of the electron density up to 25 % accompanied by strong HF-induced electron heating was observed, only when the heater frequency was near the critical frequency and just below the third electron <b>gyro</b> harmonic <b>frequency.</b> It is concluded that the combined effect of upper hybrid resonance and gyro resonance at the same altitude gives rise to strong electron heating, the excitation ofstriations, HF ray trapping and extension of HF waves to altitudes where they can excite Langmuir turbulence and fluxes of electrons accelerated to energies that produce ionization...|$|R
