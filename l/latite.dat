40|$|Abstract A {{systematic}} petrological {{and chemical}} {{study of the}} volcanic products of the Phlegraean Fields has been accomplished based on the new stratigraphy described by Rosi et al. (this volume). The majority of Phlegraean rocks belong to the "potassic" series of the Roman province. The compositional spectrum ranges from trachybasalts to <b>latites,</b> trachytes, alkali trachytes, and peralkaline phonolitic trachytes. Trachybasalts are extremely rare {{and there is a}} sharp compositional gap between them and the <b>latites.</b> The series between <b>latites</b> and the trachytic varieties is complete. Trachytic rocks are much more voluminous than <b>latites.</b> The order of appearance of the main solid phases is: olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, alkali feldspar, biotite, and oxides. Mineral compositions obtained by microprobe analyases are compatible with the evolution of the rock chemistry. However, primitive compositions of plagioclase (An 80) and clinopyroxene (diopside) persist in the cores of phenocrysts, even at the trachytic and alkali trachytic stage. Fractional crystallization within a shallow magma chamber has been the dominant process for the generation of Phlegraean rock series. The volume of the magma chamber is estimated to have been at least 240 km 3 at the moment of the eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite, nearly 35, 000 yr. ago. This event was followed by a large caldera collapse. The depth of the chamber cannot be precisely evaluated. However, its top must have been very shallow, probably at 4 - 5 km, as suggested by contact metamorphic rocks obtained from deep geothermal wells within the caldera. Volcanological and petrological data favor a model of upward migration of lighter liquids produced mostly by fractionation along the cool walls of the chamber, the deeper part of which is occupied by a convecting trachybasaltic magma. Progressive migration of eruptive vents toward the caldera center and the contemporaneous strong reduction in the volume of the erupted products, suggest that the chamber behaved as a closed system. The volume of magma was progressively reduced by both cooling and extraction to the surface. © 1983...|$|R
40|$|Widespread Tertiary {{magmatism}} of both orogenic and within-plate signatures developed {{within the}} Macedonian {{part of the}} Dinarides. Orogenic magmatites (predominantly volcanic rocks) are present in 5 areas (from east to west) : Osogovo-Besna Kobila, Kratovo-Zletovo, Bucim-Borov Dol, Dojran and Kozuf. The age of the igneous rocks decreases in the same direction: from Priabonian-Early Oligocene at Os ogovo-Besna Kobila area, Early Oligocene-Miocene in Kratovo-Zletovo and Bucim-Borov Dol to Late Miocene-Late Pliocene in Kozuf. The Osogovo-Besna Kobila area contains only acid volcanics (trachydacites to dacites), occurring mainly as subvolcanic to hypabyssal bodies. They have collision-related chemical characteristics. <b>Latites</b> and andesites to dacites predominate in the Kratovo-Zletovo area, but a monzonite pluton is also be found. Only the shoshonite series (from <b>latites</b> to trachy­ rhyolites) is present in Bucim-Borov Dol, and trachytes in Dojran area.

40|$|New whole {{rock and}} microanalytical data on mineral phases provide {{constraints}} {{for a comprehensive}} model of the Lipari-Vulcano plumbing system, at least during the last 1000 years. The eruptive activity between 1100 - 1200 AD represents an important phase of the Lipari-Vulcano volcanic complex (LVVC) for several reasons: 1) fairly contemporaneous activity at Vulcanello and Fossa vents at Vulcano island and at Rocche Rosse on Lipari island, along a common N-S alignment; 2) simultaneous eruptions at Lipari and Vulcano at 1230 ± 40 AD; 3) since this date latitic products, associated or not with rhyolitic magmas, have always been erupted with variable eruptive styles and volumes. Shoshonitic products erupted at Vulcanello {{at the end of}} XII century are the least differentiated of the last 1000 years. Whole rock, mineral phase and mineral-hosted melt inclusion data show that latitic products emitted at both islands have several geochemical affinitites. In particular, <b>latites</b> show superimposed trends of REE and incompatible elements for whole rock and all mineralogical phases. Whole rocks Sr-Nd isotopic data indicate that Vulcano and Vulcanello <b>latites</b> are intermediate between those of Lipari, with poor Sr-Nd isotope correlation. Micro-Sr isotopic data performed by microdrilling techniques (Micromill + TIMS instruments), on clinopyroxenes, plagioclases and groundmasses belonging to the Pietre Cotte lava flow (1720 AD) and 1888 - 90 products of La Fossa eruptions show small but consistent variations of Sr isotopes (0. 70458 - 0. 70492), which increase from plagioclase core to rim and then groundmass. These variations can indicate: i) mixing with more Sr-radiogenic magmas; ii) crustal contamination; iii) crystal recycling from a crystal mush related to the previous and less Sr-radiogenic activity of Vulcano. Textural observations and core-to-rim profiles on plagioclases show that dynamics of magma ascent and storage are markedly different in the Fossa and Vulcanello system of Vulcano. Transfer mechanisms are however almost unchanged in each system during the considered timespan. Petrological data suggest that the historical eruptions of Lipari and Vulcano islands could be fed by a common plumbing system at depth, hosting shoshonitic basalts to shoshonites. Shoshonites were erupted only at the end XII-early XIII century AD (e. g. early Vulcanello). Magma ascent occurred through a polibaric storage system allowing the eruption of mafic and prevalently degassed magmas (Vulcanello), but also the repeated storage and differentiation to <b>latites</b> and rhyolites at intermediate and very shallow depth (late Vulcanello, La Fossa and Rocche Rosse at Lipari). Differentiation models suggest that <b>latites</b> can be obtained by AFC process starting from the shoshonite. <b>Latites</b> are the prevalent magmas erupted in historical times and are always involved in the rhyolitic eruptions, indicating the recurrent occurrence of mingling following refilling events...|$|R

The remaining NW Etendeka silicic units are enigmatic high-Ti types, geochemically different from low-Ti types. They exhibit chemical affinities with the temporally overlapping Khumib high-Ti basalt (see Ewart et al. Part 1) and high crystallization temperatures (greater than or equal to 980 to 1120 degreesC) inferred from augite and pigeonite phenocrysts, both consistent with their evolution from a mafic source. Geochemically, the high-Ti units define three groups, thought genetically related. We test whether these represent independent liquid lines of descent from a common high-Ti mafic parent. Although the recognition of <b>latites</b> reduces the apparent silica gap, difficulty is encountered in fractional crystallization models by the large volumes of two QL units. Numerical modelling does, however, support large-scale open-system fractional crystallization, assimilation of silicic to basaltic materials, and magma mixing, but cannot entirely exclude partial melting processes within the temporally active extensional environment. The fractional crystallization and mixing signatures add to the complexity of these enigmatic and controversial silicic magmas. The existence, however, of temporally and spatially overlapping high-Ti basalts is, in our view, not coincidental and the high-Ti character of the silicic magmas ultimately reflects a mantle signature...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{number of}} {{minerals}} and residual glasses from absarokites, shoshonites, and <b>latites</b> have been analysed by electron probe. Clinopyroxenes show very little iron-enrichment and these rocks are thus distinguished from thoteiites and alkali basalts.

A review of world occurrences of shoshonitic rocks (Joplin, I 968) has shown that compositions may range from ultramafic absarokites to felsic toscanites and liparites and that there is little iron enrichment.

Cimini that are the most mafic magmas, belong to the last phase of this volcanic activity, and are heterogeneous in highly incompatible element ratios and Sr-isotope compositions. We suggest that such heterogeneity reflects the occurrence of a heterogeneous upper mantle beneath central Italy, in which different portions, e. g., the sources of both the TMP and RMP, are characterized by distinct geochemical and petrographic features. In this scenario, about 900 ka ago, the olivine-bearing <b>latites</b> mark the progressive decline of the TMP magma production in favour of partial melting of the RMP mantle region, thus recording the coexistence of both ultrapotassic alkaline and calc-alkaline magmas in the same volcanic region...|$|R

40|$|The {{elemental}} and isotopic compositions {{of noble}} gases (He, Ne, and Ar) in olivine- and clinopyroxene-hosted fluid inclusions have been measured for rocks at {{various degrees of}} evolution and belonging to high-K calcalkaline–shoshonitic and shoshonitic–potassic series in order to cover the entire volcanological history of Vulcano Island (Italy). The major- and trace-element concentrations and the Sr- and Pb-isotope compositions for whole rocks were integrated with data obtained from the fluid inclusions. 3 He/ 4 He in fluid inclusions is {{within the range of}} 3. 30 and 5. 94 R/Ra, being lower than the theoretical value for the deep magmatic source expected for Vulcano Island (6. 0 – 6. 2 R/Ra). 3 He/ 4 He of the magmatic source is almost constant throughout the volcanic history of Vulcano. Integration of the He- and Sr-isotope systematics leads to the conclusion that a decrease in the He-isotope ratio of the rocks is mainly due to the assimilation of 10 – 25 % of a crustal component similar to the Calabrian basement. 3 He/ 4 He shows a negative correlation with Sr isotopes except for the last-erupted Vulcanello <b>latites</b> (Punta del Roveto), which have anomalously high He isotope ratios. This anomaly has been attributed to a flushing process by fluids coming from the deepest reservoirs, since an input of deep magmatic volatiles with high 3 He/ 4 He values increases the He-isotope ratio without changing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. A comparison of the He-isotope ratios between fluid inclusions and fumarolic gases shows that only the basalts of La Sommata and the <b>latites</b> of Vulcanello have comparable values. Taking into account that the <b>latites</b> of Vulcanello relate to one of the most-recent eruptions at Vulcano (in the 17 th century), we infer that the most probable magma which actually feeds the fumarolic emissions is a latitic body that ponded at about 3 – 3. 5 km of depth and is flushed by fluids coming from a deeper and basic magma...|$|R
