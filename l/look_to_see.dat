500|$|I'm {{not ashamed}} of making {{mistakes}}. I've made a million mistakes and they're all in the diary. When we edit the diary – which is cut to around 10 percent – every mistake has to be printed because people <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if you do. I would be ashamed if I thought I'd ever said anything I didn't believe to get on, but making mistakes is part of life, isn't it? ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability cooldowns, but {{spoke of a}} disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between the screen and the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, had nothing but praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game". He {{went on to say that}} players will <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the technology spread to other miniature wargaming products.|$|E
2500|$|Siddons {{occasionally}} gave public {{readings of}} plays, and the Scottish poet/playwright Joanna Baillie recorded her thoughts of several performances given in 1813. Despite her reservations about Siddon's [...] "frequent bursts of voice beyond what natural passion warranted," [...] Baillie wrote to Sir Walter Scott, [...] "take {{it all in}} all was fine & powerful acting; and when it has ceased we of this generation can never <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the like again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Turing {{makes no}} comment about how machine D goes about its work. For sake of argument, we suppose that D would first <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if {{the string of}} symbols is [...] "well-formed" [...] (i.e. {{in the form of}} an {{algorithm}} and not just a scramble of symbols), and if not then discard it. Then it would go “circle-hunting”. To do this perhaps it would use “heuristics” (tricks: taught or learned). For purposes of the proof, these details are not important.|$|E
2500|$|In some appeals from {{decisions}} of administrative agencies, the courts apply a [...] "substantial evidence" [...] {{standard of review}} of the agency's factual findings. In the United States, for example, if a Social Security Disability Insurance claimant is found [...] "not disabled" [...] (and, therefore, ineligible for benefits) by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the claimant appeals, both the Appeals Council (the body within the Social Security Administration that hears appeals from {{decisions of}} ALJs) and the Federal courts (which, {{in this type of}} case, will normally hear an appeal only after the claimant has exhausted all administrative remedies) will <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether the administrative law judge's decision was supported by [...] "substantial evidence" [...] or not. Substantial evidence is [...] "more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." ...|$|E
