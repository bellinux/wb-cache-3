40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} some of the major ethical issues {{involved}} when employing disability simulations as a teaching tool in college-level courses on individuals with disabilities. These issues include: (a) the importance of maximizing the authenticity of the simulation experience; (b) the need to confront situations in which the simulation experience leads to increased discouragement {{on the part of some}} student participants; (c) the necessity for faculty members to recognize and fulfill various obligations to students, to the host institution, and to the larger community if disability simulations are conducted as required course exercises; and (d) the need to convince students of the relevance of disability simulations to their own lives, and to the larger society. The substance of the paper is derived mainly from personal reflections of the author regarding his experiences in conducting disability simulation exercises in college-level courses dealing with people with disabilities and disability-related issues. As a college professor, a sociologist, and a <b>legally</b> totally <b>blind</b> individual, I have found the idea of disability simulations to be inherently interesting.

A total of 4, 029 children, which included 2, 348 males and 1, 681 females, in the age range of 3 to 18 years from 9 schools were screened with a detailed ocular examination protocol. Among 3, 669 children in whom visual acuity could be recorded, on presentation 115 (3. 1 &#x 0025;) had visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 18 in the better eye (equivalent to visual impairment), while 41 (1. 1 &#x 0025;) had visual acuity of 6 / 60 in the better eye (equivalent to legal blindness) out of which 18 (0. 5 &#x 0025;) had visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 60 in the better eye (equivalent to economic blindness). Of 115 children who presented with initial visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 18, vision improved to &#x 0026;# 8805; 6 / 18 with refraction in 109 (94. 8 &#x 0025;).

The prevalence of myopia was significantly higher among children &#x 0026;# 8805; 10 years of age (P&#x 0026;lt; 0. 001). The maximum, mean and median values for myopia were 10. 00, 1. 35 and 0. 75 D in the better eye. For hyperopia these values were 8. 50, 0. 65 and 0. 50 D.

40|$|Sacred crimes: a {{psychological}} approach Grattagliano Ignazio, Cassibba Rosalinda, Mininni Giuseppe & Scardigno Rosa Department of educational sciences, psychology and communication University of Bari Aldo Moro Religions are constructed as systems of meanings (Park, 2005) {{and act as}} systems of communication (Pace, 2008) : they offer to believers a set of beliefs, goals, a subjective sense of meaning, that are discursively and narratively constructed, socialized and acted. By offering stories and shared meanings, religions contribute to give order to social reality and propose to their interlocutors a kind of communicative contract (Mininni, Ghiglione, 1995) : if and how the addressees accept this proposal open {{a wide range of}} positioning (Scardigno, 2010). On the extreme positions, the atheists refuse the contract, whereas the magic-idolizing positioning accept {{as long as they can}} see/touch the Transcendent. In the middle of this continuum, the interlocutors can become active intralocutors and construct their own religiosity. Most of time, this relation can be mediated by several kinds of vicarious figures: those who consider themselves as receiving viva-voce the divine Word; those who act rituals as empowered by a religious institution; those who can introduce the believer in an “other” dimension. These figures respectively refer to three kinds of charisma: personal, functional and specific charisma (Pace, 2008). Most of time, believers can meet religious figures having one kind of charisma; sometimes two of them can be met; in extraordinary cases, the three charismas join. These figures’ features really offer believers the possibility to construct a relation with a figure they can trust in, sometimes with a reverential attitude. Unfortunately, sometimes these religious men can take advantage of their positions: the words and the rituals that should offer meanings, values, comfort and hope, can become weapons and dangerous communicative tools for believers in good faith. In this background, the present work is focused on a case study: the subject is a 53 -year-old man who is <b>legally</b> declared as <b>blind,</b> and who has various previous convictions for fraud and sexual abuse on minors. He would convince people that he was a Catholic clergyman and organized masses and personal appearances in which messages from God would supposedly come through him. In addition to overseeing two religious centers where he would gather groups of the “faithful” who believed in his visions, he would also make visits to people’s homes in order to pray and perform religious rites, as well as to offer his assistance in order to help them with their various problems. The case of this “bogus priest” came to our attention following new allegations of sexually abusing five juvenile males, four of them belonging to one family (ages 10, 13, 14, and 17), and the other, their 14 year old cousin. The minors belonged to families with a multitude of problems resulting from economic hardship and relational difficulties. Judicial investigations carried out revealed that the boys had been the objects of sexual abuse at his hands over a period of time. It came out that these episodes had occurred during prayer, at confession, and when receiving spiritual guidance. Content analysis and discourse analysis on the victims’ answers to the questionings revealed stories of a well-planned strategy by the “bogus priest” abuser: the trust is betrayed and the young boys declare the oppositions between the “paternal” attitude, during the day-light, and the “strange” behaviors, during the night-time. This case study offers the possibility to reflect that the sense of order proposed by a religious system of meanings can be overthrown: psychology of religion, psychopathology and law can find a common field for investigation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It seems paradoxical, but {{the more}} {{rational}} a society becomes, the more its need for spirituality grows. The phenomenon of magical religiosity is not associated with any particular social class, but {{may be found in}} all social strata of the population: People often turn in this direction at times when they are unable to face negative life events. Unscrupulous criminals, who take advantage of such weaknesses and problems of others, exploit these characteristics of fragility. The case presented here demonstrates this concept. The Case: The subject is a 53 -year-old man who is <b>legally</b> declared as <b>blind,</b> and who has various previous convictions for fraud and sexual abuse on minors. He would convince people that he was a Catholic clergyman and organized masses and personal appearances in which messages from God would supposedly come through him. In addition to overseeing two religious centers where he would gather groups of the “faithful” who believed in his visions, he would also make visits to people’s homes in order to pray and perform religious rites, as well as to offer his assistance in order to help them with their various problems. The case of this “bogus priest” came to our attention following new allegations of sexually abusing five juvenile males, four of them belonging to one family (ages 10, 13, 14, and 17), and the other, their 14 year old cousin. The minors belonged to families with a multitude of problems resulting from economic hardship and relational difficulties. They had come to know the “bogus priest” during prayer meetings. When the imposter had learned of the two families’ problems, he began to make “pastoral visits” where he would offer to host the boys in his sanctuary homes during school breaks and the summer holidays. He eventually requested that custody of the boys be given over to him. He reported the families’ difficulties to social services in a manipulative way. He also stated that the boys had been sexually abused and neglected, but some of the investigations into this alleged abuse had brought his true identity to light. Judicial investigations carried out revealed that the boys had been the objects of sexual abuse at his hands over a period of time. It came out that these episodes had occurred during prayer, at confession, and when receiving spiritual guidance. The victims recounted stories of a well-planned strategy by the “bogus priest” abuser. In addition to isolating them from their families and their home environments, the “bogus priest” touched them on their genitals, asked them to perform sexual acts on each other, tried to engage in oral sex with them, masturbated them, showed them pornographic films, and asked them very intimate questions during “phony confessions”. The fake clergyman also gave the boys money in order that they not reveal what had happened. Moreover, he threatened them, saying that if they divulged what had transpired, they would be institutionalized and would lose all contact with their families. In order to prevent the parents from speaking to each other, or with social service representatives, he spoke badly to each one about the others, thereby creating a situation of isolation and conflict within the families. After being exposed, the “bogus priest” was arrested and found guilty. Conclusions: The literature, as well as clinical and rehabilitation experience on juvenile victims of sexual abuse, all demonstrate that the psychological damage to developmental processes on minors is much more severe when the abuser is a significant figure who is emotionally tied to the victim, particularly mothers and fathers. For this reason, intrafamilial sexual abuse is particularly serious and harmful to a child. We can hypothesize that a priest is perceived as a father insomuch as children have fewer instruments to separate the concept of God the father from a concrete figure who represents him. It is probable, therefore, that abuse by a priest would result in wounds just as deep as those caused by a family member. In this case however, the damage is double, because the perpetrator in question was not even a real priest. For {{a long period of time}} he presented himself as genuine to the children. For this reason we can conclude that beyond the psychic damage caused, the associated feelings of confusion and betrayal are amplified...|$|R
