5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a <b>low-voltage</b> EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} <b>low-voltage</b> neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 <b>low-voltage</b> tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in <b>low-voltage</b> networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-voltage</b> {{power circuit}} {{breakers}} can be mounted in multi-tiers in <b>low-voltage</b> switchboards or switchgear cabinets.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{continues}} to dominate <b>low-voltage</b> lines in mines and underwater applications, {{as well as}} in electric railroads, hoists, and other outdoor services.|$|E
25|$|An {{especially}} common {{application for}} <b>low-voltage</b> tantalum capacitors is power supply filtering on computer motherboards and in peripherals, {{due to their}} small size and long-term reliability.|$|E

25|$|On October 1, 2010, Tesla {{issued a}} second product safety recall in the US {{affecting}} 439 Roadsters. The recall involved the 12V <b>low-voltage</b> auxiliary cable from a redundant back-up system. The recall followed an incident where the low voltage auxiliary cable {{in a vehicle}} chafed {{against the edge of}} a carbon fiber panel, causing a short smoke and a possible fire behind the right front headlamp. This issue was limited to the 12V <b>low-voltage</b> auxiliary cable and did not involve the main battery pack or main power system.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>low-voltage</b> circuit breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 947. These circuit breakers are often installed in draw-out enclosures that allow removal and interchange without dismantling the switchgear.|$|E
25|$|Large <b>low-voltage</b> {{molded case}} and power circuit {{breakers}} may have electric motor operators {{so they can}} open and close under remote control. These may form part of an automatic transfer switch system for standby power.|$|E
25|$|The term stabistor {{refers to}} a special type of diodes {{featuring}} extremely stable forward voltage characteristics. These devices are specially designed for <b>low-voltage</b> stabilization applications requiring a guaranteed voltage over a wide current range and highly stable over temperature.|$|E
25|$|The CPU in the first-generation MacBook Air was {{a custom}} Intel Core 2 Duo Merom that was 40% {{of the size}} of the {{standard}} chip package. For models of late 2008, the CPU was replaced with a <b>low-voltage</b> Penryn chip with 6MB of cache, running on a 1066MHz bus.|$|E
25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively <b>low-voltage</b> DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury arc rectifiers and then by semiconductor rectifiers.|$|E
25|$|An alternative, which {{provides}} good quality sound without inductors (which {{are prone to}} parasitic coupling, are expensive, and may have significant internal resistance) is to employ bi-amplification with active RC filters or active digital filters with separate power amplifiers for each loudspeaker. Such low-current and <b>low-voltage</b> line level crossovers are called active crossovers.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or <b>low-voltage</b> mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. <b>Low-voltage</b> SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|Today, some {{locomotives}} in {{this system}} use a transformer and rectifier to provide <b>low-voltage</b> pulsating direct current to motors. Speed is controlled by switching winding taps on the transformer. More sophisticated locomotives use thyristor or IGBT circuitry to generate chopped or even variable-frequency alternating current (AC) that is then supplied to the AC induction traction motors.|$|E
25|$|The REM {{phase is}} also known as {{paradoxical}} sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep because of physiological similarities to waking states, including rapid, <b>low-voltage</b> desynchronized brain waves. Electrical and chemical activity regulating this phase seems to originate in the brain stem and is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of monoamine neurotransmitters histamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|The jockstrap {{was also}} {{influential}} in early 20th-century medicine with {{the invention of}} the Heidelberg Electric Belt, a <b>low-voltage</b> electric powered jockstrap that claimed to cure kidney disorders, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, and other ailments. Today, jockstraps are still worn mostly by adolescent and adult men for sports, weightlifting, medical purposes and for recovery from injury or surgery for such conditions as hematocele, groin hernia, hydrocele, or spermatocele.|$|E
25|$|A {{burglar alarm}} {{contains}} sensors which {{are connected to}} a control unit via a <b>low-voltage</b> hardwire or narrowband RF signal {{which is used to}} interact with a response device. The alarm was patented (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853, by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts. As the first person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.|$|E
25|$|Xenon short-arc lamps have a {{negative}} temperature coefficient like other gas discharge lamps. They are operated at <b>low-voltage,</b> high-current, DC and started with a high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, <b>low-voltage</b> fuses to 1kV AC rating {{are made}} in {{accordance}} with Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 248 or the harmonized Canadian Standards Association standard C22.2 No. 248. This standard applies to fuses rated 1kV or less, AC or DC, and with breaking capacity up to 200kA. These fuses are intended for installations following Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (CEC), or the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70 (NEC).|$|E
25|$|The International Electrotechnical Commission publishes {{standard}} 60269 for <b>low-voltage</b> power fuses. The {{standard is}} in four volumes, which describe general requirements, fuses for industrial and commercial applications, fuses for residential applications, and fuses to protect semiconductor devices. The IEC standard unifies several national standards, thereby improving the interchangeability of fuses in international trade. All fuses of different technologies tested to meet IEC standards will have similar time-current characteristics, which simplifies design and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Halogen lamps are {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} lamp with improved efficiency over regular {{incandescent lamp}}s. Though not as energy efficient as other alternatives, they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life. Depending on size, voltage, and designed life, small <b>low-voltage</b> halogen lamps can have 70% higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps. The high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-voltage</b> circuit {{breakers}} are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous—unlike an AC arc, {{which tends to}} go out on each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small {{circuit breakers}} are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a breaker panel.|$|E
25|$|The burden {{voltage can be}} {{significant}} in very <b>low-voltage</b> circuit areas. To check for its effect on accuracy and on external circuit operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading {{should be the same}} and circuit operation should not be affected if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the <b>low-voltage</b> high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|E
25|$|Some of Widlar's designs {{mentioned}} by Swanson and Hodgson, like the LM12 power amplifier and the LM10 ultra-low-voltage amplifier introduced in 1978, remain in {{production in the}} 21st century. LM10 is capable of operating with a 1.1 volt power supply, thus instead of a conventional bandgap reference it employs Widlar's sub-bandgap circuit locked at 200 mV and the <b>low-voltage</b> Widlar output stage. For 10 years, {{no one else in}} the industry was able to produce a circuit that matched the LM10.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to artifacts {{generated by the}} body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops, spikes originating from a momentary change in the impedance of a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency. A third source of possible interference can be {{the presence of an}} IV drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, <b>low-voltage</b> bursts, which may be confused for spikes.|$|E
25|$|A {{year before}} the flight, Aaron had been observing a test at Kennedy Space Center when he had noticed some unusual {{telemetry}} readings. On his own initiative, he traced this anomaly back to the obscure Signal Conditioning Electronics (SCE) system, {{and became one of}} the few flight controllers who was familiar with the system and its operations. For the case that first drew his attention to the system, normal readings could be restored by putting the SCE on its auxiliary setting, which meant that it would operate even with <b>low-voltage</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in <b>low-voltage</b> applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.|$|E
25|$|All {{but very}} old games use low DC {{voltages}} {{to power the}} solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used <b>low-voltage</b> AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.|$|E
25|$|The power {{consumption}} {{of these new}} processors is extremely low—average use energy consumption {{is to be in}} the 1–2 watt range in ultra low voltage variants, with thermal design powers (TDPs) of 65 watts for Conroe and most Woodcrests, 80 watts for the 3.0GHz Woodcrest, and 40 watts for the <b>low-voltage</b> Woodcrest. In comparison, an AMD Opteron 875HE processor consumes 55 watts, while the energy efficient Socket AM2 line fits in the 35 watt thermal envelope (specified a different way so not directly comparable). Merom, the mobile variant, is listed at 35 watts TDP for standard versions and 5 watts TDP for Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) versions.|$|E
25|$|The {{relevant}} {{development of}} solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors began some years after William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain invented the transistor in 1947. It {{was invented by}} Bell Laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized, more reliable <b>low-voltage</b> support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor. The solution found by R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring of the Bell labs in early 1950 was based on experiences with ceramics. They ground tantalum to a powder, which they pressed into a cylindrical form and then sintered at high a temperature between 1500 and 2000°C under vacuum conditions to produce a pellet ("slug").|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{kinetic theory}} {{calculation}} {{found that the}} ball size is set by the second Townsend coefficient (the mean free path of conduction electrons) near breakdown. Wandering glow discharges are found to occur within certain industrial microwave ovens and continue to glow for several seconds after power is shut off. Arcs drawn from high-power <b>low-voltage</b> microwave generators also are found to exhibit afterglow. Powell measured their spectra, {{and found that the}} after-glow comes mostly from metastable NO ions, which are long-lived at low temperatures. It occurred in air and in nitrous oxide, which possess such metastable ions, and not in atmospheres of argon, carbon dioxide, or helium, which do not.|$|E
25|$|This uses <b>low-voltage</b> {{electricity}} to transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E
