25|$|Some mains-powered {{detectors}} are {{fitted with}} a non-rechargeable <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> for backup with a life of typically ten years, after which {{it is recommended that}} the detector be replaced. User-replaceable disposable 9-volt lithium batteries, which last at least twice as long as alkaline batteries are available.|$|E
25|$|All the {{preceding}} types have water-based electrolytes, which limits the maximum voltage per cell. The freezing of water limits low temperature performance. The <b>lithium</b> <b>battery,</b> {{which does not}} (and cannot) use water in the electrolyte, provides improved performance over other types; a rechargeable lithium ion battery {{is an essential part}} of many mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the above}} risks, {{shipping}} and carriage of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> is restricted in some situations, particularly transport of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> by air.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether larger size <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> would be commercially marketable, the performance of several D size <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> was {{compared with that of}} an equivalent alkaline manganese battery, and the relative costs of the different systems were compared. It is concluded that opportunities exist in the consumer market for the larger sizes of the low rate and moderate rate <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries,</b> and that the high rate <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> need further improvements before they can be recommended for consumer applications...|$|R

25|$|These non-rechargeable {{batteries}} {{have many}} advantages over {{other forms of}} <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> such as a high energy density, a wide operational temperature range and long storage and operational lifespans. However, their high cost and safety concerns have limited their use. The contents of the batteries are highly toxic and require special disposal procedures, additionally they may explode if shorted.|$|E
25|$|The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has {{established}} regulations regarding the carrying of {{certain types of}} batteries on airplanes because of their instability in certain situations. This action was partially inspired by a cargo bay fire on a FedEx airplane and the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6. On 16 May 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) banned shipping anything containing a <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> to an overseas address due to fires from transport of batteries. The ban was lifted on 15 November 2012.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{advances}} in aberration corrector design {{have been able}} to reduce spherical aberrations and to achieve resolution below 0.5 Ångströms (50 pm) at magnifications above 50 million times. Improved resolution allows for the imaging of lighter atoms that scatter electrons less efficiently, such as lithium atoms in <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> materials. The ability to determine the position of atoms within materials has made the HRTEM an indispensable tool for nanotechnology research and development in many fields, including heterogeneous catalysis and the development of semiconductor devices for electronics and photonics.|$|E
50|$|The United States Transportation Security Administration {{announced}} restrictions effective January 1, 2008 on <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> in {{checked and}} carry-on luggage. The rules forbid <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> not {{installed in a}} device from checked luggage and restrict them in carry-on luggage by total lithium content.|$|R
50|$|The major {{differences}} between LFP <b>batteries</b> and ordinary <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> are that LFP batteries {{do not have}} safety concerns such as overheating and explosion, that they have 4 to 5 times longer cycle lifetimes than the <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> 8 to 10 times higher discharge power.|$|R
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|R
25|$|In Canada, Ultra Energy {{operated}} out of {{the same}} hangar where Horton was re-fitting his submarine. By the mid-1970s the refit was complete, with no battery in site, and Horton dropped his support for the battery project. After obtaining some private bridge financing, they won a contract for a non-rechargeable <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> with a shelf life of 10 years for the fire detector company, Firenetics. After about a year the battery was ready and production was going to be started in Hong Kong, when, to Ultra's surprise, Firenetics filed for bankruptcy after a long lawsuit with General Electric. Ultra Energy was insolvent.|$|E
25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Wang {{released}} the slimline Alliance 750CD 80486 based PC in the United Kingdom. These machines used standard PC/AT keyboards and were entirely IBM compatible, shipping with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. The only unusual feature was that system BIOS settings and the real-time clock were maintained by four standard AA batteries {{as opposed to}} a more typical solutionsuch as a specialty battery pack or <b>lithium</b> <b>battery.</b> While originally offered with a 33MHz 80486DX, the 750CD could be upgraded to later Socket 3 processors such as the 80486DX2 through the use of third party CPU upgrade adapters or interposers. This allowed upgrading to speeds beyond 50MHz without overclocking, or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of 100MHz with overclocking, dependent on the processor used.|$|E
50|$|From January 1, 2013, much stricter {{regulations}} were introduced by IATA regarding the carriage of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> by air.

40|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> are {{increasingly}} being considered for installation as power sources in electric and hybrid vehicles, because of their high specific energy and power. To effectively size the vehicle Rechargeable Energy Storage System, {{it is very important}} to be able to mathematically model their behaviour.

This paper presents a dynamic model of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> based on experimental tests on high power Lithium-polymer models.

One of the two batteries weighs 28.5kg and is rated 29.6 V, 76 Ah, giving 2.2 kWh. [...] Battery charging is controlled by four independent systems to prevent overcharging following early lab testing.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the all-solid state batteries, most lithium batteries employ liquid electrolytes, which pose safety issues due to their flammability. [...] Many different solid electrolytes have been proposed to replace these hazardous liquid electrolytes. For most solid-state batteries, high interfacial resistance lowers the reversibility of the intercalation process, shortening the life cycle. [...] These undesirable interfacial effects are less problematic for TiS2. [...] One all-solid-state <b>lithium</b> <b>battery</b> exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg. [...] Additionally, the average capacity of the battery decreased by less than 10% over 50 cycles. Although titanium disulfide has high electrical conductivity, high energy density, and high power, its discharge voltage is relatively low compared to other lithium batteries where the cathodes have higher reduction potentials.|$|E

5000|$|Small <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are very}} {{commonly}} used in small, portable electronic devices, such as PDAs, watches, camcorders, digital cameras, thermometers, calculators, personal computer BIOS (firmware), communication equipment and remote car locks.
