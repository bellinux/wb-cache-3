50|$|Further, the Bengal-Nagpur Railway in 1890 {{started to}} build a line from Bilaspur to Katni. The Contractors for this section were Jetha Narayan of Kumbharia, who built Railway bridge over Man River, Narayan Mandan of Kumbharia, who worked between Bilaspur to Katni <b>laid</b> <b>lines</b> in Pendra Road section, Jagmal Gangji of Kumbharia between Kanta to Belsahna, Gora Nanji of Kumbharia at Bhesnala, Vishram Karman of Chandiya from Motinala to Ajninala, Nanji Dhanji of Galpadar, Manji Jeram Rathod of Madhapar between Bialspur to Katni, Bechar Hardas of Anjar built Ghutku Station, Nanji Dossa of Sinugra built bridge over Rewa River from Katni side, Ramji Madha of Kumbharia {{stationed}} at Anuppur Station, Ranchhod Virjee of Sinugra built Shahdol Station, Kanji Pachhan of Kukma near Belgad, Mepa Rajani of Kumbharia & Ruda Akahi of Kumbharia bridged Koil River. Thus, together the Mistri community completed whole Bilaspur -Umaria - Katni section. The track was first built from Bilaspur up to Birsinghpur with major stations of Pendra Road, Anuppur, Amlai, Shahdol, Khodargam and then extended to Umaria, where line from Katni was already existing. This section of Katni to Umaria of 37 miles was built in 1886 {{by some of the}} above Mistris of Kutch and was called Katni Umaria Provincial State Railway. The complete section from Bilaspur to Katni was of about 200 miles. The line was opened in 1891. The line in 1901 was connected with Murwara Junction of Great India Peninsula Railway about half a mile further up from Katni. Upon this extension, railway track from Bilaspur was connected to Etawa in United Province and as such this line came to be known also by name of Bilaspur-Etawa Provincial State Railway.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly <b>laid</b> <b>line</b> from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|R
30|$|<b>Laid</b> <b>lines</b> are {{observed}} frequently in Japanese paper. For restoration of historic document paper, the laid line intervals should be consistent between the restoration {{paper and the}} original paper for harmonized appearance. Considering this prerequisite, the perception mechanisms of the <b>laid</b> <b>lines</b> are discussed. <b>Laid</b> <b>lines</b> can be easily observed against backlight. However, there are several cases where <b>laid</b> <b>lines</b> are not visible against backlight, but are clearly visible with diffuse reflected light. With paper sheets formed on screens with short bamboo splint pitches, <b>laid</b> <b>lines</b> were observed only with diffuse reflected light. Within these sheets, there was no fiber mass distribution or surface roughness that correlated with the periodicity of the <b>laid</b> <b>lines.</b> On the other hand, paper sheets produced using long splint pitches exhibited light transmission unevenness, fiber mass unevenness, and surface roughness. Microscopic observations using two-way low-angle illumination revealed the following mechanism. In the flow sheet-forming method, fibers are oriented strongly in the cross-splint direction in the first layer while some fibers rotate and become aligned along the interspaces between the splints in the second layer during dehydration. Bidirectionally oriented fibers perpendicular to each other result in a contrasting reflectivity perceived as <b>laid</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
