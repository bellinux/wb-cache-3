40|$|A {{number of}} changes {{over the past}} few years in Russian {{legislation}} extended the range of issues that require development of highly professional management decisions in the field of forest fire management. For the analysis of such problems it is important to take into account following issues: 1. Main changes in the legal and regulatory framework in Russia. 2. The extent of use of independent sources of information (e. g. remote sensing monitoring information of the Earth). 3. The ability to use retrospective information about previous decisions (feedback). 4. Use of formalized models (specifications, guidelines and guidance materials). 5. The possibility and the need for Federal control. Considering of these above stated issues the priorities for development are: the formation of the regulatory and methodological basis of application of the Federal Reserve forces and fire-fighting equipment, the formation of guidelines and methodological documents of specific conditions and restrictions on visiting forests, development of plans for forest fire protection, as well as analysis of <b>long-term</b> <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> index forecasts in forests, depending on weather conditions in order to further improvement of their quality. In order to solve future problems associated with the formation of the methodological framework for decision making on forest fire control (not suppression) in certain areas, forecasting the development of the forest fire situation in the regions, the formation of recommendations on the distribution of fire-fighting resources, it is important to develop the feedback; I. e. collection of relevant long term information, as well as the completion of the information base. It is important to form the organizational and technical framework for the development and regular updating of the information base on the results of certain technologies with descriptions of situations and decision making, and the consequences of their implementation...|$|E

40|$|Forest <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating {{based on}} sparse {{meteorological}} stations {{is known to}} be potentially misleading when assigned to larger areas of complex topography. This case study examines several <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices based on data from two meteorological stations at different elevations during a major drought period. This drought was caused by a persistent high pressure system, inducing a pronounced temperature inversion and its associated thermal belt with much warmer, dryer conditions in intermediate elevations. Thus, a massive drying of fuels, leading to higher <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> levels, and multiple fire occurrences at mid-slope positions were contrasted by moderate <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> especially in the valleys. The ability of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices to resolve this situation was studied based on a comparison with the actual <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> as determined from expert observations, fire occurrences and fuel moisture measurements. The results revealed that, during temperature inversion, differences in daily cycles of meteorological parameters influence <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> and that these are not resolved by standard meteorological stations and <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices (calculated on a once-a-day basis).

40|$|Abstract. A {{new tool}} has been {{developed}} to help firefighters interpret outputs of a <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating system. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Pocket Card for Firefighter Safety (or Pocket Card) is a laminated, pocket sized sheet containing locally significant historical <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> information. The concept of and template for the Pocket Card were created by the National Advisory Group for <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Rating.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} ability of two forest <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices to {{estimate}} <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> and to define {{the beginning and the}} end of fire season.

The aim of this study is to assess the skill performance of both indices and identify their strengths and weaknesses. The Canadian FWI depends on temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and wind measurements, while the Finnish FFI relies on potential evaporation and precipitation. Results indicate that, in general, FWI and FFI determine a fairly similar <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> for a set of weather conditions.

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>danger</b> {{indices are}} {{descriptors}} of fire potential {{in a large}} area, and combine a few variables that affect the initiation, spread and control of forest fires. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) {{is one of the}} most widely used <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices in the world, and it is built upon instantaneous values of temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity at noon, together with 24 hourly accumulated precipitation. However, the scarcity of appropriate data has motivated the use of daily mean values as surrogates of the instantaneous ones in several studies that aimed to assess the impact of global warming on fire. In this paper we test the sensitivity of FWI values to both instantaneous and daily mean values, analyzing their effect on mean seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> (seasonal severity rating, SSR) and extreme <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions (90 th percentile, FWI 90, and FWI> 30, FOT 30), with a special focus on its influence in climate change impact studies. To this aim, we analyzed reanalysis and regional climate model (RCM) simulations, and compared the resulting instantaneous and daily mean versions both in the present climate and in a future scenario. In particular, we were interested in determining the effect of these datasets on the projected changes obtained for the mean and extreme seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions in future climate scenarios, as given by a RCM. Overall, our results warn against the use of daily mean data for the computation of present and future <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions. Daily mean data lead to systematic negative biases of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> calculations. Although the mean seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices might be corrected to compensate for this bias, <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> extremes (FWI 90 and specially FOT 30) cannot be reliably transformed to accommodate the spatial pattern and magnitude of their respective instantaneous versions, leading to inconsistent results when projected into the future. As a result, we advocate caution when using daily mean data and strongly recommend the application of the standard definition for its calculation as closely as possible. Threshold-dependent indices derived from FWI are not reliably represented by the daily mean version and thus can neither be applied for the estimation of future <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> season length and severity, nor for the estimation of future extreme events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Days of moderate (5) or high (6) HI were associated with higher median values of the McArthur Grassland <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Index (GFDI) and {{were more likely to have}} a <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating of extreme (GFDI ≥ 50). Days of very high <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> (32 ≤ GFDI < 50) occurred at all values of the HI. The fact that extreme values of GFDI are strongly associated with high HI suggests that the current <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating system based o...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices and <b>fire</b> risk have been extensively studied {{in many regions}} of the world. This work uses partial effect analysis in semiparametric logistic regression models to assess the nonlinear relationships among location, day, altitude, <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and fire ignition from 1996 to 2008 in four different climatic regions in China. The four regions are North China (NR), Northeast China (NE), Southeast China (SE), and Southwest China (SW). The three main results are as follows: First, different <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices are selected as significant variables dependent on the region. The inter-regional difference could be partially explained by difference in local weather and vegetation conditions. Second, spatial location exerts highly significant effects in all four regions. NDVI values are selected as explained variable for NR, NE, and SE on fire ignitions. On a daily scale, altitude influences fire ignition for NR, SE, and SW. Third, the robustness of the probability models used in NE, SE, and SW is better than that in NR on a daily scale. The semiparametric logistic regression model {{used in this study}} is useful for assessing the ability of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices to estimate probabilities of fire ignition on a daily scale. This study encourages further research on assessing the predictive ability of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices developed at other temporal and spatial scales in China...|$|R
