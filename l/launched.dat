40|$|Research on the <b>launch</b> of new {{products}} in the international realm is scarce. The present paper {{is the first to}} document how <b>launch</b> window (difference in months between the first worldwide <b>launch</b> and the subsequent <b>launch</b> in a specific country) and <b>launch</b> price are interrelated and how regulation influences both <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price. The research context is the global - 50 countries worldwide - <b>launch</b> of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas. We show that the fastest <b>launch</b> occurs when the <b>launch</b> price is moderately high and the highest <b>launch</b> price occurs at a <b>launch</b> window of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in that {{the extent to which it}} delays the <b>launch</b> of a new drug increases with the price of the new drug. We also find that regulation overall increases the <b>launch</b> window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly, regulation does not directly impact <b>launch</b> price. The descriptive information on average <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price and the interconnection between <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price allows managers in ethical drug companies to build more informed decisions for international market entry. This study also provides public policy analysts with more quantitative evidence regarding <b>launch</b> window and <b>launch</b> price on a broad sample of countries and categories. regulation;pharmaceutical;entry timing;launch price;launch window;international new product <b>launch...</b>|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga <b>launched</b> her airstrike, the Japanese <b>launched</b> theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku <b>launched</b> nine D3As and six Zeros.

The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
