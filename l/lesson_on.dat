40|$|Approximately 250 {{remedial}} {{lessons in}} auditory {{training for the}} elementary school child are presented for six major areas: auditory reception, auditory discrimination, auditory memory, auditory sequential memory, grammatic closure, and auditory association. The lessons are designed for the child who has adequate auditory sensitivity, but who does not respond to auditory stimuli as others do. Within each major area the activities are divided into readiness, academic, and advanced levels. The levels are intended only to provide a means of dividing the activities into sections which become progressively more difficult. The lessons are said to assume an average class length of 50 minutes. The lessons are generally arranged into sections denoting instructional objective, materials to be used, activities to achieve objective, and occasional comments. Rationale for the remedial program precedes 31 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> auditory reception, 30 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> auditory discrimination, 68 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> auditory memory, 104 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> auditory sequential memory, 17 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> grammatic closure, and 23 <b>lessons</b> <b>on</b> auditory association.
