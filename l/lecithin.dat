5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or <b>lecithin),</b> phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E

The infants fed the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better scores on the Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lecithin</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of <b>lecithin,</b> though the majority of <b>lecithin</b> commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed <b>lecithin</b> is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when <b>lecithin</b> is used at common levels. <b>Lecithin</b> added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including <b>lecithin.</b> Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like <b>lecithin</b> with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell <b>lecithin</b> in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of two purified lysolecithin-hydrolyzing enzymes on homologous series of synthetic <b>lecithins</b> containing two identical fatty acyl chains and of 1 -acyl-lysolecithins has been measured {{as a function}} of substrate concentration. In general, enzymatic activity toward <b>lecithins</b> decreased with increasing chain length. Maximal hydrolysis rates for the lysolecithin series were measured with 1 -dodecanoyllysolecithin. In this series increased affinities for substrates with increasing acyl-chain length was noticed. In the substrate concentration versus enzymatic velocity curves no breaks were observed at the critical micelle concentration of the various substrates. The initial site of attack during hydrolysis of short-chain <b>lecithins</b> was determined using 1 -octanoyl- 2 -pentanoyl-lecithin, 1 -hexanoyl- 2 -hexyllecithin and 1 -hexyl- 2 -hexanoyllecithin.

This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the action of a human pancreatic phospholipase A on various synthetic phosphatides. L-α-Phosphatidyl ethanolamines were readily hydrolysed in an aqueous system by this enzyme. Synthetic <b>lecithins,</b> however, were not attacked in an appreciable rate by the mammalian phospholipase A, contrary to {{the action of the}} enzymes from animal poisons. Addition of deoxycholate 1 or synthetic phosphatidic acid greatly enhanced the degradation of synthetic <b>lecithins</b> by the pancreatic phospholipase A. The site of action of the human pancreatic phospholipase A was determined with the aid of mixed-acid <b>lecithins</b> and phosphatidyl ethanolamines containing in different molecular positions combinations of stearic and lauric acid, stearic and oleic acid, palmitic and linolenic acid, respectively. The enzyme was demonstrated to liberate always the β-esterified fatty acids while the γ-attached fatty acid constituents were recovered in the produced lyso compounds.

25|$|In organic chemistry, some trivial names {{derive from}} a notable {{property}} of the thing being named. For instance, <b>lecithin,</b> the common name for phosphatidylcholine, was originally isolated from egg yolk. The word is coined from the Greek λέκιθος (lékithos) for yolk.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while <b>lecithin</b> and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of <b>lecithin.</b> If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E

The degree of purity of the lipids had only a slight influence on serological activity, whereas fatty acid composition, saturation, and configuration had none at all.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the structure of}} a variety of lecithin-water phases observed below the "melting" temperature of the hydrocarbon chains, with special emphasis on the conformation of the chains. The <b>lecithins</b> studied in this work are the homologous series dioctanoyl to distearoyl, 2 -decanoyl- 1 -stearoyl, and a preparation from hen eggs. The hydrocarbon chains are found to adopt a variety of conformations in additions to type α, the liquid-like organization observed above the melting temperature. Type β : the chains are stiff and parallel, oriented at right angles to the plane of the lamellae and packed with rotational disorder in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (a ~ 4. 85 Å). Type β' : similar to β, but with the chains tilted with respect to the normal to the lamellae. Type δ : the chains are probably coiled into helices, whose axes are perpendicular to the plane of the polar groups and are packed with rotational disorder in a two-dimensional square lattice (a ~ 4. 80 Å). α is the predominant conformation, common to most lipids in the presence of water and at sufficiently high temperature, and the one more relevant to membranes; δ is observed at lower temperatures in lipids whose chains are heterogeneous and in the presence of very small amounts of water; β' is found in synthetic <b>lecithins</b> with identical chains, in the presence of variable amounts of water; δ is observed in dry <b>lecithins.</b> A highly ordered crystalline phase, yet displaying rotational disorder of the chains, is observed in almost dry <b>lecithins.</b> Most of the phases are lamellar, and contain one lipid bilayer per repeat unit. Two phases display two-dimensional lattices: Pδ, formed by ribbon-like elements with the chains in the δ conformation; Pβ', formed by lamellae of type β' distorted by periodic ripples. The results emphasize the clear-cut difference between the liquid-like and the other types of partly ordered conformations, as well as the correlations which exist between the chemical composition and the structure of the lipids below the melting temperature of the chains...|$|R

40|$|Acyl chain {{dynamics}} of the trans-unsaturated lipid, dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine (DEPC), were studied by conventional and saturation transfer electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of aqueous dispersions of DEPC spin labeled with <b>lecithins</b> having doxyl groups at positions 5, 10, and 14 on the sn- 2 chain. The gel to liquid crystalline transition is concerted with simultaneous increases in rotational motion about the long axis of the acyl chain (libration) and in gauche-trans conformational interconversions (wobble). Relative to saturated <b>lecithins</b> at similar reduced temperatures the double bond (a) slowed libration by {{an order of magnitude}} in both phases, while wobble motions were several times slower, and (b) -produced a pronounced stiffness of the acyl chain near the double bond. Ethanol (0 - 1. 6 M), in addition to its well-known colligative effect on the phase transition, was found to decrease the bilayer order in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was smaller in the gel than in the liquid crystalline phase, most pronounced next to the double bond, and weakest deep in the bilayer. Ethanol affected slow motions little in the gel phase but wobble and libration correlation times were markedly decreased in the liquid crystalline phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} scan speed, hydrogen and air flow {{rates on the}} flame ionization detection (FID) peak response of phospholipid classes has been studied to determine the optimum levels of these parameters. The phospholipid composition {{of different types of}} commercial <b>lecithins,</b> as well as <b>lecithins</b> combined with fish oils, has been analyzed by Iatroscan TLC‐FID Mark‐ 6 s under optimized conditions. An air flow rate of 2 L/min, a hydrogen flow rate of 150 – 160 mL/min, and a scan speed of 30 s/rod seem to be the ideal conditions for scanning phospholipids with complete pyrolysis in the flame in the Mark‐ 6 model. Increasing the scan speed rapidly decreased the FID response. A hydrogen flow rate as high as 170 mL/min could be used at relatively low air flow rates (&#x 003 C 2 L/min) and the response declined when both air flow rate and hydrogen flow rate increased simultaneously. Both linear and curvilinear relationships had highly significant correlations (p&#x 003 C 0. 01) with the sample load.

25|$|Cholesterol is {{oxidized}} by {{the liver}} into {{a variety of}} bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation, which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (<b>lecithin</b> and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces.|$|E
25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of <b>lecithin</b> (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for nearly half a century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E
