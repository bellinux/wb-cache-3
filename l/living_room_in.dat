To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E

25|$|On June 5, 2006, ManiaTV.com {{announced}} they {{had formed a}} partnership with Green to host a live talk show from his own <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the Hollywood Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley.

A pared-down version was later broadcast on The Comedy Network and various local channels in the United States, until Green stopped syndicating the show to television. On a 2009 blog, Green noted that he stopped his show from syndication on television due to dissatisfaction with his lack of creative control. He continues to broadcast the show from his website. Green later started a monthly subscription service that allowed subscribers to have full {{access to all the}} videos on his website.|$|E
25|$|The label was {{originally}} known as The Shinoda Imprint, named after Mike Shinoda. Machine Shop {{was born in}} drummer Rob Bourdon's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> 1999 when the band was packing CDs and stickers into boxes to send to their very first fans. The label only {{had the potential to}} release the extended plays for the bands fan club annually. Shinoda wanted to release albums of Linkin Park under the label, but the albums were already managed by the parent company Warner Bros. Records, and managing the albums on his alone basis was a difficult job. The first release under the label was for the fan club, LP Underground 2.0, which was released on November 18, 2002. The label also made available some enhanced features, such as T-shirts, sticker, key-chain, a band picture, guitar pick and membership card. The album was co produced by Don Gilmore with Shinoda. On November 17, 2003, the label released another extended play for the LPU fan club, entitled LP Underground 3.0, which featured the unreleased songs in the live album Live in Texas (which was released on November 18, 2003 through the record label).|$|E
25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family can be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will have to do something to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money.

(In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed {{to be a girl}} in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that after she fell pregnant she wished the Conners' baby to be the same gender as hers). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to Walt Disney World. It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney was also the night Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that he survives, as DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan.

500|$|After {{moving to}} 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948—where the Bests lived for nine years—Rory saw a large Victorian house {{for sale at}} 8 Hayman's Green in 1954, and told his mother about it. The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her {{jewellery}} and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby, called [...] "Never Say Die", which won at 33–1, and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957. Note: to place the bet, Mona {{would have had to}} travel more than 220 miles from Liverpool to Epsom (as bets were only allowed at race tracks at the time) or place the bet with an illegal bookmaker in Liverpool. Eight Hayman's Green had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club, and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown. Mona decorated the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> an Oriental style, which reflected her own upbringing in India.

However, in the finale of season seven, House drives his car into Cuddy's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> anger and their relationship effectively ends.|$|E
500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio.

In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall.
