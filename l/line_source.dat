2500|$|The {{standard}} configuration {{as shown in}} the figure to the right requires spatial coherence of the source and consequently is limited to high brilliant synchrotron radiation sources. This problem can be handled by adding a third grating close to the X-ray source, known as a Talbot-Lau interferometer. This source grating, which is usually an absorption grating with transmission slits, creates an [...] "array of individually coherent but mutually incoherent sources". As the source grating can contain a large number of individual apertures, each creating a sufficiently coherent virtual <b>line</b> <b>source,</b> standard X-ray generators with source sizes of a few square millimeters can be used efficiently and the field of view can be significantly increased.|$|E
2500|$|The {{acoustical}} {{science of}} noise barrier design {{is based upon}} treating an airway or railway as a <b>line</b> <b>source.</b> The theory is based upon blockage of sound ray travel toward a particular receptor; however, diffraction of sound must be addressed. Sound waves bend (downward) when they pass an edge, such as the apex of a noise barrier. Barriers that block line of sight of a highway or other source will therefore block more sound. Further complicating matters is the phenomenon of refraction, the bending of sound rays {{in the presence of}} an [...] atmosphere. Wind shear and thermocline produce such inhomogeneities. The sound sources modeled must include engine noise, tire noise, and aerodynamic noise, all of which vary by vehicle type and speed.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{symmetry}} of conventional periodic-permanent-magnet electromagnetic acoustic transducers (PPM EMATs), two shear (SH) waves {{can be generated}} and propagated simultaneously in opposite directions, which makes the signal recognition and interpretation complicatedly. Thus, this work presents a new SH wave PPM EMAT design, rotating the parallel <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> to realize the wave beam focusing in a single-direction. The theoretical model of distributed <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> was deduced firstly, {{and the effects of}} some parameters, such as the inner coil width, adjacent <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> spacing and the angle between parallel <b>line</b> <b>sources,</b> on SH wave focusing and directivity were studied mainly with the help of 3 D FEM. Employing the proposed PPM EMATs, some experiments are carried out to verify the reliability of FEM simulation. The results indicate that rotating the parallel <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> can strength the wave on the closing side of <b>line</b> <b>sources,</b> decreasing the inner coil width and the adjacent <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> spacing can improve the amplitude and directivity of signals excited by transducers. Compared with traditional PPM EMATs, both the capacity of unidirectional excitation and directivity of the proposed PPM EMATs are improved significantly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper aims at {{solving the}} problem of plane {{electromagnetic}} waves scattered by N dielectric coated conducting strips. The method used {{is based on an}} asymptotic technique introduced by Karp and Russek for solving scattering by wide slit. The technique assumes the total scattered field from each coated strip as the sum of the scattered fields from the individual element due to a plane incident wave plus scattered fields from factious <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> of unknown intensity located at the center of every element. The <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> account for the multiple scattering effect. By enforcing the boundary conditions, the intensity of the <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> can be calculated. Numerical examples are introduced for comparison with data published in the literature. 1...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>line</b> <b>source</b> is a {{line from}} which fluid appears and flows away on planes {{perpendicular}} to the line. When we consider 2-D flows on the perpendicular plane, a <b>line</b> <b>source</b> appears as a point source.By symmetry, {{we can assume that}} the fluid flows radially outward from the source.The strength of a source can be given by the volume flow rate [...] that it generates.|$|E
50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>source</b> is a {{hypothetical}} one-dimensional source of sound, {{as opposed to}} the dimensionless point source. As a <b>line</b> <b>source</b> propagates sound equally in all directions in the free field, the sound propagates {{in the shape of a}} cylinder rather than a sphere. Since the surface area of the curved surface of a cylinder = 2π r h, where r is the radius and h is the height, every doubling of the radius results in a doubling of the surface area, thus the sound pressure halves with each doubling of distance from the <b>line</b> <b>source.</b> Since p1 = 1 and p2 = 4 for every distance doubled, this results in a sound pressure decrease of approximately 3 dB.|$|E

40|$|Determination of the {{performance}} of undersampled IR cameras by means of four-bar patterns suffers from aliasing for spatial frequencies above the Nyquist limit. An alternative method, using two parallel <b>line</b> <b>sources,</b> is described. This method avoids the aliasing effect and allows a reproduceable way for performance measurements by simple variation of the spacing between the two <b>line</b> <b>sources</b> and their temperatures. The modulation depth at optimum phase is measured in the camera display or electronics, similar to the classical Rayleigh criterion. Additional benefits of the new method are the simple target construction (only one target is required) and the ease to model <b>line</b> <b>sources.</b> The result of a performance measurement is similar to the standard MRTD (Minimum Resolvable Temperature Difference) method, where sensor resolution is coupled to range for a given target size and contrast. The new method has therefore the potential to be implemented into the present STANAG 4347 and 4349. Results of performance measurements, carried out with the uncooled Thermacam PM 395 camera and other cameras, are shown. Predicted and measured performance agree very well...|$|R
