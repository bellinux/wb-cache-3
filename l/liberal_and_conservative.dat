5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the <b>Liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>Conservative</b> party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration and a loss of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} citizens who combine liberalism {{on one of}} two major issue dimensions with conservatism on the other, assessing whether they are less politically engaged than “consistent ” <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> <b>and</b> whether this relationship has strengthened over time with elite polariza-tion. It also explores the contributions of cross-pressures, partisanship, and alienation to contemporary ideological differences in political engagement. This article departs from most existing research by defining ideology two dimensionally. Using the 1984 - 2008 American National Election Studies, it finds that culturally <b>conservative,</b> economically <b>liberal</b> Americans <b>and</b> {{to a lesser extent}} culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are less engaged in elections than “consistent ” <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives.</b> Different factors explain these differences with <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives,</b> but cross-pressures do not demobilize either “two-dimensional ideologue. ” Over time, the increased involvement of <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> has produced a growing ideological gap in political engagement...|$|R
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as <b>liberal</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservative</b> parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> exhibit {{different}} cognitive {{styles and}} converging lines of evidence suggest that biology influences {{differences in their}} political attitudes and beliefs. In particular, {{a recent study of}} young adults suggests that <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> have significantly different brain structure, with liberals showing increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> showing increased gray matter volume in the in the amygdala. Here, we explore differences in brain function in <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> by matching publicly-available voter records to 82 subjects who performed a risk-taking task during functional imaging. Although the risk-taking behavior of Democrats (<b>liberals)</b> <b>and</b> Republicans (<b>conservatives)</b> did not differ, their brain activity did. Democrats showed significantly greater activity in the left insula, while Republicans showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala. In fact, a two parameter model of partisanship based on amygdala and insula activations yields a better fitting model of partisanship than a well-established model based on parental socialization of party identification long thought {{to be one of the}} core findings of political science. These results suggest that <b>liberals</b> <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> engage different cognitive processes when they think about risk, and they support recent evidence that conservatives show greater sensitivity to threatening stimuli. © 2013 Schreiber et al...|$|R
