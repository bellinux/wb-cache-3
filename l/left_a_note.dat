25|$|Nansen {{believed}} {{he was on the}} west side of the archipelago and planned to reach Svalbard via the predicted Gilles Land, which turned out not to exist. He also aimed to reach Eira Lodge. Johansen, with his head nearly bitten off by a polar bear, and Nansen, exhausted from swimming after the drifting kayaks, were both close to death. By 28August the winter conditions had become so severe that the expedition halted. The pair built a hut and waited for the next season at a spot they named Cape Norvegia. While they believed they were on Alexandra Land, they were in fact on Jackson Island where they sustained themselves on bear and walrus meat and blubber. At Christmas they turned their clothes inside out and from New Year they agreed to address each other with the Norwegian familiar form du i stedet instead of the formal De. They continued their journey on 19 May 1896 and <b>left</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> in the hut, which was found in 1902. The hut was visited by several expeditions, then forgotten until being discovered again in 1990. They continued southwards, with the ultimate goal of reaching Svalbard, until they stumbled upon the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition by pure chance at Cape Flora on17 June.|$|E

50|$|Lord Inverchapel's {{personal}} {{life has been}} described as colourful: a close confidant of the Kaiser's sister in the years before the Great War, he was also a disappointed suitor of the Queen Mother before his marriage, divorce, and remarriage, to a Chilean lady 29 years his junior. Politically on the <b>left,</b> <b>a</b> <b>noted</b> wit and unconventional in manner, he was sometimes suspected of excessive understanding for the Soviet position.

In the New Year they fashioned themselves simple outer clothing—smocks and trousers—from a discarded sleeping bag, in readiness for {{the resumption of}} their journey when the weather grew warmer. On 19 May 1896, after weeks of preparation, they were ready. Nansen <b>left</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> in the hut to inform a possible finder: [...] "We are going south west, along the land, to cross over to Spitsbergen".|$|E
500|$|In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 {{that the}} KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, {{the new head}} of the KGB.

The hackers defaced the homepage and <b>left</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> threatening the Indian Press Club. Despite precautions, the song [...] "Chammak Challo" [...] was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack.

This hiding place became known as the Achterhuis (translated as [...] "Secret Annex" [...] in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto <b>left</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that hinted they were going to Switzerland.
