25|$|Someone {{had become}} rather {{more than a}} <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> over the 160mph lap in 1985, for {{by the time the}} Grand Prix {{returned}} in Silverstone in 1987, a new corner was inserted before Woodcote which changed the character of the circuit. However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maurício Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Trollé in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} change, insisted on by Rutledge, {{was meant to}} sharply curtail the {{essentially}} unlimited powers to legislate [...] "in all cases for the general interests of the Union" [...] that the Convention only two weeks earlier had agreed to grant the Congress. Rutledge and Randolph worried that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the Convention {{would have given the}} national government too much power {{at the expense of the}} states. In Randolph's outline the committee replaced that language with a list of 18 specific [...] "enumerated" [...] powers, many adopted from the Articles of Confederation, that would strictly limit the Congress' authority to measures such as imposing taxes, making treaties, going to war, and establishing post offices. Rutledge, however, was not able to completely convince all of the members of the committee to accept the change. Over the course of a series of drafts, a catchall provision (the [...] "Necessary and Proper Clause") was eventually added, most likely by Wilson, a nationalist <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> with the sovereignty of individual states, giving the Congress the broad power [...] "to make all Laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." [...] Another revision of Wilson's draft also placed eight specific limits on the states, such as barring them from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own money, providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the national government intended by Rutledge's list of enumerated powers. In addition, Wilson's draft modified the language of the Supremacy Clause adopted by the Convention, to ensure that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state laws.|$|E

2500|$|DeFreeze {{had been}} active in the Black Cultural Association while at the California Medical Facility, a state prison {{facility}} in Vacaville, California, where he had made contacts with members of Venceremos. He sought refuge among these contacts, and ended up at a commune known as Peking House in the San Francisco Bay Area. [...] Venceremos associates and future SLA members Willie Wolfe and Russell <b>Little,</b> <b>concerned</b> with the potential for surveillance at the high profile Peking House to uncover DeFreeze, arranged for DeFreeze to move in with their associate Patricia Michelle Soltysik in the relative anonymity of Concord, CA. DeFreeze and Soltysik became lovers and began to outline the plans for founding the [...] "Symbionese Nation".|$|E
2500|$|Bonser named {{eleven of}} the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using the {{character}} of the obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before twisting off to the right. Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons until the HBC replaced her with a new sternwheeler in 1898, also named the Caledonia. By this time, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing and there was more interest in the north than ever previously. Robert Cunningham had prospered during this period and now owned a cannery and a lumber mill. He decided that a sternwheeler would be a fine addition to his enterprises, and he bought the Monte Cristo and hired Captain Bonser away from the HBC to pilot it. The HBC built a second sternwheeler, the Strathcona, and were <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> about Cunningham’s rival vessel.|$|E
2500|$|On this background, in April 1839, {{the spiritual}} {{leadership}} of the Hamburg Temple decided to draft a second edition of its prayerbook, indeed the only new Reform liturgy since the former. Approaching its semi-jubilee, the directorate believed it was high time {{to break out of}} the isolation and gain the influence they believed accorded their association. The commission in charge comprised Gotthold Salomon, Eduard Kley, Bresselau and Fränkel. Kley resigned from the temple, replaced as preacher by Naphtali Frankfurter, and Bresselau died on 25 December. They declared that the new tome must express the [...] "pure teaching of out ancestral religion", and all that contrasted it [...] "must be removed." [...] In comparison to the Wissenschaft-inspired rabbinical cadre the Hamburg commission was still quite dilettante, lacking a well-defined ideological stance, a matter which <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> them. It also had to accommodate a diverse congregation and maintain its legitimacy within the wider community. [...] "Not a few" [...] among its constituents, as Meyer commented, were rather conservative, even strictly observant, and had no interest in far-reaching modifications. Their aim was to compose an inspiring liturgy, not a theologically consistent one.|$|E

2500|$|Highrise office {{buildings}} designed and constructed between [...] and [...] are {{a specific type}} of architecture that evolved under particular circumstances. The type clearly represents the excitement, prosperity, and vision of Australia and indicates the economic rationalism and progress in the period. Indicating their status, they were often ceremoniously opened by important dignitaries. In cities nationally and internationally, Modernist architects were unencumbered by traditions when designing this new type, challenging aesthetic and symbolic values, and the provision of public and private amenity. Their impact was unprecedented and it was not until critical analysis of tall buildings in the late 1960s that the approach to highrise development changed. Designed in a time when Australia was <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> about the ethics of energy consumption, typical highrises exploited this abundance. Orientation and shading was generally dismissed and windows were inoperable, relying on mechanical air-conditioning. Floor plates were vast, relying on artificial light. However, some architects designed intelligent buildings that were connected to the traditions of architecture and were better attuned to their environment. Sophisticated in its design, Langer's MRD Building is representative of the better designs in Queensland of the period.|$|E
2500|$|Pete's {{original}} character outline {{as written}} by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, : [...] "Pete runs a fruit and veg stall in the market....married very young to Pat (Pam St. Clement) - It {{turned out to}} be a total disaster. They were too young, rushing into a difficult life for all the wrong reasons, and truthfully, his wife was a vicious shrew ... he divorced his wife and married Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) when he was 24 ... Ian [...] (Adam Woodyatt) was born a year later. It took Kathy and Pete about ten years to woo [...] Lou (Anna Wing) round to the idea of their marriage, and she can still sometimes be a bit cutting about it.... She doesn't believe in divorce ... He did have crazy dreams of making something of himself, he was going to be [...] singer, a red-coat, run his own hotel ... On special occasions it's always Pete who's the life and soul of the party.... His two sons by his first marriage are nineteen and twenty and he hardly sees them.... If it wasn't for Thatcher, he'd consider voting Tory.... Never works on the anniversary of his dad's death, and with [...] Pauline (Wendy Richard), escorts his mum to the cemetery. He has a good relationship with Kathy, emotionally and sexually (Maybe he's a <b>little</b> <b>concerned</b> that she's keeping her good looks a bit longer than he is?).|$|E
