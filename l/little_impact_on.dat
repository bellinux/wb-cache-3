5|$|Although it made <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> {{its first}} publication, the 1906 novel Love Among the Chickens {{contained}} what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's Globe colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, Brother Alfred.

5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but {{there was not much}} public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E

Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> shipping.

5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the wider world – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E

40|$|China is now {{the third}} largest {{bioethanol}} producer in the world after the United State and Brazil. The overall goals of this paper are to {{provide an overview of}} China's current bioethanol program, its future trend, and the likely <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> its agricultural economy in the future. The analysis shows that China has developed an ambitious long-run biofuel program with a series of financial and institutional supports. While there are several potential feedstock crops available for bioethanol production, lack of land for feedstock production is one of major constraints in China's bioethanol expansion. The results show that although China's bioethanol expansion will have <b>little</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> overall agricultural prices in international markets, it will have significant <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the prices, productions, and trade of those energy crops being used for bioethanol production in China. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, and interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{occupation}} {{of what is}} now southern Scotland seems to have had very <b>little</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts in the south and Brochs and wheel houses in the north, continuing to be occupied in the Early Medieval period. The study of place names and archaeological evidence indicates a pattern of early Medieval settlement by the Picts, most densely around the north-east coastal plain; early Gaelic settlement was predominately in the western mainland and neighbouring islands. Anglian settlement in the south-east reached into West Lothian, {{and to a lesser extent}} into south-western Scotland. Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland, with lighter settlement in the Western Islands.|$|E

50|$|On December 23, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} Mozambique Channel, accompanied by spiral rainbands toward the center. That day, the system reached peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph), and the Madagascar Meteorological Service named it Alifredy. The storm moved quickly southeastward toward Madagascar. High pressures to the south prevented much development, and Alifredy moved ashore near Morondava in western Madagascar on December 24 at peak intensity. While crossing the island, the storm weakened into {{a tropical}} depression. Alifredy emerged into the open Indian Ocean and failed to restrengthen. It became extratropical and turned southeastward, dissipating on December 27 within the westerlies. The JTWC did not track the storm.
