25|$|At {{the start}} of 2010, the University {{controversially}} adopted a new logo. It retains the same university arms, however it takes on a more modern <b>look.</b> <b>There</b> have been stylistic changes, the main one being the coat of arm's mantling, {{the shape of the}} escutcheon (shield), the removal of the motto scroll, and also others more subtle within the arms itself, such as the mane and fur of the lion, the number of lines in the open book and the colouration. The original Coat of Arms from 1857 continues to be used for ceremonial and other formal purposes, such as on testamurs.|$|E

While some attendees enjoyed the new <b>look,</b> <b>there</b> was backlash from disappointed fans who had hoped for a more realistic Zelda {{along the lines of}} the 2000 demo. Critics derisively dubbed the game [...] "Celda". Miyamoto was surprised at the response, and decided to limit revealing further information about the game until the team finished a playable demonstration, hoping to shift focus from the graphics to the gameplay.|$|E

Still smarting from criticism over the Sex book, she [...] into a softer, more gentle image. Yet despite the pastel tones {{of her new}} <b>look,</b> <b>there</b> was also a sense of grit. She combined this to startling effect with the music video for 'Secret'." [...] Madonna knew that a lot was riding on her first visual after the Erotica era, and wanted to create an effect with it. The video was directed by Melodie McDaniel, who had previously gained acclaim as a photographer for album artwork and also as music video director for bands like The Cranberries and Porno for Pyros. However, Madonna {{was more interested in}} one of McDaniel's earlier short films, where she portrayed baptism combining with voodoo rituals. She enlisted McDaniel and explained that she was [...] "drawn to the rawness of [...] film". Madonna wanted to tone down her image and according to McDaniel: ...|$|E
500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, <b>look,</b> <b>there</b> are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|To {{the east}} of the combat between Superb and Saint Antoine, the fire on Real Carlos blazed out of control, {{spreading}} throughout the ship. In the darkness, the blazing vessel stood out and was mistaken by the crew of San Hermenegildo for a British ship. Despite specific orders from Moreno for his captains to be sure of their targets, San Hermenegildo closed with the burning ship and fired several broadsides into Real Carlos. The attack prompted a response and the two huge warships began a close exchange of fire that was only brought to a close when Real Carlos drifted into San Hermenegildo, the flames spreading from the former's sails to the latter. Saumarez, on witnessing the sight, excitedly exclaimed to Brenton [...] "My God sir, <b>look</b> <b>there!</b> The day is ours!" [...] Within minutes both ships were tangled together, fire spreading unchecked throughout the vessels. The fire was too dangerous for British ships to make any rescue attempts, and although several hundred men managed to escape the wrecks on small boats, there were still more than 1,700 sailors on board when first the Real Carlos at 00:15 and then the San Hermenegildo at 01:00 exploded as the flames reached their central magazines, killing both crews. 262 survivors in boats were taken aboard the captured Saint Antoine and 38 on Superb, while a handful managed to reach the rest of the Franco-Spanish squadron, but the enormous loss of life in this incident {{was one of the worst}} maritime disasters to that time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} was not fully understood when first {{exhibited at the}} Paris Salon of 1842. If the critics recognized an insipidness in Esther's expression—one journalist complained [...] "But why that elongated figure, those wild eyes, that savage <b>look?</b> <b>There</b> is no soul under that face..."—they failed to properly appreciate the originality of a biblical story re-imagined in an erotic, Romantic fashion. The painting would later inspire painters such as François-Léon Benouville and Gustave Moreau.|$|E

In a 2009 interview with reporter Shihab Rattansi, Ellison expressed his disappointment at his inability to see the humanitarian situation for himself.

2500|$|Samuel Reid, a {{volunteer}} from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as [...] "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [...] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, {{while others were}} grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers {{and many of his}} men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, {{it was hard to tell}} who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw <b>look,</b> <b>there</b> were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writers {{developed}} Superman's powers gradually. Since the beginning, {{he has had}} superhuman {{strength and}} a nigh-invulnerable body. In the earliest comics, Superman travels by running and leaping. [...] In the radio serial that began in 1940, Superman {{has the ability to}} fly.-Look! <b>Look!</b> <b>There,</b> in the sky! It's a man!-Why, he's flying!-It can't be! It's impossible! Fleischer Studios also depicted Superman flying in a theatrical animated series they produced that same decade, because this required fewer frames of animation, and their animation tests of Superman leaping looked [...] "silly" [...] anyway. X-ray vision is introduced in Action Comics #11 (April 1939) and heat vision in Superman #59 (Aug. 1949). [...] Originally, Superman's powers were common on Krypton, but in later stories they are activated by the light of Earth's yellow sun, and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton's sun.|$|E

2500|$|Like other Antarctic Press characters, {{action figures}} {{containing}} {{most of the}} chief characters in various colors and designs were made. However, {{in addition to the}} standard <b>look,</b> <b>there</b> was also an anime look based on a failed attempt by Ben Dunn and Antarctic Press to make a Warrior Nun Areala American anime in 1994. There were high hopes and would have been partially fan funded with contributors donating $125 in exchange for their names in the credits. However, that never panned out with the money necessary for Sunrise, the hoped for animation studio, to make the series being about $200,000. In 2001 another attempt was made by Darkain Arts though that too failed. The anime was never completed and only the opening credits are known to exist; they were created by the animators of the X-Men animated series. The opening credits can be seen on [...]|$|E

On 31 December 1942, she attacked a cargo ship loaded with planes. Trigger fired three torpedoes from extremely close range , and watched two hit. The target began to list to starboard and was down by the bow. Sound reported a heavy secondary explosion. The submarine came up to periscope level and saw the freighter with her stern high {{out of the water and}} a destroyer approaching.
