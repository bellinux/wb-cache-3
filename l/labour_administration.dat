5|$|In 1936 the new <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street, {{near the}} site of the Red Cross Hall and the scene of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today.

5|$|The {{governing}} <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> led by Gordon Brown {{was defeated}} in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won {{the largest number of}} seats in the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government.|$|E

25|$|The National Assembly {{consists}} of 60 elected members. They use the title Assembly Member (AM) or Aelod y Cynulliad (AC).

25|$|With the Lords and Commons {{unable to}} come to {{agreement}} {{by the end of}} the Parliamentary year the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached. The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions. The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation; however other newspapers and broadcasters condemned Tony Blair's <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.|$|E
25|$|After {{a change}} of {{government}} in 1997, the <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> decided to keep the Post Office state-owned but with more commercial freedom. This led to the Postal Services Act 2000, where the Post Office became a public limited company in which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry owned 50,004 ordinary shares plus 1 special share, and the Treasury Solicitor held 1 ordinary share. The company was renamed Consignia plc in 2001 and the new name was intended {{to show that the}} company did more than deliver mail; however, the change was very unpopular with both the public and employees. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) boycotted the name, and the following year, it was announced that the company would be renamed Royal Mail Group plc.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} approach of {{management by objectives}} (MBO) is currently experiencing a renaissance in European labour market policy. This paper first recapitulates key conceptional principles of the management by objectives model and stresses {{the relevance of the}} moral hazard problem. Then there is an empirical overview of approaches of management by objectives in the <b>labour</b> <b>administrations</b> of the EU and of Norway. A consolidating comparison of countries is devoted to the {{management approach}}es used in the <b>labour</b> <b>administrations</b> of Austria, Great Britain, France, Sweden and Germany. In particular advantages and disadvantages of objectives and indicators, implementation problems and aspects of performance assessment and comparison of performance are discussed. On the basis of this, finally the merits and weaknesses of management by objectives in labour market policy are discussed.

40|$|From {{within the}} context of the planned {{expansion}} of the European Union (EU) to include the 12 applicant states from central and eastern Europe and the predicted reduction of the European financial support given to the UK, the article draws on empirical data to explore the impact of the European Social Fund (ESF) on the further education sector and the process of widening participation. Despite the significance of the ESF in implementing vocational education and training (VET) policy, it has been consistently erased by both the Conservative and <b>Labour</b> <b>administrations.</b> Whereas this erasure can be traced back to Britain's membership in 1973, the focus of the article is on the peirod 1997 - 2000, for Labour's Welfare to Work policies draw heavily on the financial support given by the EU trhough the ESF. It is suggested that, whereas the continued erasure of the Fund can be contextualised by the continued (and poltically contentious) membership of the EU, its public erasure enables it to play a vital, flexible and unaccountable role in the VET policies of Conservative and <b>Labour</b> <b>administrations...</b>|$|R
25|$|On 4 October 1981, {{following}} the Greater London Council election, the incoming <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named City and West End, where flat fares {{applied for the}} first time. This {{was accompanied by a}} cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the Fares Fair campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Bus fares were doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three mile intervals; and thus grouping those stations within three miles of the central zones in an 'inner zone'.|$|E
25|$|Jenkin {{decided to}} limit the 1985/86 budget of 15 of these councils to the cash level of their 1984/85 budget. In the cases of the GLC, ILEA and Greenwich, where budgets were over 70% above their grant-related expenditure, and had gone up by more than 30% since 1981/82, he placed the cap at 1½% below the 1984/85 budget. 16 out of the 18 councils were under {{majority}} control by Labour {{at the time they}} were designated. The exceptions were Portsmouth, where there was a Conservative majority, and Brent where no party had an overall majority. A <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> had held power but when Labour councillor Ambrozine Neil joined the Conservatives in December 1983, the Conservatives took control with Liberal support.|$|E
25|$|At the 2013 {{county council}} elections, control of Kent County Council {{was held by}} the Conservatives, which won 44 of the council's 83 seats. 17 seats were won by the United Kingdom Independence Party, 13 by the Labour Party, 7 were won by the Liberal Democrats, 1 by the Green Party and 1 by the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association. At the 2007 local elections, control of Medway Council was held by the Conservatives; 33 of the council's 55 seats were held by the Conservatives, 13 by the Labour Party, 8 by the Liberal Democrats and 1 by an Independent. All but one of Kent's {{district}} councils are controlled by the Conservatives, a minority <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> taking control of Thanet District in December 2011 following the defection of a Conservative councillor to the Independent group. In the council elections of May 2015 the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) {{took control of the}} Council, the first and so far only one in the UK. In October 2015 UKIP lost overall control following a series of resignations, although remaining the largest party, only for UKIP to regain control once more following ward elections in August 2016.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} seven decades of the borough's {{existence}} it was dominated by the Liberal Party, who maintained a large majority.

500|$|In September 2012, Lamont {{announced}} a policy review of Scotland's universal benefits, signalling that a future <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> would reverse {{many of the}} free services introduced since power was devolved to Scotland.

Although Radio Enoch had vowed to return if a <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> was re-elected, it failed to do so after Tony Blair was elected in 1997. Other political radio broadcasters are Interference FM, set up by a collective to broadcast on the J18 demonstrations in 1999.

500|$|In 1946, {{three years}} after Hall's death, Troubridge wanted to include The Well in a Collected Memorial Edition of Hall's works. Peter Davies of the Windmill Press wrote to the Home Office's legal adviser to ask whether the post-war <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> would allow the book to be republished. Unknown to Troubridge, he added a {{postscript}} saying [...] "I am not really anxious to do The Well of Loneliness and am rather relieved than otherwise by any lack of enthusiasm I may encounter in official circles." [...] Home Secretary James Chuter Ede told Troubridge that any publisher reprinting the book would risk prosecution. In 1949 Falcon Press brought out an edition with no legal challenge. The Well has been in print continuously ever since and has been translated into at least 14 languages. In the 1960s it was still selling 100,000 copies {{a year in the}} United States alone. Looking back on the controversy in 1972, Flanner remarked on how unlikely it seemed that a [...] "rather innocent" [...] book like The Well could have created such a scandal. In 1974, it was read to the British public on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime.|$|E
500|$|Bondfield later {{described}} her first months in government as [...] "a strange adventure". The {{difficulties of the}} economic situation would have created problems for the most experienced of governments, and the fledgling <b>Labour</b> <b>administration</b> was quickly in difficulties. Bondfield {{spent much of her}} time abroad; in the autumn she travelled to Canada as the head of a delegation examining the problems of British immigrants, especially as related to the welfare of young children. When she returned to Britain in early October she found the government in its final throes. On 8 October MacDonald resigned after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons. Labour's chances of victory in the ensuing general election were fatally compromised by the controversy surrounding the so-called Zinoviev letter, a missive purportedly sent by Grigory Zinoviev, president of the Communist International, which called on Britain's socialists to prepare for violent revolution. The letter, published four days before polling day, generated a [...] "Red Scare" [...] that led to a significant swing of voters to the right, and ensured a massive Conservative victory. Bondfield lost her seat in Northampton by 971 votes.|$|E
