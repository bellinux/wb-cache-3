40|$|Aim: Cryptosporidium is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that causes}} diarrhea, which is typically a short-lasting benign infection. The aimof {{the present study}} was to determinate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kids in Kurdistandistrict, Iran. Materials and Methods: Atotal of 1200 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic <b>and</b> non-diarrheic <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kidsaged 1 to 6 months from 48 villages in the Kurdistan province, west of Iran. The samples were tested for the presence ofCryptosporidium spp. oocysts using modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining method. Results: Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were present in 10. 24 % of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> in 18. 86 % of goat kids. Both diarrhea andCryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in 64. 37 % (56 / 87) of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> in 30. 51 % (18 / 59) of goat kids. Cryptosporidium spp. infection rates were significantly higher in diarrheic than in non-diarrheic groups. The highest rate ofinfection was found in an animal aged one month. Furthermore, the prevalence of the infection according to age groups andconsistency of feces was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: The presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kids in Kurdistan indicates that this protozoan parasiteshould also be considered in the etiology of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kids exhibiting diarrhea...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Cryptosporidium infection among <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kids in Serbia was examined. The animals were grouped according to age, i. e., up to 30 days and from 31 to 90 days. The infection was diagnosed using three coprological procedures. Sheather’s sugar flotation {{was employed to}} determine the concentration of oocysts. Modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique and modified Kinyoun technique were used as staining procedures. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 42. 1 % examined <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 31. 8 % goat kids. These findings clearly demonstrate the presence of Cryptospodium infection in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goat kids in Serbia and indicate the potential role of these animals as reservoirs of cryptosporidia...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the perinatal period on redox status indicators in the blood of ewes before <b>and</b> after <b>lambing</b> <b>and</b> during lactation. The study was performed on 12 ewes of the synthetic SCP line. Blood for testing of redox parameters was collected seven times: before pregnancy, 1. 5 months and 24 h before <b>lambing,</b> 2 <b>and</b> 24 h after <b>lambing,</b> <b>and</b> in the fourth and eighth weeks of lactation. The following blood indices were determined by spectrophotometry: lipid peroxides, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, plasma total antioxidant capacity, uric acid, urea, bilirubin, and creatinine. The tests showed that during the perinatal period reactions are generated which lead to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in pregnant ewes was found to increase during the period before <b>lambing</b> <b>and</b> may persist even up to weeks 4 - 8 of lactation...|$|R

5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both <b>Lamb</b> <b>and</b> Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the risk factors that are associated with neonatal mortality in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids in Jordan. The bacterial causes of mortality in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids were investigated. One hundred sheep and goat flocks were selected randomly from different areas of North Jordan {{at the beginning of the}} lambing season. The flocks were visited every other week to collect information and to take samples from freshly dead animals. By the end of the lambing season, flocks that had neonatal mortality rate 1. 0 % were considered as “case group ” while flocks that had neonatal mortality rate less than 1. 0 % as “control group”. The results indicated that neonatal mortality rate (within 4 weeks of age), in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids, was 3. 2 %. However, the early neonatal mortality rate (within 48 hours of age) was 2. 01 % and represented 62. 1 % of the neonatal mortalities. The following risk factors were found to be associated with the neonatal mortality in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids: not separating the neonates from adult animals; not vaccinating dams against infectious diseases (pasteurellosis, colibacillosis and enterotoxemia); walking more than 5 km and starvation-mismothering exposure. The causes of neona-tal mortality in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids were: diarrhea (59. 75 %), respiratory diseases (13. 3 %), unknown causes (12. 34 %), and accident (8. 39 %). Bacteria responsible for neonatal mortality were: Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. However, E. coli was the most frequent bacterial species identified as cause of neonatal mortality in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> kids and represented 63. 4 % of all bacterial isolates. The E. coli isolates belonged to 10 serogroups, the O 44 and O 26 being the most frequent isolates...|$|R
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by <b>Lamb</b> <b>and</b> Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E

50|$|Good {{nutrition}} {{is vital}} to ewes during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy {{in order to prevent}} pregnancy toxaemia, especially in twin bearing ewes. Overfeeding, however, may result in over large single <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> dystocia. Shearing ewes before lambing reduces the number of ewes that are cast (i.e. unable to rise unassisted), and the number of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> ewes that are lost. Lambs, too, are aided in finding the udder and suckling a shorn ewe.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on plasma Zn and serum thyroid hormones was {{evaluated}} in healthy male Merino <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> Angora goats. A total of 12 <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 12 goats {{were divided into}} two equal groups as control and Zn groups in separate experiments. The <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goats of the control groups were fed basal rations alone. The Zn contents of these rations prepared for <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goats were 40 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg in dry matter (DM), respectively. Both species of animals in the Zn groups were fed a basal ration supplemented with zinc sulphate adjusted to 250 mg Zn/kg diet in DM. The feeding trial lasted for 12 weeks in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 8 weeks in goats. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein at 4 -week intervals. Both animal species in the Zn groups had higher plasma Zn values than the controls throughout the experimental period, except in the 4 th week in goats. However, the levels of serum total thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) were lower in the <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> goats of the Zn groups, except in the 4 th week, as compared to those in the controls. Moreover, serum total thyroid hormone levels of the goats were higher at the 4 th week than at the 8 th week. Although there was a decrease in the levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine of both small ruminant species in the Zn groups when compared to the controls, these alterations were not statistically significant. These results may show that zinc supplementation to the diet at this dose reduces total thyroid hormone levels in small ruminants but does not yet impair the euthyroid status of the organism. ...|$|R

5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, <b>Lamb</b> <b>and</b> Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis <b>Lamb</b> <b>and</b> his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
