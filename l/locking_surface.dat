25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E

50|$|The chamber {{block is}} locked to the handle block, which {{contains}} the <b>locking</b> <b>surface,</b> firing button (pushed by the trigger when the chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. The cartridge primers are ignited electrically, {{so there are}} four circular contact plates on the <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> (contacting the case bottom) and four contact pins {{in the center of}} each plate (contacting the primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. The electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. The weapon is only capable of firing one round at a time. There are different models of PB-4; in some, the firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others by a piezoelectric igniter similar to those used by kitchen gas lighters.|$|E

40|$|Topological {{insulators}} embody a {{newly discovered}} {{state of matter}} characterized by conducting spin-momentum <b>locked</b> <b>surface</b> states that span the bulk band gap. So far, most of the study on topological insulator surfaces has been limited to understanding their properties without strong Coulomb perturbation or breaking of time reversal symmetry. We have used deposited iron, with a large positive ionization state and significant magnetic moment as a strong probe to modify the surface electronic structure of the Bi 2 Se 3 surface at the gap energy scale. We observe that such perturbation leads {{to the creation of}} multiple Dirac fermions consistent with Z 2 or Mod(2) symmetry.

Compared to the preceding R93 rifle series for additional safety the barrel has been thickened at the critical part, the groove has been enlarged and the locking angle of the collets has been steepened. Further the radial collet opens differently.

50|$|The GSh-18 is a rotating-barrel, short recoil, locked-breech pistol with 10 locking lugs spaced equally {{around the}} barrel, the large <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> area {{resulting}} in a strong lockup, making it suitable for high-velocity ammunition loads. The GSh-18 may be employed using standard 9x19mm Parabellum rounds, but was designed for the high velocity, Russian armour-piercing 7N31 9x19mm round. The pistol incorporates a pre-set striker. The slide and working parts are steel, and the weapon has a polymer frame. Two different designs of grip have been observed. The magazine capacity is 18 rounds, and an additional round may be carried in the chamber. The magazine release is reversible for left-handed shooters and the ejector doubles as a loaded chamber indicator. The magazines are a double stack design common to many modern handguns. The GSh-18 pistol contains only 17 parts (by comparison, the Glock 17 contains 34 parts).|$|E

The two main locking lugs display a <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> of 56 mm², whilst the third safety lug normally plays no part in locking the action to avoid asymmetric and hence unbalanced bolt thrust forces. The diameter of the receiver was also enlarged compared to previous Mauser receivers for additional strength and safety. The bolt handle is permanently attached to the bolt and on the Mauser M 98 series is turned-down for use with optical sights.|$|E

Here, we report an ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study on topological crystalline insulator SnTe nanoplates grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observed quasiparticle interference patterns on the SnTe (001) surface that can be interpreted in terms of electron scattering from the four Fermi pockets of the topological crystalline insulator surface states in the first surface Brillouin zone. A quantitative analysis of the energy dispersion of the quasiparticle interference intensity shows two high energy features related to the crossing point beyond the Lifshitz transition when the two neighboring low energy surface bands near the point merge.

40|$|Introducing, observing, and {{manipulating}} individual impurities {{coupled to}} a host material offers the opportunity to create new device concepts based on single spin and charge states. Because of potential applications in spintronics and magneto-electrics, such an approach would be particularly useful for topological insulators (TI), a recently discovered material class hosting spin-momentum- <b>locked</b> <b>surface</b> states. To make them useful for new technologies, a robust control of their interaction with external perturbations is required. However, traditional approaches such as metal electrodes or doping proved to be problematic and resulted in strong mesoscopic fluctuations making the spin-momentum locking ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate the effective gating of TIs by coupling molecules to their surface which, by using electric fields, allow to dynamically control the interface charge state by adding or removing single electrons. This process creates a robust transconductance bistability resembling a single-electron transistor. Our findings make hybrid molecule/TI interfaces functional elements {{while at the same}} time pushing miniaturization at its ultimate limit.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} topological insulators embody a {{newly discovered}} {{state of matter}} characterized by conducting spin-momentum <b>locked</b> <b>surface</b> states that span the bulk band gap as demonstrated via spin-resolved ARPES measurements. This highly unusual surface environment provides a rich ground for the discovery of novel physical phenomena. Here we present the first controlled study of the topological insulator surfaces under strong Coulomb, magnetic and disorder perturbations. We have used interaction of iron, with a large Coulomb state and significant magnetic moment as a probe to systematically test the robustness of the topological surface states of the model topological insulator Bi_ 2 Se_ 3. We observe that strong perturbation leads {{to the creation of}} odd multiples of Dirac fermions and that magnetic interactions break time reversal symmetry in the presence of band hybridization. We also present a theoretical model to account for the altered surface of Bi_ 2 Se_ 3.

As the two escape wheels A and B rotate meshed together, {{one of them is}} locked when an impulse/locking tooth, standing upright from the escape wheel, rests on the wide straight locking stone of the detent. In the figure the balance is rotating counter-clockwise and just at the point that the unlocking pallet C on the balance is about to move the detent D to release peg E on escape wheel A which is resting on the jewelled <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> underneath the detent arm. The impulse pallet F mounted on the balance staff just below the unlocking pallet C will have moved in front of peg G whilst the balance completes its unlocking arc. When the peg E is released by the detent, the escape wheels accelerate together and peg G will deliver an impulse on the jewelled rear face of impulse pallet F. After the impulse arc, tooth H from the escape wheel B locks {{on the other end of}} the detent locking jewel which has now been moved into its path.

50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the <b>locking</b> <b>surface</b> on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|E

In a topological insulator, the bulk energy gap is traversed by spin-momentum <b>locked</b> <b>surface</b> states forming an odd number of surface bands that possesses unique electronic properties. However, transport measurements have often been dominated by residual bulk carriers from crystal defects or environmental doping which mask the topological surface contribution.

(BixSb 1 -x) 2 Te 3 ternary compounds are confirmed as topological insulators for the entire composition range by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and ab initio calculations. Additionally, we observe a clear ambipolar gating effect similar to that observed in graphene using nanoplates of (BixSb 1 -x) 2 Te 3 in field-effect-transistor (FET) devices.
