5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E
5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|Born in Barstow, California, Tyler {{moved to}} Oceanside, California where he starred as halfback at El Camino High School. After {{receiving}} {{a number of}} awards following his senior season, he was recruited to the University of Washington. With the Washington Huskies, he played mainly as a fullback. The Huskies won the 1978 Rose Bowl his freshman year, and he started {{for the first time}} in a game the following season. The back took a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in his junior year as the team went 10–2 and won a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013–14 season, Auguste was {{expected}} to play a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> after Cooley graduated and coach Mike Brey cited him as a major player. Though he did start 13 games out of 30, he stayed third choice with Sherman and Tom Knight preferred. He recorded his first college double-double against Clemson having 14 points and 12 rebounds, followed by no-shows. He finished his sophomore season with 6.7 points and 4.3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{government}} of India nominated Tharoor for the post of UN Secretary-General. Had he won, the 50-year-old Shashi Tharoor would have become the second-youngest Secretary-General, after the 46-year-old Dag Hammarskjöld. Although all previous Secretaries-General had come from small countries, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan felt that Tharoor's candidacy would demonstrate India's willingness to play a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> at the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much <b>larger</b> <b>role.</b> A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

Actors Bradley Stryker, as Ryan's brother Trey, and Shailene Woodley, as Marissa's younger sister Kaitlin, were both only guest stars at this point.

5|$|World WarII led to {{significant}} changes to Australian society.

The impact of World WarII changed Australian society, and contributed {{to the development of a}} more cosmopolitan society in which women were able to play a <b>larger</b> <b>role.</b> The war also resulted in a greater maturity in Australia's approach to international affairs, as demonstrated by the development of a more independent foreign policy and the encouragement of mass immigration after the war.|$|E
5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Sherman {{began to take}} a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in politics. In 1844, he {{addressed}} a political rally {{on behalf of the}} Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E

5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of social science research.|$|E
5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a <b>larger</b> <b>role</b> in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
