5000|$|Mr. Barthe, {{editor of}} the Star, wrote that [...] "the <b>letter</b> is <b>ornamented</b> <b>with</b> a coffin, skull, cross-bone, pistol & dagger. A reward will be paid to any person {{introducing}} the writer of the above." [...] Samuel L. French, who was Burgess of Plymouth when this letter was published, mentioned the Molly Maguires in his history, Reminiscences of Plymouth, Pa., writing that [...] "one of their number named Dunleavy was mysteriously shot one evening in a saloon on East Main Street, which incident {{had the effect of}} putting a quietus on the band in Plymouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{doctrine}} he, {{like his}} patron, is tolerant of dissent, if so strict a mind {{can be called}} tolerant of anything. With Wesleyan-Methodists he has something in common, but his soul trembles in agony at the iniquities of the Puseyites. His aversion is carried to things outward as well as inward. His gall rises at a new church with a high-pitched roof; a full-breasted black silk waistcoat is with him a symbol of Satan; and a profane jest-book would not, in his view, more foully desecrate the church seat of a Christian than a book of prayer printed <b>with</b> red <b>letters</b> and <b>ornamented</b> <b>with</b> a cross on the back. Most active clergymen have their hobby, and Sunday observances are his. Sunday, however, is a word which never pollutes his mouth--it is always [...] "the Sabbath." [...] The [...] "desecration of the Sabbath," [...] as he delights to call it, is to him meat and drink: he thrives upon that as policemen do on the general evil habits of the community. It is the loved subject of all his evening discourses, {{the source of all}} his eloquence, the secret of all his power over the female heart. To him the revelation of God appears only in that one law given for Jewish observance. To him the mercies of our Saviour speak in vain, to him in vain has been preached that sermon which fell from divine lips on the mountain--"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth"--"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." [...] To him the New Testament is comparatively of little moment, for from it can he draw no fresh authority for that dominion which he loves to exercise over at least a seventh part of man's allotted time here below.|$|R
