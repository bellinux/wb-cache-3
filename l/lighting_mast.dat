50|$|The Waldaschaff {{fire brigade}} {{was founded in}} 1873 as a {{volunteer}} firefighting service. Until the 1950s, the Waldaschaff fire brigade’s main task was fighting fires, until technical assistance, for instance on the Autobahn, came to the fore. Along with this came changes to the fire brigade’s fleet, so that the Waldaschaff fire brigade now keeps 11 vehicles and three trailers, {{two of which are}} traffic safety trailers. The fleet also features various special vehicles like a turntable ladder and a <b>lighting</b> <b>mast</b> van.|$|E

The playing field, which is uncharacteristically open for the {{surrounding}} area, compromises four distinct functional elements: a vast sculpt-tural <b>lighting</b> <b>mast,</b> a robust ball stop net, a paddling pool with a wide concrete rim and a shade structure, all of which offer a contrast to the monochrome lawn.

40|$|High <b>Mast</b> <b>Light</b> {{gives the}} several cost {{effective}} advantages and cost {{is a major}} issue for rural area general services. This project illustrates the theoretical basis and the analytical development of the high <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> poles. In the late 1960 "s, studies were conducted to investigate the impact that high-mast lighting gives on traffic performance, driver visibility, and illumination costs. It was found that increasing {{the height of the}} lighting offered a noticeable advantage in that it provided drivers with increased uniformity of illumination and brightness while minimizing discomfort and disability glare. In this turn, it`s led to a reduced number of visibility related accidents. Also, lighting is a major requirement when we deal with working at the opencast mining. In opencast mining, the efficient lighting system is required while working during dark hours. In the present work, a new system of <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> tower is proposed & designed which increases the usability of the existing <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> towers. In this solution, each <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> is given a particular position to its vertical & horizontal axis which sets the light to focus in any particular area and direction to cover target area with minimum power and resource...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{reports a}} case study of wind induced vortex {{shedding}} vibrations of a steel <b>light</b> <b>mast.</b> The vibrations are examined, full scale observations reported and the coun-termeasures devised to reduce the motions are described. The across wind motion of the mast was observed in windy weather shortly after its installation. The amplitude of deflection {{at the tip of the}} mast was estimated to be few centimetres and considered unsatisfactory by the owner. A measurement program was initiated to map the vibrations of the mast and to corre-late them with wind data. The recorded data showed that the initiation of the intense vibra-tions as well as the amplitude of the vibrations was in fair agreement with predictions based on theory of bluff body aerodynamics. To reduce the vibrations cylindrical wind flaps were added to the <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> to counteract the formation of vortexes. Comparison of recorded vi-bration data before and after the installation of the wind flaps show that the flaps signifi-cantly reduced the vibration...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} looking into the {{possibilities}} of implementing hybrid street Lightning into the urban infrastructure in Denmark, and the market potential for integrating micro-wind turbines or solar panels into <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> design. Two Danish producer of solar hybrid lamppost, Scotia ApS and Alfred Priess A/S, are used as cases for looking into the industry and for estimating the market potential of the product. The findings are positive towards the technology and the possibilities of integrating the technology into the urban fabric, as <b>light</b> <b>mast</b> have already been introduced into Denmark in 2009. However the potential has not been reached as sales have been waning. But the potential for future growth in the market is argued for,and if political and popular demand is able to push the market demand for hybrid lampposts, the product already exist and the possibilities for growth are huge due to the large amounts of urban light infrastructure already in existence today...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} drivers of demand Naval {{architecture}} changed gradually in the eighteenth century. Of five classes of seventeenth-century vessels, only ship continued to be built after the early 1700s. The others were replaced by four new types: sloop, schooner, brigantine, and snow. Given the constant emigration of shipwrights from England and the limited advances in technology, {{it is not surprising}} that eighteenth-century Americans were usually familiar with trends abroad. Sloop and schooner were more manageable and could operate with fewer men. Smaller sails meant <b>lighter</b> <b>masts</b> and rigging, which in turn reduced expenses for the owners.|$|R
