5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the <b>lustre</b> and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the <b>lustre</b> of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic <b>lustre</b> and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} studies of {{condensed}} states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy, in {{the first decades of}} the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time, twenty-six had metallic properties such as <b>lustre,</b> ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity. This indicated that the atoms in John Dalton's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.|$|E

The p-block metals, and nonmetals (such as carbon or nitrogen) that can form alloys with metals or modify their properties also have occasionally been considered as metalloids.|$|E

5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its <b>lustre</b> can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used to identify}} Bovista pila in the field include its relatively small size, the metallic <b>lustre</b> of the endoperidium, {{and the presence of}} rhizomorphs. B.plumbea is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its typically smaller fruit body and the blue-gray color of its inner coat. Unlike B.pila, B.plumbea is attached to the ground by a mass of mycelial fibers known as a sterile base. Microscopically, B.plumbea has larger spores (5–7 by 4.5–6.0μm); with long pedicels (9–14μm). Another lookalike is the European B.nigrescens, which can most reliably be distinguished from B.pila by its microscopic characteristics. The spores of B.nigrescens are oval rather than spherical, rougher than those of B.pila, and have a hyaline (translucent) pedicel about equal in length to the spore diameter (5μm). The puffball Disciseda pila was named for its external resemblance to B.pila. Found in Texas and Argentina, it has much larger, warted spores that measure 7.9–9.4μm.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic <b>lustre,</b> but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E

Iran) between c 10, 000 and 5000 bc, though subsequent developments are also summarized. Chapter I summarizes the history of research and outlines the issues involved. Chapter II is concerned with the environmental and cultural background against which <b>lustred</b> blades are evaluated. Evidence for function is dealt with in Chapter III. Various sources provide information, including contemporary (though rather late) written and iconographic sources, ethnographic parallels, experimental replication and functional analysis of the blades. Chapter IV summarizes the quite considerable body of evidence for hafting and over 70 hafts are described in detail in Appendix II, Chapters V and VI concentrate on the change of form of <b>lustred</b> blades. The methodology of the analysis of the blades is outlined at the beginning of Chapter V and a sample of <b>lustred</b> blades from Jericho is used as a case study. In Chapter VI <b>lustred</b> blades from a number of sites in different environments are considered in detail and discussed against the cultural background outlined in Chapter II. together with contemporary evidence for hafting and function. Chapter VII is a summary of the results and concludes that illustred blades, when considered in a wider context, have a potential importance for the reconstruction of past economies.

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic <b>lustre,</b> semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for caesium, {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their <b>lustre</b> tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt {{and three months}} later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of supply shortages and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation <b>Lustre.</b> The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E
40|$|The {{area between}} the Golo and Tavignano valleys (Central Corsica) {{provides}} {{a good opportunity to}} study the relationships between the Hercynian Corsica, the Corte Slices (i. e. Lower Units) and the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> Complex (Di Rosa et al., 2017). The Hercynian Corsica consists of a paleozoic basement (Roches Brunes Fm. intruded by Permo-Carboniferous monzogranites) covered by Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary successions. Despite the occurrence of several shear zones of Tertiary age, the Hercynian Corsica is considered a domain not involved in the Alpine Orogeny. The Corte Slices and the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> Complex, that belong to the Alpine Corsica, are the remains of the oceanic crust and the European continental margin, both involved in the E-dipping oceanic and continental subduction (Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary). The subduction was associated by an exhumation whose end is regarded as pre-Burdigalian in age (Malasoma & Marroni 2007). In the study area the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> Complex is represented by metaserpentinites, metagabbros, metabasalts and calc-schists, whereas the Corte Slices consist of three tectonic units similar in their lithostratigraphy (i. e. Paleozoic basement covered by Mesozoic to Tertiary metasediments) but different in the metamorphic degree. The structural setting of the Alpine Units is characterized by a polyphased deformation history: within the Corte Slices, three phases are recognized at all the scale of observation (D 1 -D 3). The D 1 produces F 1 sheath folds and a S 1 foliation, almost completely transposed by the D 2 phase, characterized by F 2 isoclinal folds with a subvertical axial plane foliation, a S 2 and a L 2 stretching lineation. The D 3 is associated to F 3 folds with a subhorizontal axial plane foliation. A post-D 3 brittle deformation phase is associated to the Central Corsica Shear Zone, a strike-slip faults system that cuts all the previous structures. The Schistes <b>Lustrès</b> Complex shows a higher grade of deformation, acquired within the accretionary wedge during the oceanic subduction. However, the Schistes <b>Lustrès</b> Complex is folded by the same structures of the D 3 phase recognized in the Corte Slices, that deform the previous phases within the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> Complex as well as the tectonic contacts between it and the continental units. The occurrence of the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> Complex as slices sandwiched between the Corte Slices, suggests an interaction between these two groups during the coupling of the continental units, i. e. in a pre-D 3 phase...|$|R
40|$|The East Tenda Shear Zone (ETSZ) is {{the major}} Alpine tectonic {{boundary}} marking the overthrusting of the oceanicderived Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> nappe onto the Hercynian crystalline basement of western Corsica. In this work we present new structural and geochemical investigations along a transect ranging from the undeformed protolith (PR) to the contact with the Schistes <b>Lustrés.</b> The results are used to construct a rheological model for the ETSZ. Shear deformation within the ETSZ is heterogeneously distributed with high-strain domains (shear zones, SZ) wrapping sigmoid shaped low-strain domains (massive lenses, ML). Locally, mica-rich mylonites occur (phyllonites). The main foliation is concordant with that in the overlying Schistes <b>Lustrés,</b> strikes NW-SE, and is dominantly shallow-dipping to NE. The ML mineralogy consists of an assemblage made of quartz, phengite and (relict) feldspar (epidote, Fe-oxides, zircon and allanite as accessory phases).

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic <b>lustre</b> and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

40|$|International audienceKnowledge {{of the age}} {{and timing}} of {{ophiolite}} sequences is essential for understanding the mechanisms of plate tectonics. The ophiolites in the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> and the Upper nappes of Alpine Corsica represent remnants of the Liguria-Piemonte ocean basin that formed as {{a branch of the}} Central Atlantic basin during the opening of the Mesozoic Western Alpine Tethys. Despite numerous isotopic and paleontological studies, the age and timing of the ophiolites in the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> nappe are still controversial. This study presents integrated in situ analyses of zircon U-Pb age and O-Hf isotopic data for ophiolitic gabbros and plagiogranites from three localities in the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> nappe of Eastern Corsica. Our new results demonstrate that these rocks crystallized synchronously at ~ 159 Ma, approximately 10 m. y. younger than the ophiolites in the Balagne Upper nappe. Zircons from the gabbros and plagiogranites are characterized by highly positive εHf(t) (+ 15. 0 to + 15. 9) and mantle-like δ 18 O (5. 2 - 5. 4 ‰) values. Thus, these ophiolitic rocks were cogenetic, and crystallized from magmas produced by partial melting of a depleted, N-MORB type mantle. By contrast, in the Balagne Upper nappe, the ~ 169 Ma ophiolites contain numerous xenocrystic zircons inherited from a continental crust. Our current knowledge of isotopic geochronology and geochemistry supports a paleogeographic reconstruction, in which the earliest ophiolites in the Balagne nappe were emplaced close to a continental margin at ~ 169 Ma, whilst the N-MORB type ophiolites in the Schistes <b>Lustrés</b> nappe were likely formed approximately 10 m. y. later in {{the central part of the}} Liguria-Piemonte oceanic basin.
