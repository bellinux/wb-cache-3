These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|The tale of Revanta's {{birth is}} narrated in scriptures like Vishnu Purana and Markandeya Purana. Once, Sanjna, the {{daughter}} of celestial architect Vishvakarma and wife of Surya, unable to take the fervour of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities {{in the form of}} a mare. She placed her shadow Chhaya, who <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-Ashvins and Revanta. In Kurma Purana and Matsya Purana, the mother of Revanta is named Rajni, another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of Markandeya Purana, he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god Shani and Savarni Manu.|$|E

500|$|A second {{version of}} the video (known as the Sugar Lumps version), which adds the Sugar Lumps—a satirical {{version of the}} Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu, and Jennifer Saunders—was filmed for the [...] "Red Nose Day" [...] of the 1997 Comic Relief, {{one of the two}} {{high-profile}} telethon events held in the United Kingdom. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> me and everyone said they thought she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{fortress}} at Tuyen Quang {{was typical}} of the small, remote outposts of France’s colonial empire. [...] Lying on the western bank of the Clear River next to the Tonkinese village of Tuyen Quang, it consisted of a square masonry citadel, each of whose walls was 300 yards long. [...] Inside the citadel’s perimeter were several barrack buildings, a lake and a large earthen mound {{in the shape of a}} sugar loaf. [...] This hill, which <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a natural formation, took the place at Tuyen Quang of the tower traditionally found in Tonkinese citadels.|$|E
2500|$|The look of {{the film}} was {{achieved}} through the work of cinematographer John F. Seitz. At the time, Seitz was the premiere director of photography on the Paramount lot; his work extended {{all the way back}} to the silent era. Wilder had worked with Seitz on his previous film, Five Graves to Cairo, in which Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award and Wilder praised Seitz's willingness to experiment and fail. Here Wilder taps into his 1920s Berlin roots, and he and Seitz give the film a look subtly reminiscent of German expressionism, with dramatic deployment of light and shadows. [...] "He was ready for anything," [...] Wilder said. [...] "Sometimes the rushes were so dark that you couldn't see anything. He went to the limits of what could be done." [...] They would contrast the bright sunny Southern California exteriors, shot on location, with dark, gloomy, rotten interiors shot on soundstages to give the audience a sense of what lurks just beneath the facade – and just who is capable of murder. The contrast was heightened, in Wilder's words, by [...] "dirtying up" [...] the sets. Once the set was ready for filming, Wilder would go around and overturn a few ashtrays to give the house an appropriately grubby look. [...] Wilder and Seitz also blew aluminum particles into the air so that, as they floated down, they <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> dust.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fashion and}} {{wardrobe}} during the shows received praise from critics. Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press praised the little designs noting {{that they were}} suitable for films and compared them with something fashion designer Bob Mackie might have designed for a space movie in the 1970s. Alice Jones of The Independent noted that the [...] "extraordinary" [...] ensemble which Knowles wears during {{the opening of the}} show is [...] "topped off by the most enormous gold-sequined bow on her ever-undulating booty". She further noted that Knowles' alter ego <b>looked</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> her only with more make-up and noted, [...] " [...] 30 songs introduces us to any number of different Beyoncés – showgirl, balladeer, feminist, rock chick, gangster queen, cyborg – via off-stage costume changes and a leotard for every mood, including one which looks like the front end of a Harley-Davidson, complete with flashing headlamps." [...] Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph noted that the shows featured [...] "some of the most elaborate and revealing costumes of her career" [...] and further described the corsets as [...] "jaw-dropping". [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail commented that the number of costume changes during the show [...] "only added to the magic of the evening". Donna MCconnel of the same publication noted that a [...] "dramatic" [...] gold jewelled metal corset with built-in curve worn during the concerts drew [...] "even more attention to her famous figure". Another writer of Daily Mail wrote that Knowles' outfits [...] "became increasingly outlandish – part Roman goddess, part WWF wrestler". A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote, [...] "Her costumes were as sparkling as her personality. From NYPD cop to bride to Wonderwoman and beyond, the outfits showed off every inch of her perfectly toned body." [...] Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph also praised the fashion writing that the wardrobe included [...] "one incredible costume after another _ from a Mad Max look that would have had Mel Gibson on his knees, to an angelic wedding dress for a rendition of Ave Maria guaranteed to have raised the sails of the Sydney Opera House." [...] Simon Collins of The West Australian described the costumes as [...] "sexy". Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times noted that Knowles looked like a [...] "goddess" [...] in the [...] "array of spectacular outfits" [...] further praising the crystal encrusted black corset she wore during the performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] describing her look as [...] "dazzling". Jim Farber from the New York Daily News wrote, [...] "The costumes didn't disappoint, including one getup that looked like Barbarella on a safari and another that depicted Beyoncé as an unlikely innocent in white." ...|$|E
