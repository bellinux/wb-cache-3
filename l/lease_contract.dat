5|$|Toll {{rates are}} set {{by both the}} 407ETR and the Province of Ontario {{for each of the}} {{respective}} sections they own. However, the province set out limitations in the 407 ETR <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> for maintaining traffic volumes to justify toll rates. Despite this, rates have increased annually against the requests of the provincial government, resulting in several court battles and the general public regarding the route as a luxury.|$|E
5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 {{it was in the}} process of negotiating a 10-year <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.|$|E
5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} <b>lease</b> <b>contract.</b> On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E

DAWASCO operates under a 10-year <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> with DAWASA that is almost identical to the <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> that DAWASA had signed with a foreign private company in 2003 as part of a failed privatization attempt.

40|$|The present thesis {{analyzes}} the statutory regulation of leasing transactions in the Czech Republic, {{both from the}} perspective of the general legislation and {{from the perspective of}} the tax laws. Since operating and finance <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> are not classified under nominate (named) contracts in the Czech Civil or the Commercial Codes, the principal legal aspects of this commercial arrangement have been established largely by way of evolving judicial and business practice. The absence of the general legal regulation, particularly with respect to finance leases, has also had some important consequences for tax laws and their application. The thesis also describes the distinguishing features of finance leases compared to the general <b>lease</b> <b>contracts.</b> A thoughtful statutory regulation of leasing transactions would therefore bring about the much-needed legal certainty for all parties involved in and affected by <b>lease</b> <b>contracts.</b> The present thesis sets out both a thorough description of the current state of law with respect to <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> and puts forwards proposals on how to improve the enactments of law in future...|$|R

The PPP covered those areas of the capital and of four other cities that had access to formal water supply systems. However, the PPP ended when the management contracts for four cities expired in 2008 and when the foreign partner of the company that serves the capital under a <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> withdrew in 2010, claiming heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|After the {{two large}} freight ships were {{completed}} the workload went down. There were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock. In 1923 the company got two notable projects: {{one of them}} was a minor repair project of a shipwrecked merchant ship. The other one was for completing a semi-finished icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year-round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and handed over to the state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.|$|E
40|$|A {{monopolist}} {{selling a}} durable good cannot extract the whole amount of monopoly rents from consumers each period. This inefficiency {{is due to}} the incompleteness of contracts: The monopolist cannot credibly commit not to lower the price in future periods. By using <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> however the monopolist can solve this credibility problem, but then he is exposed to inefficiencies due to moral hazard. This leads many authors in the Durable Goods Literature to rule out <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts.</b> This paper's contribution is to show the invalidity of the moral hazard argument by using <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> that include an option to buy the good. The kind of contract we propose has neither been considered in the durable goods literature, nor in the Incomplete Contracts Approach so far...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the pricing of point-to-point bandwidth <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> and options. The underlying asset of these contracts is a point-to-point telecommunications connection. Due to the network structure the network capacity prices depend nonlinearly on each other. A <b>leasing</b> <b>contract</b> on a point-to-point connection {{can be seen as}} an option because the seller of the connection selects the cheapest path between the points. Therefore, a bandwidth option is a compound option...|$|R
40|$|<b>Leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> are {{extensively}} used in {{durable goods}} markets. These contracts specify a rental rate and an option price {{at which the}} used good can be bought on termination of the lease. This option price cannot be controlled when the car is sold. We show that {{in a world in}} which quality is observable, this additional control variable is ineffective. Under adverse selection instead, <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> affect equilibrium allocations in a way that matches observed behavior in the car market. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that leased cars have a higher turnover and that off-lease used cars are of higher quality. Moreover, the model predicts that the recent increase in leasing can be explained by the observed increase in car durability. We show that <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> can improve welfare but that they are imperfect tools. We also show that a producer with market power can benefit from <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> for two reasons: market segmentation and better pricing of the option. Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection, we show that this is not in their interest. ...|$|R
25|$|Private sector participation. The {{private sector}} plays a limited, albeit {{recently}} increasing role in operating and maintaining urban water systems {{on behalf of}} ULBs. For example, the Jamshedpur Utilities & Services Company (Jusco), a subsidiary of Tata Steel, has a <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> for Jamshedpur (Jharkhand), a management contract in Haldia (West Bengal), another contract in Mysore (Karnataka) and since 2007 a contract for the reduction of non-revenue water in parts of Bhopal (Madhya Pradhesh). The French water company Veolia won a management contract in three cities in Karnataka in 2005. In 2002 a consortium including Thames Water won a pilot contract covering 40,000 households to reduce non-revenue water in parts of Bangalore, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The contract was scaled up in 2004. The Cypriot company Hydro-Comp, with two Indian companies, won a 10-year concession contract {{for the city of}} Latur City (Maharashtra) in 2007 and an operator-consultant contract in Madurai (Tamil Nadu). Furthermore, the private Indian infrastructure development company SPML is engaged in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, such as a bulk water supply project for Bhiwandi (Maharashtra).|$|E

In contrast, under adverse selection, <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> affect equilibrium allocations {{in a way that}} matches observed behavior in the car market. We show that a social planner can use <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> to improve welfare but they are imperfect tools; they cannot generally achieve first best while other mechanisms can.

Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection (by raising the option price so high that no lessee keeps the used good) we show that this is not in their interest; a keeping option will always be included in some contracts. ...|$|R
