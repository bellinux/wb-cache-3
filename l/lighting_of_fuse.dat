50|$|Part of each episode's title {{sequence}} {{was highly}} unusual, {{as it was}} composed {{of a number of}} very short clips of key scenes from the subject episode. This was, and remains, very rare for series television. However, it was already being done as of the previous season on I Spy, which like Mission had the <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fuse</b> leading to it. The hand with the match was, until sometime in the sixth season, that of creator Bruce Geller; in the revival series, the hand belonged to Peter Graves, who was shown holding the match. Several British teleseries produced by Gerry Anderson and his then wife Sylvia Anderson, the contemporaneous Thunderbirds (made in 1964) and the mid-1970s Space: 1999 (which starred Mission: Impossible alumni Martin Landau and Barbara Bain) amongst them, also showed clips in the opening sequence. The reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV series also used this device. The clips in the opening sequence were chosen to showcase dramatic moments in the upcoming mission, such as moments of surprise, moments of violence, or equipment in use. In particular, the first clip shown was often someone getting punched and/or knocked out. For the first two seasons, the closing credits showed clips from that mission in freeze frame. At the start of 1968, when Paramount took over from Desilu, the same clips were shown during the closing credits across episodes; later seasons eschewed that approach, featuring a freeze frame <b>of</b> the hand <b>lighting</b> the fuse.|$|R

40|$|Background] Despite the {{importance}} of light-ion fusion in nucleosynthesis, {{a limited amount of}} data exists regarding the de-excitation following fusion for such systems. [Purpose] To explore the characteristics of alpha emission associated with the decay <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>fused</b> systems at low excitation energy. [Method] Alpha particles were detected in coincidence with evaporation residues (ER) formed by the fusion of 18 O and 12 C nuclei. Both alpha particles and ERs were identified {{on the basis of their}} energy and time-of-flight. ERs were characterized by their energy spectra and angular distributions while the alpha particles were characterized by their energy spectra, angular distributions, and cross-sections. [Results] While the energy spectra and angular distributions for the alpha particles are well reproduced by statistical model codes, the measured cross-section is substantially underpredicted by the models. Comparison with similar systems reveals that the fundamental quantity for the alpha cross-section is Ec. m. and not the excitation energy <b>of</b> the <b>fused</b> system. [Conclusion]The enhancement in the measured alpha cross-section as compared to the statistical model codes and its dependence with Ec. m. suggest that a coupling between pre-existing alpha cluster structure and the collision dynamics is responsible for the observed alpha cross-section.

60|$|Every form {{of memory}} will be, from our present point of view, {{in one sense}} a delayed response. But this phrase does not quite clearly express what is meant. If you light a fuse and connect it with a heap of dynamite, the {{explosion}} of the dynamite may be spoken of, in a sense, as a delayed response to your <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fuse.</b> But that only means that it is a somewhat late portion of a continuous process of which the earlier parts have less emotional interest. This is not the case with habit. A display of habit has two sorts of causes: (a) the past occurrences which generated the habit, (b) the present occurrence which brings it into play. When you drop a weight on your toe, and say what you do say, the habit has been caused by imitation of your undesirable associates, whereas it is brought into play by the dropping of the weight. The great bulk of our knowledge is a habit in this sense: whenever I am asked when I was born, I reply correctly by mere habit. It would hardly be correct to say that getting born was the stimulus, and that my reply is a delayed response But in cases of memory this way of speaking would have an element of truth. In an habitual memory, the event remembered was clearly {{an essential part of the}} stimulus to the formation of the habit. The present stimulus which brings the habit into play produces a different response from that which it would produce if the habit did not exist. Therefore the habit enters into the causation of the response, and so do, at one remove, the causes of the habit. It follows that an event remembered is an essential part of the causes of our remembering.|$|R
