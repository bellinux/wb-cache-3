Bioavailability was indicated by gene expression in larval zebrafish. Both Phe and EE 2 sorbed to MPs, which reduced bioavailability by a maximum of 33 % and 48 % respectively. Sorption occurred, but was not consistent with predictions based on co-contaminant physicochemistry (Phe having higher <b>log</b> 10 <b>Kow</b> was expected to have higher sorption). Contaminated MPs settled {{to the bottom of}} the exposures did not lead to increased bioavailability of Phe or EE 2.

The resulting log KOC's for both in situ and added compounds are rather high compared to literature data (up to 9. 3 for benzo[ghi]perylene), with the ones in the recently deposited layer being generally higher than those in the aged layer (up to 1. 6 log units). The results do not show the well-established effects due to increased contact time of contaminants with sediments (i. e. "aging" or "slow sorption") and indicate that after only short equilibrium times (11 days) KOC's can even be higher than after several decades of contact time in the field. In addition, distribution coefficients show a remarkable dependence on sorbate planarity, manifested by significantly different <b>log</b> KOC-log <b>KOW</b> relationships for planar (chlorobenzenes, PAHs, and mono-ortho-substituted PCBs) and nonplanar (multiple-ortho-substituted PCBs) contaminants in both sediment layers.

In addition to the aqueous-phase removal efficiency (Φ), they can inform on chemical partitioning, transformation, and persistence, {{as well as on}} the chemical loading to streams and soils receiving, respectively, treated effluent and digested sewage sludge (biosolids). Release rates computed on a per-capita basis can serve to extrapolate findings to a larger scale. This review examines over a dozen mass balances conducted for various organic wastewater contaminants, including prescription drugs, estrogens, fragrances, antimicrobials, and surfactants of differing sorption potential (hydrophobicity), here expressed as the 1 -octanol−water partition coefficient (KOW) and the organic carbon normalized sorption coefficient (KOC). Major challenges to mass balances are the collection of representative samples and accurate quantification of chemicals in sludge. A meta-analysis of peer-reviewed data identified sorption potential as the principal determinant governing chemical persistence in biosolids. Occurrence data for organic wastewater compounds detected in digested sludge followed a simple nonlinear model that required only KOW or KOC as the input and yielded a correlation coefficient of 0. 9 in both instances. The model predicted persistence in biosolids for the majority (> 50 %) of the input load of organic wastewater compounds featuring a <b>log</b> 10 <b>KOW</b> value of greater than 5. 2 (log 10 KOC > 4. 4).

40|$|Passive sampling, {{as opposed}} to the {{conventional}} spot or bottle water sampling technique, has shown to be reliable and efficient in monitoring the toxicologically relevant, freely dissolved (e. g. bioavaialable) concentrations {{of a wide range of}} organic contaminants in water. At the same time, partitioning controlled delivery (passive dosing; PD) techniques promise to overcome many of the challenges associated with toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances that may bias the interpretation of toxicity data. The present study investigated the feasibility of coupling silicone rubber passive sampling devices (SR-PSDs) with bioassay techniques for both chemical and ecotoxicological assessment of complex mixtures of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. SR-PSDs were deployed in water at various locations within the Ythan catchment (north east, Scotland, UK), Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth (east coast of central Scotland, UK) for 7 to 9 weeks. Following retrieval, extracts from the SR-PSDs were analysed for dissolved concentrations of a variety of organic contaminants including PAHs and PCBs using GC-MS and GC-ECD respectively and were screened for a wide range of pesticides using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The extracts were further evaluated for acute cytotoxicity (i. e. neutral red uptake assay) and EROD induction potential using rainbow trout liver cell line (Oncorhynchus mykiss; RTL-W 1) and for phytotoxicity and developmental toxicity potential using algal growth inhibition test (with a marine phytoplankton, Diacronema lutheri) and fish embryo toxicity test (with embryos from zebrafish Danio rerio) respectively. Overall, the individual and total dissolved concentrations of PAHs (ΣPAH 40; parent and branched) and PCBs (ΣPCB 32; ortho and mono-ortho) measured in water from the Ythan, Forth estuary and Firth of Forth were relatively low compared with other studies using PSDs. A number and level of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides of varying hydrophobicity (<b>log</b> <b>KOWs</b> ~ 2. 25 to ~ 5. 31) were detected in the silicone rubber (SR) extracts from the Ythan catchment, the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth, suggesting input mainly from agricultural run-off and possibly from direct discharges. No statistically significant (p< 0. 05) acute cytotoxicity was observed following 48 h exposure of RTL-W 1 cells to SR extracts from the Ythan catchment. But, on a sublethal level, for every site, statistically significant EROD activity was observed to some degree following 72 h exposure. In addition, developmental and algal toxicities on embryos of D. rerio and D. lutheri respectively, were measured in all the deployed samples compared with the procedural controls (undeployed samples). Interestingly, extracts of SR-PSDs from the Forth estuary and the Firth of Forth exhibited growth inhibitions on D. lutheri that were similar to those of extracts from the Ythan, even though, fewer numbers of pesticides were detected in the Forth estuary and Firth of Forth than the Ythan. This suggests that pesticides were not solely responsible for the observed effects in the Ythan catchment. To further improve data from toxicity testing of hydrophobic substances, the study identified the use of SR O-rings as a suitable passive dosing format in in vitro toxicity tests and was partially validated through their use in dosing RTL-W 1 cells with two individual PAHs and subsequently determining cytotoxicity and EROD-activity.

Passive sampling measurements give freely dissolved porewater concentrations (C-pw,C-free), while leaching tests provide information on the mobile concentration (C-pw,C-leach), including contaminants associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particles/colloids in the porewater. This study presents a novel combination of these two measurements, to study the sorption and mobility of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) to DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) in 10 historically contaminated soils. The PACs investigated were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated-PAHs, and nitrogen containing heterocyclic PACs. Observed C-pw,C-leach was up to 5 orders of magnitude higher than C-pw,C-free; implying large biases when C-pw,C-leach is used to assess bioavailability or soil partitioning. Sorption of PACs to DOC and POC was important for the mobility of compounds with log K-OW > 4. Average DOC/water-partitioning coefficients (K-DOC) correlated well with <b>KOW</b> (<b>log</b> K-DOC = 0. 89 x log K-OW + 1. 03 (r(2) = 0. 89)). This relationship is likely more accurate for historically contaminated soils than previously published data, which suffer from artifacts caused by problems in measuring C-pw,C-free correctly or not using historically contaminated soils. POC/water-partitioning coefficients (K-POC) were orders of magnitude larger than corresponding K-DOC, suggesting sorption to mobile particles/colloids is the dominant mechanism for PAC mobility...|$|R

With the exception of dl-PCB and DBDPE at one Saarland site, contamination was not very pronounced at investigated conurbation areas. Given that quantified concentrations of some compounds were close to the respective MQLs and that MQLs, thus, had a strong influence on the compositions, substance class profiles were quite similar between the samples and indicated rather diffuse sources.

50|$|There {{are many}} types of passive {{samplers}} used that specialize in absorbing different classes of aquatic contaminants found in the environment. Chemcatcher and SMPD {{are two types of}} passive samplers that are also commonly used. Monitoring programs use SMPDs to measure to hydrophobic organic contaminants. SPMDs are designed to mimic the bioconcentration of contaminants in fatty tissues (ITRC, 2006). Contaminants applicable to the use of an SPMD include, but are not limited to, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins, and furans. The SPMD consist of a thin-walled, nonporous, polyethylene membrane tube that is filled with high molecular weight lipid. These tubes are approximately 90 cm long and wrap around the inside of a stainless steel deployment canister. SMPDs are efficient at absorbing pollutants with a <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> of 4-8. This slightly overlaps with the range of contaminants absorbed by POCIS. Because of this, SMPDs and POCIS devices are often used together in monitoring studies to achieve a more representative understanding of contamination.|$|E
5000|$|The first passive {{sampling}} devices {{were developed in}} the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air. In 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water. The initial type of passive sampler developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device (SMPD). SPMD samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient (Kow) ranging from 4-8. As the global emission of bioconcentratable persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was shown to result in adverse ecological effects, industry developed {{a wide range of}} increasing water-soluble, polar hydrophilic organic compounds (HpOCs) to replace them. These compounds generally have lower bioconcentration factors. However, there is evidence that large fluxes of these HpOCs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms, such as altered behavior, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and impaired reproduction. In the late 1990s research was underway to develop a new passive sampler in order to monitor HpOCs with a <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> value of less than 3. [...] In 1999 the POCIS sampler was under development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. It gathered more support in the early 2000s as concern increased regarding the effects of pharmaceutical and personal care products in surface waters. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been heavily involved in the development of passive samplers and has articles in their database regarding the development of POCIS as early as 2000. The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a self-proclaimed international leader in the field of {{passive sampling}}. There have been recent efforts by the USGS to connect people who have an interest in passive sampling.

Surfactants can even emulsify the n-octanol–water system, making the measurement of <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> a technical challenge. For this reason, the traditional ‘shake-flask’ method (OECD 107 Test Guideline) [1] is no longer considered appropriate for <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> determination of surfactants.|$|E
30|$|Log Kow/D data {{calculated}} using the HPLC method, slow-stirring method, solubility ratio approach or predictive software {{are generally not}} in agreement when assessing the 12 test compounds, though non-ionic <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> values were rather more consistent than the other three classes of surfactants. Of the experimental techniques, the slow-stirring method {{is considered to be}} the most widely applicable method for generating <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> data for all the surface-active test compounds, provided it can be demonstrated that the ‘surfactant’–‘water’–‘n-octanol’ system was allowed to reach equilibrium. This is supported by good agreement in slow-stirring <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> data for C 8 EO 4 and C 12 EO 8 generated in the current study and earlier work [40]. It is possible by minimising micelle formation, emulsification and adsorption effects [45, 46] to obtain reasonably reliable <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> values for surface-active molecules using a slow-stirring method. Corrections to apparent <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> data can be made if the concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium is above the CMC. The main limitation of the slow-stirring method from the current study is that it requires sensitive analytical methods (e.g. liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry; LC–MS) for analysis of the water phase for the more hydrophobic test compounds.|$|E
30|$|The bio{{concentration}} factor (BCF) {{is defined as}} the ratio of concentration in fish to the concentration in the surrounding medium. It is generally derived experimentally according to OECD Test Guideline 305 I (bioconcentration flow-through fish test [33]). This test is appropriate for substances with moderate hydrophobicity, so it is necessary to determine the concentration of the test substance in the exposure medium and in fish. The test is mandatory for risk assessment for PPPs, biocides and human medicinal products if <b>log</b> <b>KOW</b> exceeds 3, and for veterinary pharmaceuticals if <b>log</b> <b>KOW</b> exceeds 4. It is also required for REACH substances with a production volume above 100  t/a and a <b>log</b> <b>KOW</b> > 3.|$|E
40|$|Polar organic {{chemical}} integrative samplers (POCIS) have previously {{been used to}} monitor alkylphenol (AP) contamination in water and produced water. However, only the sorbent receiving phase of the POCIS (Oasis beads) is traditionally analyzed, thus limiting the use of POCIS for monitoring a range of APs with varying hydrophobicity. Here a "pharmaceutical" POCIS was calibrated in the laboratory using a static renewal setup for APs (from 2 -ethylphenol to 4 -n-nonylphenol) with varying hydrophobicity (<b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> between 2. 47 and 5. 76). The POCIS sampler was calibrated over its 28 day integrative regime and sampling rates (Rs) were determined. Uptake was {{shown to be a}} function of AP hydrophobicity where compounds with <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> 5 were preferentially accumulated in the PES membranes. A lag phase (over a 24 h period) before uptake in to the PES membranes occurred was evident. This work demonstrates that the analysis of both POCIS phases is vital in order to correctly determine environmentally relevant concentrations owing to the fact that for APs with <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> ≤ 4 uptake, to the PES membranes and the Oasis beads, involves different processes compared to APs with <b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> ≥ 4. The extraction of both the POCIS matrices is thus recommended in order to assess the concentration of hydrophobic APs (<b>log</b> <b>Kow</b> ≥ 4), as well as hydrophilic APs, most effectively...|$|E
