500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

They've put violence on screen before, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but not like this. Not anything like this. No Country for Old Men doesn't celebrate or smile at violence; it despairs of it." [...] However, Turan explained that [...] "no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy {{are not interested in}} violence for its own sake, but for what it says about {{the world we live in}} ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined. And in this despairing vision, neither does anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate thing I noticed was the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability I doubt it very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|E
