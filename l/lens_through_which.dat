As <b>lenses</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> disputants interpret conflicts, divergent frames limit the clarity of communication and the quality of information and encourage escalation.

2500|$|Womanist theory, while diverse, holds at {{its core}} that that both {{femininity}} and culture are equally {{as important to the}} woman’s existence. In this conception one’s femininity cannot be stripped from the culture that it exists within. At first glance, this seems similar to the thought process of third wave feminism, which embraced the concept of intersectionality. The difference lies in the valuation placed on intersectionality within the theoretical frameworks. Womanism espouses the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her femininity, but rather is the <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> femininity exists. As such, a woman’s Blackness is not a component of her feminism; instead, her Blackness is the <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> she understands her femininity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the long-running}} BBC {{television}} science fiction programme Doctor Who and related works, the term [...] "companion" [...] {{refers to a}} character who travels with, or shares the adventures of the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions and getting into trouble, or by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. Until the modern revival of the series in 2005, the term was rarely used on-screen. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as his [...] "friends" [...] or [...] "assistants"; the British press have also used the latter term.|$|E

UKIP characterises the EU as a fundamentally undemocratic institution and stresses the need to regain what it describes as the UK's national sovereignty from the EU.

2500|$|A key {{concept of}} The Glass Bees is {{illustrated}} through the novel’s {{focus on the}} minuscule. Demonstrated both by {{the structure of the}} narrative and through Zapparoni’s forays into nanotechnology, it is seen that it is the minute that has the most meaning and influence in life, not the grand or conspicuous. Zapparoni’s tiny creations are the first <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> Jünger plays with the theme of miniaturization - the title itself refers to one such creation. [...] The glass bees exemplify how it is the overlooked that often possesses the greatest meaning. At first an unappreciated aspect of Zapparoni’s garden, Richard eventually notices the intricacy and difficulty of creating something so small: “In the beginning, probably it was less difficult to create a whale than a hummingbird,” and comes to acknowledge that {{the true nature of the}} garden is “more significant than it had seemed to me in my first consternation.” As such, the garden acts as a microcosm of the novel’s world: only upon reflection does the true nature and relevance of the overlooked become apparent.|$|E

2500|$|Tosh’s overall {{assessment}} {{is that a}} shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic back {{to the history of}} masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians {{to live up to the}} [...] "social expectation" [...] of their work, which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an [...] "outflanking movement" [...] towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study. This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the Low Countries, Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> to view conflict and nation-building). Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because [...] "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.|$|E

Each of the 15 lithographs features a photograph of the surface of the River Thames that has been annotated with many small white numerals that correspond to a bar of footnotes that runs along the lower border of each image. In one footnote, Horn puts a fine point on the <b>lens</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> this project looks at the river, [...] "(41) The Thames has the highest rate of suicides of any urban river. Maybe it's not the highest but it's close. It doesn't really matter because even if it doesn't, it looks like it does." [...] Horn describes these annotations as footnoting [...] "whatever I was thinking of at the time, what the river provoked in me, and what was in the river itself." [...] The result is a mixture of poetic fragments, reports culled from interviews and newspaper clippings about deaths (primarily planned suicides) by drowning in the Thames, references to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, questions about identity and consideration of the subject of water from many different perspectives. In most cases, the photographs were taken with such exactitude that the moving surface of the water is stopped in highly detailed topographies, so that the substance of water is shown in more sculptural views than can usually be observed by the naked eye.|$|E
