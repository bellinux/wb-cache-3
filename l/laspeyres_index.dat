For three German price statistics, disaggregate official data are analysed. Generalised means of price relatives are systematically calculated and plugged into the aggregate formula. The results point to widely different estimates between <b>Laspeyres</b> price <b>indices</b> based on the alternative elementary indices. There is a “price ” to be paid at the upper level for suboptimal index formula selection at the lower level.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} manufacturing {{energy use}} due in 10 IEA countries between 1973 and 1998. Changes in energy use are described through using <b>Laspeyres</b> <b>indexes</b> {{to enable the}} decomposition of energy use into changes in the overall output of manufacturing (i. e. value added), the structure of output (industrial mix), and the energy intensity of each sub-sector, and to consistently compare the results across countries. The results show that structural changes have reduced manufacturing energy-use in most countries, particularly the US and Japan. In a few countries, however, the manufacturing structure became more energy-intensive and thus drove up energy use over the study period. For the group of 10 IEA nations, {{the net effect of}} structural changes accounted for {{more than a third of}} the reduction in total manufacturing energy use per unit of output between 1973 and 1998. The rest of the reductions in this period can be explained by falling energy-intensities in individual manufacturing branches. Contrasting post- 1986 with earlier years shows that the rate of energy-intensity decline in manufacturing has slowed in most countries. Between 1994 and 1998 most countries experienced a strong growth in manufacturing output and a reduction in aggregated manufacturing energy use per unit output. However, the results of the decomposition analysis presented in this paper point to this reduction being mostly due to a structural shift towards less energy-intensive branches, such as electronics and electronic equipment, and that the impact from reduced energy-intensities was close to nil for the group of 10 IEA countries studied here.

40|$|This paper {{questions}} the alleged superiority of superlative prices indices (like the Fisher index) over more standard base year <b>indices</b> (like the <b>Laspeyre</b> <b>index)</b> as measures {{of changes in}} the 2 ̆ 7 cost of living 2 ̆ 7 (COL). The primary basis of our challenge is the 2 ̆ 7 subjective 2 ̆ 7 concept of welfare favoured by neo-classical economists. As shown by our results, a subjective welfare approach is relatively disadvantageous to those exhibiting more flexible preferences. Given that flexible behaviour could be a characteristic of the more income constrained and the not unreasonable possibility that preferences are income determined, the neo-classical COL approach is problematic in its axiomatic foundations, in its informational requirements and from an equity perspective. By contrast, with base year indices we objectively know what it is we are measuring. This is consistent with the defence by Sen (1985) and others of objective measures of welfare, which are also more conducive to progressive social policy than are subjective utility measures...|$|R

40|$|The 1993 SNA {{recommends}} chain volume indices over traditional {{fixed base}} indices {{as the principal}} measure of year-to-year volume movements in economic aggregates. Recognising, however, that "addi-tive consistency " is important to many users, the SNA recommends that countries continue to compile traditional constant price data alongside the chain indices.
