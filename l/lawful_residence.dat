2500|$|Fourth, {{and more}} debated, article 24 {{requires}} that the longer an EU citizen stays in a host state, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services, {{on the basis of}} equal treatment. This reflects general principles of equal treatment and citizenship in TFEU articles 18 and 20. In a simple case, in Sala v Freistaat Bayern the Court of Justice held that a Spanish lady who had lived in Germany for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to child support, without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one. In Trojani v Centre public d'aide sociale de Bruxelles, a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the [...] "minimex" [...] allowance from the state for a minimum living wage. In Grzelczyk v Centre Public d'Aide Sociale d'Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the [...] "minimex" [...] income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing the Court of Justice held that it was lawful to require a French UCL economics student lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional [...] "settled status". Similarly, in Commission v Austria, Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid [...] "structural, staffing and financial problems" [...] if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem. However, in Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig, the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny child support to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of [...] "sufficient resources", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on <b>lawful</b> <b>residence</b> under article 7.|$|E

50|$|On {{the first}} {{question}} regarding the condition of prior <b>lawful</b> <b>residence</b> in another member state, the Court noted {{in the first place}} that no provision of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 makes its application conditional on prior residence in a member state. Indeed, some of its provisions suggest that it is applicable to family members not already lawfully resident in another member state. Thus Article 5(2) allows entry without a residence card while Article 10(2) is an exhaustive list of documents that may need presenting, which nevertheless does not include any documents demonstrating prior <b>lawful</b> <b>residence</b> in another member state.|$|E

This presentation reviews several recommendations and research programs in establishing such data for research. This paper describes creation of the first multi-cohort immigration-to-naturalization dataset for those individuals admitted for <b>lawful</b> permanent <b>residence</b> in 1978 - 1991 with naturalization outcomes observed through 1996. Several studies show the importance of origin country and admission characteristics in explaining differential timing of naturalization. Studies show that understanding naturalization outcomes involves not only considering observed heterogeneity on demographic, origin, and admission characteristics but also controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The discussion reviews improvements in federal statistics on immigrant naturalization and makes recommendations for research on naturalization as an aspect of immigrant incorporation...|$|R
