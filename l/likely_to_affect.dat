5|$|Annual average {{precipitation}} is , {{with most of}} it occurring during the wet season from May through October. However, rainfall occurs in all months, even during the drier months from November through April, mainly as short-lived heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Fort Lauderdale has an average of 143 rain days and 250 sunshine days annually. The hurricane season is between June 1 and November 30 with major hurricanes most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the city or state in September and October. The most recent storms to directly affect the city were Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both of which struck the city in 2005. Other direct hits were Hurricane Cleo in 1964, Hurricane King in 1950, and the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption is most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.|$|E

Rarely, two or even three gallbladders may coexist, either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct, or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct. Additionally, the gallbladder {{may fail to}} form at all. Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist. These abnormalities are not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> function and are generally asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|One mir-2 microRNA in Drosophila, dme-miR-2a-2 , is two {{nucleotides}} offset {{with respect}} to the canonical products of other mir-2 precursors. This is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the function of that particular microRNA. This functional shift is associated to a change in the genomic distribution of mir-2 sequences in Drosophila. The functional diversification of microRNAs may require breaking the genomic linkage between paralogs, probably to avoid the co-regulation of multiple products by the same regulatory sequences.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the habitat {{in areas of}} permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.|$|E
50|$|For unknown reasons, {{females are}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>affected</b> than males, in {{a ratio of}} about 2:1, {{although}} others report this ratio to {{be as high as}} 9:1. Females are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> request treatment for TMD, and their symptoms are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> resolve. Females with TMD are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be nulliparous than females without TMD. It has also been reported that female caucasians are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>affected</b> by TMD, and at an earlier age, than female African Americans.|$|R

25|$|One {{of several}} {{reasons that the}} EPA Administrator {{declined}} to regulate carbon dioxide is uncertainty about whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming. This has attracted great attention to the case. However, the Supreme Court only decided whether the Administrator's reason is a valid reason within the CAA. The Supreme Court did not explicitly decide {{if it is true}} or untrue that man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming, although high-profile comments by Justices during oral argument are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the public debate.|$|E
25|$|Most {{designers}} avoid track switching, instead advocating vehicle-mounted switches or conventional steering. Those designers {{say that}} vehicle-switching permits faster switching, so vehicles can be closer together. It also simplifies the guideway, makes junctions less visually obtrusive {{and reduces the}} impact of malfunctions, because a failed switch on one vehicle is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> other vehicles. Other designers point out that track-switching simplifies the vehicles, {{reducing the number of}} small moving parts in each car. Track-switching replaces in-vehicle mechanisms with larger track-moving components, that can be designed for durability with little regard for weight or size.|$|E
25|$|Overt, {{symptomatic}} thyroid dysfunction is {{the most}} common complication, with about 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of thyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid Graves' disease with active orbitopathy (bulging, inflamed eyes). Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune thyroiditis present with severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), resembling aggressive thyroid tumors – but such symptoms always improve with surgery or corticosteroid therapy. Primary thyroid B cell lymphoma affects fewer than one in a thousand persons, and it is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> those with long-standing autoimmune thyroiditis.|$|E

25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E
25|$|Wealth {{inequality}} in Latin America and the Caribbean remains {{a serious issue}} despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share {{have been attributed to}} the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{constant}} {{media attention}} on preference deals, and a widely held {{belief that the}} two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three {{months prior to the}} election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was there any evidence of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition's first preference vote was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first preference vote of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage points higher than in 2001, while Labor's first-preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest since the elections of 1931 and 1934. Preference flows from minor parties are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> an election outcome when the two major parties are close. The collapse of Labor's primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representatives seats were decided on preferences.|$|E
