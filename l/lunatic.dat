5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private patients. The {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The {{design of the}} buildings and the therapeutic regime were seen as models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General <b>Lunatic</b> Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and the drafting of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E
5|$|Under the Lunacy Statute of 1867, the Master-in-Lunacy {{was able}} commit inebriates to an asylum for any period up to twelve months.

A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's first speech favored {{allowing}} the Kentucky Colonization Society {{to use the}} House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there. Funding internal improvements was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state geologic survey, making the Kentucky River more navigable, chartering a turnpike, incorporating a steamboat company, and funding the Kentucky <b>Lunatic</b> Asylum. As a reward for supporting these projects, he presided over {{the approval of the}} Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad's charter and was appointed director of the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power.

500|$|The Chancery's {{jurisdiction}} over [...] "lunatics" [...] came from two sources: first, the King's prerogative {{to look after}} them, which was exercised regularly by the Lord Chancellor, and second, the Lands of <b>Lunatics</b> Act, which gave the King (and therefore the Chancellor) custodianship of <b>lunatics</b> and their land; the Lord Chancellor exercised the first right directly and the second {{in his role as}} head of the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction applied to any [...] "idiots" [...] or [...] "lunatics", {{regardless of whether or not}} they were British, or whether their land was within England and Wales. They were divided into two categories– idiots, [...] "who have no glimmering of reason from their birth and are, therefore, by law, presumed never likely to attain any", and <b>lunatics,</b> [...] "who have had understanding but have lost the use of it". <b>Lunatics</b> and idiots were administered separately by the Lord Chancellor under his two prerogatives; the appeal under the King's prerogative went directly to the King, and under the Lands of <b>Lunatics</b> Act 1324 to the House of Lords.|$|R

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a <b>lunatic</b> asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the <b>lunatic,</b> not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a <b>lunatic</b> state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls {{on one end of the}} chain. Beside this <b>lunatic</b> is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} <b>lunatic</b> beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and <b>lunatic</b> (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E
50|$|St Luke's Hospital for <b>Lunatics</b> {{was founded}} in London in 1751 for the {{treatment}} of incurable pauper <b>lunatics</b> by a group of philanthropic apothecaries and others.

5|$|While Rinoa {{is being}} treated on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia uses her to free Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to {{activate}} the <b>Lunatic</b> Pandora facility, inciting a rain of creatures from the moon that sends Adel's containment device to the planet. Having selected Adel as her next host, Ultimecia abandons Rinoa in outer space. Squall rescues her, and they return to the planet on a derelict starship. Upon their landing, delegates from Esthar isolate Rinoa for fear of her sorceress abilities, forcing Squall to rescue her. They are met by the President of Esthar who reveals himself to be Laguna and apologizes for the incident and announces Dr. Odine's plan to let Ultimecia possess Rinoa, have Ellone send Rinoa (and thus Ultimecia as well) {{to the past and}} then retrieve only Rinoa back to the present, enabling Ultimecia to achieve Time Compression, as it would allow Squall's group to confront Ultimecia in her time. To do this, Squall's team infiltrates <b>Lunatic</b> Pandora, defeats Seifer and Adel, and has Rinoa inherit Adel's sorceress powers. Time Compression is thus initiated; Squall and his allies travel to Ultimecia's era and defeat her.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from playing by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff <b>Lunatic</b> Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the <b>Lunatic</b> Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged.
