25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your <b>life.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics' growth. These comics had artistic aspirations, and graphic novels became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical [...] and I Never Liked You, and Seth's faux-autobiographical It's a Good <b>Life,</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Don't Weaken garnering considerable attention.|$|E
500|$|Alongside Seth's It's a Good <b>Life,</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Don't Weaken and Joe Matt's The Poor Bastard—works by Brown's Toronto-based {{friends and}} Drawn and Quarterly stablemates—I Never Liked You {{is seen as}} a {{prominent}} example of the 1990s autobiographical comics trend. As one of [...] "The Autobiographical Stories from Yummy Fur", it ranked 38th on The Comics Journals list of the top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century. [...] In 2001 Stephen Weiner included I Never Liked You in his book The 101 Best Graphic Novels, recommending it to those who enjoy J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye.|$|E
500|$|It's a Good <b>Life,</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Don't Weaken was {{serialized}} {{in issues}} #4 (December 1993) through #9 (June 1996) of Seth's comic book Palookaville, published by Drawn and Quarterly. [...] It appeared in collected form in September 1996 {{from the same}} publisher. [...] Seth said his mother used the title phrase {{when he was growing}} up. [...] On the cover, Seth labelled the work [...] "a Picture-Novella"; this allowed him to avoid the term '"graphic novel" [...] and instead use [...] "an antiquated-sounding term".

500|$|In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland's head, Jeff Zycinski, {{stated that}} the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in {{undermining}} celebrities, including Winehouse. He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: [...] "If you play [...] music to a certain demographic, those same {{people want to know}} what's happening in her private <b>life.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't cover it, you're insulting young licence fee payers." [...] In The Scotsman, British singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – [...] "I know Amy Winehouse very well. And she is very different to what people portray her as being. Yes, she does get out of her mind on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can hold it together. You just don't see that side." ...|$|E
500|$|Self-revelatory {{autobiography}} was {{a prominent}} genre in alternative comics in the early 1990s, drawing influence from the works of Robert Crumb, Harvey Pekar, Art Spiegelman, and others of the earlier underground comix generation. [...] Seth had focused on autobiographical stories since Palookaville débuted. [...] Friends of his appeared in them, most prominently fellow Toronto-based cartoonists Chester Brown and Joe Matt, who also featured {{each other in their}} own autobiographical comics. [...] Though a work of fiction, Seth presented It's a Good <b>Life,</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Don't Weaken as another autobiographical story, an approach inspired in part by Lynda Barry, who mixed autobiography with fiction in her comics. [...] Seth, Matt, and Brown shared a melancholy worldview and a self-deprecatory approach, though Seth showed far more restraint in the content of his work than the other two, whose comics revealed personal details such as their authors' masturbation habits.|$|E

Speaking about Gallagher's purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Dónal recalled: [...] "His dream ambition {{was to have a}} guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt {{for the rest of our}} lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for <b>life</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like." ...|$|E
