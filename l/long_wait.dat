Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam; Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia; Victor left {{alone in the house}} waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is what both his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of a jungle environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player starts out close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake starting out miles from civilization and having to work his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E
5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E

On the other hand, the low performance groups (quite opposite) did not show any <b>long</b> <b>waiting</b> times after creating the first component. Instead, the low performance groups spent <b>long</b> <b>waiting</b> times only after editing the arrows which means dealing with the arrows was {{the most difficult part of}} the activity for low performance groups.|$|R

40|$|In Hong Kong, general {{out-patient}} clinics (GOPCs) which aim {{to provide}} primary healthcare service to all residents at an affordable cost plays {{a significant role}} in the healthcare system. Recently, the problem of <b>long</b> <b>waiting</b> time in GOPCs has become significant due to high volume of patients and the shortage of medical staff. If this problem cannot be addressed and solved properly, it would deteriorate the service quality. In this paper, the problem of <b>long</b> <b>waiting</b> time in the target GOPC is systematically investigated. Based on the analysis results, some possible remedies are proposed to resolve the problem of <b>long</b> <b>waiting</b> time, and therefore help improve the service quality as well as the patients' satisfaction...|$|R
25|$|<b>Long</b> <b>wait</b> {{times are}} {{a symptom of}} another issue—quotas {{preventing}} immigrants from receiving immigrant visas.

Immigrants need visas to get off of these waiting lists, and Congress would need to change immigration law {{in order to accommodate}} them with legal status.|$|E

25|$|Tarmo is a Finnish steam-powered {{icebreaker}} {{preserved in}} the Maritime Museum of Finland in Kotka. Built in 1907 by Sir W.G.

When Tarmo was decommissioned in 1970, {{a decision was made}} to preserve the vessel as a museum ship. After a <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> in Helsinki, Tarmo was towed to Kotka and completely restored in the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Many surgery {{procedures}} {{performed in}} medical tourism destinations cost {{a fraction of}} the price they do in other countries. For example, in the United States, a liver transplant that may cost $300,000 USD, would generally cost about $91,000 USD in Taiwan. A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems often have <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> times for certain operations, for example, an estimated 782,936 Canadian patients spent an average waiting time of 9.4 weeks on medical waiting lists in 2005. Canada has also set waiting time benchmarks for non urgent medical procedures, including a 26-week waiting period for a hip replacement and a 16-week wait for cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|Todd Park, the U.S. chief {{technology}} officer, initially said on October 6 that the glitches {{were caused by}} unexpected high volume when the site drew 250,000 simultaneous users instead of the 50,000-60,000 expected. He claimed that the site would have worked with fewer simultaneous users. More than 8.1 million people visited the site from October 1 to 4. White House officials subsequently conceded {{that it was not}} just an issue of volume, but involved software and systems design issues. For example, consumers are required to create an account before being able to compare plans, and the registration process may have created a bottleneck that led to the <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> times. Also, stress tests done by contractors 1 day before the launch date revealed that the site became too slow with only 1,100 simultaneous users, nowhere near even the 50,000-60,000 expected.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} system, {{immediate}} family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for green cards and generally wait 6 {{months to a}} year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating <b>long</b> <b>wait</b> times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.|$|E
