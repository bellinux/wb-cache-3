Therefore, except for the FLD from 2012 to 2016, all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD, e.g., FXDWG (Dyna Wide Glide) and FXDL (Dyna <b>Low</b> <b>Rider).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 2006, Dyna models {{typically}} {{featured a}} narrow, XL-style 39mm front fork and front wheel, {{as well as}} footpegs which the manufacturer included the letter [...] "X" [...] in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which featured thicker 41mm forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) {{was introduced to the}} Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2–1–2 exhaust, twin headlamps, a 180mm rear tire, and, {{for the first time in}} the Dyna lineup, a 130mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards, detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender. [...] The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.|$|E

2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very <b>low</b> <b>rider</b> torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{feud with}} Mysterio, Guerrero was named number one {{contender}} to the World Heavyweight Championship {{and given a}} title match with Batista. Despite this, Guerrero quickly proclaimed himself to be Batista's friend. Batista {{was well aware of}} Guerrero's sneaky reputation, and despite eventually accepting his friendship (initially {{to keep an eye on}} him), Batista would continually play mind games with Guerrero to expose his true intentions. A series of matches with MNM only supported Batista's suspicions that Guerrero was up to no good, as Guerrero appeared to have reverted to his cheating ways. In response to Batista's suspicions, Guerrero helped Batista win a match against his tag team partners, JBL and Christian. Batista defeated Guerrero at No Mercy to retain the World Heavyweight Championship in what would be Guerrero's last pay-per-view match. During the match, Guerrero struggled with a decision about whether or not to use a steel chair to secure the victory, eventually opting not to use it and losing as a result. Though the two demonstrated mutual respect after the match, Guerrero seemed displeased by the loss. Guerrero told Batista that he realized how low he had sunk since losing the WWE Championship in 2004, having attacked his best friend Rey Mysterio. Guerrero told Batista that shaking his hand at No Mercy had returned his respect to him. After the match, Batista called Guerrero back out and sang [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] and, along with the crowd, celebrated Guerrero's 38th birthday. He would make his entrance the following SmackDown! using his signature <b>low</b> <b>rider</b> and old entrance theme with Batista, turning face again for the last time. He wrestled his last match on SmackDown!, airing November 11, defeating Mr. Kennedy using his signature lie, cheat, and steal tactics, which allowed him to advance to the Survivor Series team. On the date of his death, a triple threat match between himself, Batista, and Randy Orton was supposed to take place to air on the following episode of SmackDown! for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Guerrero had been booked to win the title so Batista could take time off to heal from an injured back, but that was later denied by Batista in his book. Orton was given Guerrero's spot in the traditional Survivor Series elimination match between the Raw and SmackDown! brands, which SmackDown! would win, with Orton being the sole survivor.|$|E

The <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> Sport was discontinued in 1994, and the <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> was discontinued after the 2009 model year.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, the FXS <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> was introduced. The <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> had alloy wheels {{front and}} rear, two disc brakes {{on the front}} wheel, {{extended}} forks with a 32° rake, and a 26" [...] seat height. [...] Unlike the Super Glide, the <b>Low</b> <b>Rider</b> was an instant hit; outselling all other Harley-Davidson models in its first full year of production. All three FX models returned to using Fat Bob tanks, but with a special center divider that included a tachometer.|$|E

5000|$|One memorable {{and still}} alive trend along Whittier Boulevard is the usage and showings of lowriders. [...] It {{has been said}} that East Los Angeles, {{specifically}} on Whittier Boulevard {{was one of the few}} first places that <b>low</b> <b>riders</b> began to appear around World War II and up until now, there are still low-rider showings along Whittier Boulevard, or anywhere in East Los Angeles. Drivers would compete against each other and hope to win the other driver’s car, known as [...] "hopping for pink slips.” [...] The street itself became very popular because it became a place for <b>low</b> <b>riders</b> to come together and the locals would cruise up and down the streets. To this day lowriders are still being driven and meet ups occur, where those who still have cars and want to showcase them come together at parks, parking lots, etc. anywhere they find place and come in groups.|$|R

25|$|Bicycles can be {{categorized}} in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion.

5000|$|As well, a new wrinkle {{was added}} to the overall {{championship}} called the [...] "throw out" [...] rule.
