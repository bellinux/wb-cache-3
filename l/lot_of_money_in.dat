He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work.

Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school.

The founders and eleven more employees, however, sued Unomásuno and asked for the company to fully pay for their severance plan. The employees wrote a petition stating that they were fired because PRI politician Francisco Labastida Ochoa was not winning the 2000 presidential race. They said that the owners poured a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> his campaign, including money that was to be used to pay its employees.

The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E
