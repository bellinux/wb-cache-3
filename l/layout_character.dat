This paper {{presents}} {{that while}} evaluating historical architectures in Huizhou, researchers {{should have a}} full consideration of their <b>layout</b> <b>character</b> of relatively concentrated, place these point-form historical architectures into line-form and surface-form architecture groups, then build a more perfect and scientific three-dimensional evaluation method. It also shows that firstly researchers could use GIS technology to associate graphic data, properties and image data of selected historical architectures in Huizhou; secondly researchers can finish information integration and realize the scientific grading and classification of the architectures by weighting, quantizing and analyzing the evaluation information of these architectures; and finally finish the database under the help of GIS...|$|E
40|$|Touchscreens {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} as useful for many applications. Although a traditional mechanical keyboard is the device of choice when entering alphanumeric data, {{it may not be}} optimal when only limited data must be entered, or when the keyboard <b>layout,</b> <b>character</b> set, or size may be changed. A series of experiments has demonstrated the usability of touchscreen keyboards. The first study indicated that users who type 58 wpm on a traditional keyboard can type 25 wpm using a touchscreen and that the traditional monitor position is suboptimal for touchscreen use. A second study reported on typing rates for keyboards of various sizes (from 6. 8 to 24. 6 cm wide). Novices typed approximately 10 wpm on the smallest and 20 wpm on the largest of the keyboards. Users experienced with touchscreen keyboards typed 21 wpm on the smallest and 32 wpm on the largest. We then report on a recent study done with more representative users and more difficult tasks. Thirteen cashiers were recruited for this study and were required to complete ten trials in which they typed names and addresses with punctuation. Results indicate that the users improved rapidly from 9. 5 wpm on the first trial to 13. 8 wpm on the last trial, reaching their fastest performance after only 25 minutes. Although custom interfaces will be preferred for special types of data (e. g. telephone numbers, times, dates, colors) there will always be situations when limited quantities of text must be entered. In these situations a touchscreen keyboard can be used. (Also cross-referenced as CAR-TR- 585...|$|E
