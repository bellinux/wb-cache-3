5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Don't Starve was Klei's {{first foray}} into the {{survival}} genre. Conceived {{during the height of}} a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé of the hardest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in {{isometric}} projection. The player may change the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, {{all of which can}} be increased by leveling up.|$|E
5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, retro artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned {{that not all}} players would appreciate the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> The game was a commercial success, and sold {{more than one million}} copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development for release in 2018.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received on release; critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> perceived lack of new content and courses, and paucity of new game features {{were seen as}} the game's primary faults. Despite generally good press, the game was a financial disappointment. Wipeout 3 was the last title in the series {{to appear on the}} PlayStation and the next entry, Wipeout Fusion, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 platform in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{the game}} {{received}} critical acclaim and sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide within {{five months of}} release. The game's audio, dungeon and puzzle design, open structure, and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> were highly praised by critics. The introduction of new features such as the wall-merging mechanics and item rental system were well received, with reviewers complimenting how well they integrated with the existing gameplay formula. The game also received multiple awards and nominations from video game and media publications.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|Super Meat Boy is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend Bandage Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 levels. Players attempt to {{reach the end of}} each level, represented by Bandage Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, saw blades, and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or slide down walls. The core gameplay requires fine control and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts 'n Goblins.|$|E
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{compared}} to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, it employs cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty,</b> without any formal ending.|$|E

5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements to core and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated into every area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were {{among the best in the}} franchise's history. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than a frustrating one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E
