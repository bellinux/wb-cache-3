5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player runs out of <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> lose.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E

5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have vastly different <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Book Six, Widow Kang, {{follows the}} life of Chinese widow Kang Tongbi {{during the reign of}} the Qianlong Emperor. She takes in a poor Buddhist monk, Bao Ssu, and his son whom she finds scavenging, but the monk is wrongly implicated in a series of queue {{cuttings}} and is killed by Qing magistrates. Later, Kang meets a Hui Muslim scholar named Ibrahim ibn Hasam and together they discover it is possible to remember their past <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> marry and move to Lanzhou in western China, where they undertake work to try to reconcile Islamic and Confucian beliefs. Kang creates and collects works of proto-feminist poetry and becomes a known writer. There is a Muslim rebellion in the region due to the Qing intolerance of new Islamic sects coming from the west, but the revolt is crushed with massive force.|$|E

5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past <b>lives</b> <b>they</b> have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E

5|$|In the First World War, 320 {{soldiers}} {{came from}} Mersea Island, of which 50 lost their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> are commemorated at the War Memorial at the parish church. Troops were stationed at Mersea Island during the war. In 1916, a Zeppelin crash landed at nearby Great Wigborough {{to the northwest}} of the island. The survivors were stationed at Mersea before moving to prisoner-of-war camps. In 2013, the Mersea Island Tales Educational Trust obtained {{a grant from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund to set up a First World War exhibition at Ivy Farm, which features a 1916 Sopwith Pup biplane and information about soldiers from Mersea {{who took part in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|Separate {{from the}} main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five {{attributes}} (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark it assumes that form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their <b>lives</b> <b>they</b> reincarnate.|$|E

5|$|Still {{carrying}} a grudge against Robbit, Aloha seeks Kabuki and convinces him {{to form an}} alliance {{so that they can}} destroy Robbit together. In exchange, Aloha will pay Kabuki a large amount of money, and Kabuki, also desiring revenge against Robbit, agrees. Aloha and Kabuki attack Little Muu together, prompting Robbit to take action again. Eventually, Robbit and Kabuki battle each other one last time, and Robbit manages to destroy Kabuki once and for all while Aloha flees for his life once again. At the end of the game, Aloha returns to Little Muu, but is disowned by all the Muu Muus, who now resent him for teaming with Kabuki (who had tried to destroy them all) and trying to destroy Robbit, who had saved their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> throw him out of the bar and tell him to never come back.|$|E
5|$|When the Crypto Jews {{arrived on}} the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid {{religious}} scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to worship, the Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|E

5|$|On 14 January 1892, {{six weeks}} after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia, leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just {{recovered}} from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with typhoid fever, the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert. Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning. A year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. Throughout their <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their <b>lives,</b> <b>they</b> decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
5|$|The Dominicans {{soon came}} into {{conflict}} with the established colonists. They refused to take confessions or give sacraments to Spaniards who mistreated Indians, and {{even went so far}} as to imprison a dean and excommunicate the president of the Audiencia Real. Colonial opposition to the actions of the Dominicans reached such dangerous levels that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their <b>lives.</b> <b>They</b> established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. Las Casas based himself in the former, and friar Tomás Casillas took charge of Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The territory of Chiapas was subdivided into a number of regions based on prehispanic divisions; these were the Chiapaneca, Lakandon, Mokaya, Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Zoque. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority.|$|E
