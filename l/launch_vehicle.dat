5|$|Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made {{an effort}} to develop the Polar Satellite <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.|$|E
5|$|Direct Ascent: The {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched {{as a unit}} and travel directly to the Moon and land. It would return, leaving its landing stage on the Moon. This design would have required development of the extremely powerful Nova <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} altitude tests, the spacecraft {{was removed from}} the altitude chamber on January 3, 1967, and mated to its Saturn IB <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> on pad 34 on January 6.|$|E
5000|$|Third {{generation}} <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> — {{beyond the}} Space Shuttle and [...] "X" [...] planes — are founded on various cutting-edge technologies, such as advanced propellants that pack more energy into smaller tanks {{and result in}} smaller <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Advanced thermal protection systems also will be necessary for future <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> because they will fly faster through the atmosphere, resulting in higher structural heating than today's vehicles.|$|R

5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{used more}} than one <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle {{combination}} series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compare Mercury-Redstone 3, Mercury-Atlas 6) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time manned flights began.|$|E
5|$|The European Space Agency {{selected}} the L1-class JUICE mission in 2012 {{as part of}} its Cosmic Vision programme to explore three of Jupiter's Galilean moons, with a possible Ganymede lander provided by Roscosmos. JUICE is proposed to be launched in 2022. ISRO will launch the first Indian mission to Jupiter in 2022 or 2023 through Geosynchronous Satellite <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Mark III.|$|E
50|$|While the R-7 {{turned out}} to be {{impractical}} as a weapon, it became the basis for a series of Soviet expendable space <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The derivatives of the R-7 missile became successful space <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which are still being used in modified form.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the responsibility of}} the Vehicle Control Systems Branch at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to analyze, evaluate, define, design, verify, and specify requirements for advanced <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> and related space projects, and to conduct research in advanced flight control concepts. Attention is given to branch responsibilities which include Shuttle-C, Shuttle-C Block II, Shuttle-Z, lunar cargo <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles,</b> Mars cargo <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles,</b> orbital maneuvering vehicle, automatic docking, tethered satellite, aeroassisted flight experiment, and solid rocket booster parachute recovery system design...|$|R
50|$|LPSC {{is engaged}} in {{development}} of liquid and cryogenic propulsion stages for <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> and auxiliary propulsion systems for both <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> and satellites. Activities related to liquid propulsion stages, cryogenic propulsion stages and control systems for <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> and spacecraft is done at Thiruvananthapuram. Precision fabrication facilities, development of transducers and integration of satellite propulsion systems are carried out at Bangalore. The developmental and flight tests along with assembly and integration are done at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu.|$|R
5|$|The Voyager 1 probe was {{launched}} on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, Voyager 1 reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{was planned}} to be implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project {{managers}} to consider {{looking at the}} Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project's scientific team was selected. The group included notable names {{from the world of}} extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy. The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program.|$|E
50|$|The SLP at SHAR is a {{state-of-the-art}} launch complex. SLP is configured {{as a universal}} launch pad capable of accommodating all the <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> of ISRO including the advanced <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{to be built in}} the next decade and beyond. It became operational in 2005.|$|R
40|$|United States {{policy for}} {{national}} space launch capability {{provides for a}} balanced mix of launches, utilizing the Space Shuttle and Expendable <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (ELVs). The current mixed fleet includes the Space Shuttle and four expendable <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> - Titan, Atlas, Delta, and Scout. New small class <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles,</b> including Pegasus, are in development. In addition, studies are underway {{to assure that the}} United States has cost-effective, reliable access to space, heavy-lift launch capability, and a new manned spacecraft after the current Space Shuttle reaches the end of its operational life. This paper highlights the current capabilities of the mixed fleet and summarizes the plans for new or modified United States <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> through {{the first decade of the}} next century...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{theoretical}} {{studies and}} funded development {{projects that are}} currently underway provide answers to the [...] "Are propellant depots feasible?" [...] question. Studies have shown that a depot-centric architecture with smaller <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> could be [...] less expensive than a heavy-lift architecture over a 20-year time frame. [...] The cost of large <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> is so high that a depot able to hold the propellant lifted by two or more medium-sized <b>launch</b> <b>vehicles</b> may be cost effective and support more payload mass on beyond-Earth orbit trajectories.|$|R
5|$|Manned Apollo {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the Lunar Module (LM) and Saturn V Moon rocket continued. The Saturn IB <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> for Apollo 1, AS-204, {{was used for the}} first LM test flight, Apollo 5. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the second}} Block I flight AS-205 was {{canceled}} as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1. McDivitt's crew was now promoted to prime {{crew of the}} Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> would be used in place of AS-207. A third manned mission was planned to launch the CSM and LM together on a Saturn V (AS-503) to an elliptical medium Earth orbit (MEO), to be crewed by Frank Borman, Michael Collins and William Anders. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart had started their training for AS-258 in CM-101 at the NAA plant in Downey, California, when the Apollo 1 accident occurred.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{began to}} plan to resume staffed {{missions}} following the call by U.S. President George W. Bush on 14 January 2004 for a staffed {{mission to the}} Moon by 2019 {{and the construction of}} a lunar base by 2024. The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a staffed spacecraft and <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and design studies for a lunar base. However, that program has been cancelled in favor of a staffed asteroid landing by 2025 and a staffed Mars orbit by 2035. India has also expressed its hope to send a staffed mission to the Moon by 2020.|$|E

5|$|SIM Lite was {{originally}} proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (EELV). As {{a result of}} continued budget cuts, the launch date was pushed back at least five times. NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015. As of February 2007, many of the engineers working on the SIM program had {{moved on to other}} areas and projects, and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction. However, the preliminary budget for NASA for 2008 included zero dollars for SIM.|$|E
5|$|When NASA {{was created}} that same year, the Air Force program was {{transferred}} to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard Freedom7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight. John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit, by an Atlas <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> on February 20, 1962, aboard Friendship7. Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a {{scientist}} after becoming {{a member of the}} Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle,</b> because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|PSLV-C37 (also {{known as}} Cartosat-2 series satellite) was the 39th {{mission of the}} Indian Polar Satellite <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (PSLV) program and its 16th mission in the XL configuration. PSLV-C37 {{successfully}} carried and deployed a record 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. Launched on 15 February 2017 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, it broke the earlier record of launching 37 satellites by a Russian Dnepr rocket on 19 June 2014. The cost of the launch was US$15million. According to ISRO, the 101 international satellites were launched {{as part of a}} commercial arrangement between several countries and its commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, run {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Government's Department of Space.|$|E
