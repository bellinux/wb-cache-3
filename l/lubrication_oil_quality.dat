40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the costs of wind energy, it is {{necessary}} to improve the wind turbine availability and reduce the operational and maintenance costs. The reliability and availability of a functioning wind turbine depend largely on the protective properties of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> for its drive train subassemblies such as gearbox and means for <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> condition monitoring and degradation detection.

30|$|The {{types of}} surface textures {{influenced}} the friction coefficient behaviors markedly {{as shown in}} Table  3. The variation of the friction coefficient between cylinder liner and piston ring of the {{two different types of}} surface texture processed by CNCPM were compared and analyzed. At the load of 200  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was smaller than that in the micro-concave surface. The possible reasons were that when the micro V-groove were ran at a low load, the existence of the grooves made the cylinder liner surface store amount of <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil,</b> which was much more than that in the micro-concave surface. The <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> slowed down the wear of CLPR friction pair. And thus the friction coefficient was relatively low at the load of 200  N. When the applied load increased to 400  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was larger than that in the micro-concave surface. This is because that when the load increased, the wear surfaces of friction pairs were forced into close contact. Due {{to the fact that the}} length of the groove was larger than the thickness of piston ring and the diameter of micro-concave was smaller than the thickness of piston ring, the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> in the micro V-groove was more readily to be squeezed out than the micro-concave. Hence, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was larger than that of micro-concave at the load of 400  N. When the applied load grew to 600  N, the lubrication environment of CLPT became harshest. A large number and different kinds of wear particles generated. For the micro V-groove cylinder liner, some wear particles were whirled away by the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil.</b> In addition, the micro V-groove could retain more and larger size of wear particles than the micro-concave. Consequently, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was lower than that of micro-concave at the load of 600  N.|$|R

40|$|PM in {{diesel exhaust}} {{has been given}} much {{attention}} due to its adverse effect on both climate and health. As the PM emission levels are tightened, the portion of particles originating from the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil</b> is likely to increase. In this study, exhausts from a biodiesel-fueled Euro 5 engine were examined {{to determine how much}} of the carbonaceous particles that originated from the fuel and the <b>lubrication</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. A combination of three methods was used to determine the PM origin: chain length analysis of the hydrocarbons, determination of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), and the concentration of 14 C found in the exhausts. It was found that the standard method for measuring hydrocarbons in PM on a filter (chain length analysis) only accounted for 63 % of the OC, meaning that it did not account for all non-soot carbon in the exhausts. Comparing the chain length method to the 14 C-based method showed that the non-extractable organic carbon originated both from the oil and fuel. Elemental carbon (EC), also known as soot, was found to originate mainly from the fuel. However, excessive amounts of oil in the engine cylinders increased the relative contribution from the oil as well as the absolute emissions of EC. This could either be due to the surplus oil forming soot, or to the soot particles being coated by oil and thereby less efficiently oxidized during the late cycle.

40|$|Determining <b>oil</b> <b>quality</b> is an {{important}} part of any industry that uses <b>oil</b> as <b>lubrication.</b> Over time <b>oil</b> <b>quality</b> degrades with use or from contaminants being introduced. Since the majority of systems that use oil are closed systems there is no way to remove contaminants or recycle the oil to its original state. The only option is to change the oil. Even with frequent oil changes there is still a chance that a contaminant can be introduced, causing a failure. Currently there are sensors that test <b>oil</b> <b>quality,</b> but they are bulky compared to a Microelectromechanical (MEMs) multi-sensor. The objective of this project is to make a low cost industrial fluid multi-sensor to replace larger sensors that exists today. The industrial fluids multi-sensor will measure; <b>oil</b> <b>quality,</b> water in <b>oil</b> and temperature of the <b>oil.</b> The <b>quality</b> of the <b>oil</b> will be determined by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This will be accomplished by using an interdigitated finger (IDF) electrodes to measure the impedance of the oil at different frequencies. With regular use and the introduction of other contaminants the resulting impedance changes, ultimately telling when your oil is old or contaminated and needs to be changed. Water in oil will also be tested. An IDF capacitor with a polyimide coating will be used to determine the water in oil. Water in oil is important to sense because the oil does not lubricate as well if water is present. The polyimide absorbs the water, which changes the dielectric constant of the polyimide and increases the capacitance as water is added. The detection of water can be used as an early indication that there is a leak or a broken gasket. Not fixing this problem can lead to a seized engine or non-uniform wearing of gears. The temperature of the oil will be measured with a thin film resistor. The thin film resistor changes resistance as the temperature changes. Depending on the thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR), a greater or less change in resistance will occur for different materials. Two revisions of the multi-sensor were designed, manufactured and tested at RIT. The EIS sensor and Temperature sensor were also tested by an outside company. One temperature sensor and 18 IDF capacitors made of tantalum were designed in Design 1. The IDF capacitors were used as either an EIS or water in oil sensor by adding polyimide. Design 1 had three major shortcomings that lead to Design 2. The first improvement was that all three sensors needed to put on one chip. Secondly, the nominal capacitance of the water in oil sensor needed to be increased. Lastly a different metal was needed for the temperature sensor because tantalum has either a positive or negative temperature coefficient of resistance. A new fabrication process was used to fabricate Design 2 to be able to get smaller widths and spaces of the IDFs. Two EIS, water in oil and one temperature sensor were designed in Design 2. All of the sensors in Design 2 were nickel on top of titanium. <b>Quality</b> of <b>oil,</b> water in oil and temperature were all able to be successfully tested using Design 2...|$|R
