25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Cosimo's {{uncle had}} begun a bank with his {{third of the}} ownership stake in Vieri's bank, and it closed in 1443 {{with the death of}} the grandson of Averardo, taking with it the Medici branch in Pisa. Formerly, any business that the Medici needed to transact in Pisa (such as Cosimo forwarding Donatello money to buy marble) had been done through them. On December 26, 1442, a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>partnership</b> was formed with two outsiders. Over time, the Medici progressively reduced their investment in this partnership, and it appears that they withdrew completely sometime shortly after 1457, with only one partner keeping it running until 1476.|$|E

2500|$|... 1446 saw {{the start}} of two Medici branches: the sub-branch that was the Bruges branch was {{converted}} into a full partnership, and a <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>partnership</b> in Avignon, the largest center of trade in southern France (despite {{the departure of the}} Papacy). Within 2 years, the Avignon branch was converted into a full partnership. The Medici branch at Lyons was not actually founded as a separate branch; it came about {{as a result of the}} gradual move of the Geneva branch, due to the reduction in traffic to the fairs at Geneva and the establishment of four major fairs in Lyons which attracted around 140 other Florentine businesses). The move was completed in 1466.|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 1439, the Medici branch at Bruges {{was officially}} founded.

When Angelo Tani (14151492) became junior partner in 1455, the branch was finally created as a full and equal partnership in the Medici bank.
