5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} gigging that year became regulars on the underground <b>live</b> <b>circuit</b> in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As {{the most qualified}} musician, Wright was responsible for tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner to tune guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full-time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear {{at the end of}} each gig.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} be a huge attraction on the <b>live</b> <b>circuit,</b> with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E

The Irish Times selected their South by Southwest performance in Austin, Texas in March 2008 {{as the best}} by any Irish act at the event. The band also performed at the Razz Club in Barcelona, Spain. However, they kept a low enough profile on the Irish <b>live</b> <b>circuit</b> {{for much of the}} year, only performing at a small number of festivals, including Oxegen, the Bandon Music Festival and the Drogheda Arts Festival. The Irish Times noted their performance in Pet Sounds on the Sunday of Oxegen 2008 by reminiscing upon their performance from two years previously in front of a smaller crowd early on a Sunday morning. Performances of the singles [...] "Basis of Everything" [...] and [...] "The Rules" [...] at Oxegen 2008 were described as having [...] "the kind of hummable sheen that sounds as perfect at a festival as on the radio".|$|E
500|$|By early 1983, the Smiths {{had gained}} a large {{following}} on the UK <b>live</b> <b>circuit</b> and {{had signed a}} record deal with the indie label Rough Trade. The deal, along with positive concert reviews in the weekly music press and an upcoming session on John Peel's radio show on BBC Radio 1, generated a large media buzz for the band. In a music scene dominated by corporate and video-driven acts, the Smiths' camp and bookish image stood out, and many expected the band to be the breakthrough act of the UK post-punk movement. The previous October Frankie Goes to Hollywood released their iconic track [...] "Relax", which {{was seen as an}} anthem to an out alpha male self-assertiveness, and alien to many UK homosexuals. However, the Smiths' May 1983 debut single [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] {{failed to live up to}} critical and commercial expectations, mostly due to its perceived low production values. When Rough Trade label mates Aztec Camera began to receive day-time national radio-play with their track [...] "Walk out to Winter", Marr admitted to [...] "feeling a little jealous, my competitive urges kicked in". The guitarist believed the Smiths needed an up-beat song, [...] "in a major key", to gain a chart positioning that would live up to expectations.|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old <b>live</b> <b>circuit</b> again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E

Except cases of victims catching the overhead wire of a train, which is a high voltage electric current, all other cases were of low-voltage electric current sources. Underestimation of the danger of <b>live</b> <b>circuits</b> and carelessness play a part in work place incidents whereas ignorance, faulty domestic appliances, frayed or broken flex of electric cables, and improper earthing accounts for many of the domestic accidents (Odesanmi 1987; Hussain and Khan 2015; Polson et al. 1985).|$|R

A further single, [...] "You Better Run" [...] was released on Columbia Records and produced by Kim Fowley. This last single was reported by Powell to have topped the regional midland charts although it failed to make any national impact. Between 1966 and 1967, the band's performance centred on the R and Tamla Motown styles, while Noddy's flair for showmanship began to give the band a focus. During 1967, the band recorded the track [...] "Delighted to See You" [...] which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation Psychedelia at Abbey Road.

Later that summer the band would create their name, after the drug Dexedrine which was used by fans of Northern soul, and began a rigorous rehearsing and writing schedule, practicing for about 9 hours every day. In November 1978 the band entered the UK <b>live</b> <b>circuit</b> and gained a reputation for their strong performances, which included covers of classic soul songs and originals. Rowland and Archer employed a strict code of conduct, ruling out and drinking or drug use before performances, and introduced many of the band members to activities such as shoplifting expeditions and bumping trains.|$|E
