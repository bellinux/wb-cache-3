In contrast to the analytical solutions so far described, this numerical approach is particularly versatile. With a minimization algorithm, D and the probe mobile fraction can be readily calculated for any recovery time under various experimental conditions.

40|$|International audienceDielectric barrier {{discharges}} (DBDs) are {{a promising}} technology for high-intensity sources of specific UV and VUV radiation. In this work, the microdischarge dynamics in DBDs for Ne−Xe mixtures under the close conditions of excimer <b>lamp</b> <b>working</b> has been investigated. The computer model including the cathode fall, the positive column and the dielectric {{is composed of}} two coupled sub-models. The first submodel describes the electrical properties of the discharge {{and is based on}} a fluid, two-moments description of electron and ion transport coupled with Poisson's equation during the discharge pulse. The second submodel, based on three main modules: a plasma chemistry module, a circuit module and a Boltzmann equation module, with source terms deduced from the electric model, describes the time variations of charged and excited species concentrations and the UV photon emission. The use of the present description allows a good resolution near the sheath at high pressure and it predicts correctly the waveform of the discharge behavior. The effects of operation voltage, dielectric capacitance, gas mixture composition, gas pressure, as well as the secondary electron emission by ion at the cathode on the discharge characteristics and the 173 nm photon generation have been investigated and discussed...|$|E

Such instruments certainly do offer measurement accuracy beyond that of the slit lamp and are designed that they can be used on the patient by non-specialists, but they always focus on specific parts of the eye (Kaschke et al. 2014).

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI), {{atmospheric pressure}} chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI) {{are the most}} important techniques for the ionization of liquid samples. However, working under atmospheric pressure conditions, all these techniques involve some chemical rather than purely physical processes, and therefore, side reactions often yield to matrix-dependent ionization efficiencies. Here, a system is presented that combines both soft single-photon ionization (SPI) and hard 70 eV electron impact ionization (EI) of dissolved compounds under vacuum conditions. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was modified to enable direct EI, a technique developed by Cappiello et al. to obtain library-searchable EI mass spectra as well as soft SPI mass spectra of sample solutions. An electron beam-pumped rare gas excimer <b>lamp</b> <b>working</b> at 126 nm was used as well as a focusable vacuum UV light source for single-photon ionization. Both techniques, EI and SPI, were applied successfully for flow injection experiments providing library-matchable EI fragment mass spectra and soft SPI mass spectra, showing dominant signals for the molecular ion. Four model compounds were analyzed: hexadecane, propofol, chlorpropham, and eugenol, with detection limits in the picomolar range. This novel combination of EI and SPI promises great analytical benefits, thanks to the possibility of combining database alignment for EI data and molecular mass information provided by SPI. Possible applications for the presented ionization technology system are a matrix-effect-free detection and a rapid screening of different complex mixtures without time-consuming sample preparation or separation techniques (e. g., for analysis of reaction solutions in combinatorial chemistry) or a switchable hard (EI) and soft (SPI) MS method as detection step for liquid chromatography...|$|E

The solar charge station is constructed on Classrooms Building in Engineering Faculty of Izmir Institute of Technology. Sixteen monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules having the dimensions of 1. 293 mx 0. 329 mx 0. 034 m and 55 W power rating are used as the photovoltaic generator of the solar charge station. Modules are mounted as if they create an. Omega Shape. which gives its name to the station (Omega Type Solar Charge Station). Vertical and tilted reflectors are used to enhance the electricity generation. Generated electricity is used to charge a lead acid battery, which is protected by five solar charge regulators in order to prevent discharging and overcharging. 50 W halogen <b>lamps</b> <b>working</b> with direct current are chosen as the loads. The system is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical results have shown that Omega Type Solar Charge Station generates more or less steady electricity, approximately 240 MJ through a year period. The reflectors operate better in winter than in summer, theoretically. According to the stations shape, it uses less space on rooftops. Experiments have shown that efficiency of the charge station during summer is considerably high. The efficiencies calculated by using direct solar radiation on inclined surface is 31. 65315 %, for the experiment on 21. 08. 2003, 27. 90379 % for the experiment carried out without reflectors on 11. 09. 2003 and 35. 70939 % for the experiment carried out with optimum inclination angles for September, on 12. 09. 2003.
