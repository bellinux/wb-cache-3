5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. It {{is measured by}} assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E

5|$|Byne's disease, more {{accurately}} known as Bynesian decay, is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction) which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display for <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E
40|$|Primate {{species have}} a <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{infantile}} dependency, {{and the majority}} of their behavior is learned through interaction with others of their species rather than being instinctual. In a social context, primates learn how and what to eat, proper sexual behavior, and communication skills, among the most basic of survival techniques. Without this <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> socialization, the individual primate is not adequately equipped to survive in his environment. Among the primate species, Homo sapiens has the <b>longest</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> infantile dependency and also the most complex and elaborate range of behavior...|$|R

5|$|Changes that predate {{magnetic}} observatories {{are recorded}} in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes {{are referred to}} as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.|$|E
5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time {{and have a}} slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, {{they are capable of}} quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|By February 1918, {{the crews}} of Sankt Georg {{and several other}} {{warships}} grew weary {{of the war and}} the <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> inactivity, which led to the Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Developments in technology, such as computers, {{satellite}} communication, and the Internet, {{have contributed}} to many improvements within the industry. These developments have increased the productivity of company operations, saved {{the time and effort}} of drivers, and provided new, more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time away from home. In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards for diesel trucks (reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines) which promises to improve air quality and public health.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{parts of}} the state began {{suffering}} the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.|$|E

5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E

5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{inherited}} a vast fortune and a prosperous economy {{from his father}} Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to £1,250,000 (£375million by today's standards). By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> mismanagement damaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest}} of his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
