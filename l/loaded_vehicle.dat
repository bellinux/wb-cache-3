50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} is {{a device that}} {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the exhaust system, and creates substantial exhaust back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an exhaust brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. Exhaust brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced exhaust brakes have exhaust pressure modulation (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|E

The book says that the road safety mantra called the [...] "Three E's" [...] ("Engineering, Enforcement and Education") was created by the industry in the 1920s to distract attention from the real problems of vehicle safety, such as the fact that some were sold with tires that could not bear the weight of a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle.</b> To the industry, he said [...] "Enforcement" [...] and [...] "Education" [...] meant the driver, while [...] "Engineering" [...] was all about the road. As late as 1965, he noted, 320 million federal dollars were allocated to highway beautification, while just $500,000 was dedicated to highway safety.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, {{truck drivers}} use the engine brake to help match the engine speed to the gear. The most common {{situation}} {{is with a}} <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> which has no split gears or half gears in the lower range, from gears 1-4. In this case, it is especially difficult and sometimes impossible to get from 1 to 2, and sometimes even from 2-3 while starting on a hill. The problem is {{that by the time}} the engine speed has dropped sufficiently to enable a shift into the higher gear, the vehicle will have slowed down too much or possibly even stopped, making the shift impossible. The engine brakes, which on some models can be set to different intensities (retarding variable numbers of engine cylinders) enable a shift by dropping the engine speed quickly enough to catch the higher gear before the vehicle has decelerated too much. This technique, sometimes called [...] "jake shifting", requires high skill and much practice shifting without the clutch, and is usually not recommended among truck drivers because mistakes can cause damage to the transmission.|$|E

These tires are typically subjected to loads that are over two times those experienced by a passenger car tire. The results obtained through experimental modal analysis were compared to similar results obtained for standard passenger car tires. The comparisons show that the heavily loaded tire has unique dynamic characteristics. Complex damping and nonlinear behavior were considered to explain these characteristics. A flexible ring tire model was used to investigate these nonlinear characteristics. Complex damping was also examined to explain the experimental observations. This thesis contains {{some of the first}} results on vibration characterization of heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> tires. The incorporation of the results into a multi-degree-of-freedom tire model for use with the Effective Road Profile Control scheme used for vehicle durability simulation studies was also investigated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{gravity center}} {{position}} of the loaded car-body is always constant during the dynamic analysis currently. To enhance vehicle dynamic analysis for goods transportation, multi-body system dynamics and vehicle-track coupling dynamics are the basic theories for the study. The car-body which includes goods model is called loaded car-body, and its gravity center calculation formulas are put forward based on Chinas railway goods loading technical standards. After that, the vertical, lateral, rolling, pitching and yawing vibration modes dynamic equations are established for loaded car-body. The C 70 open top vehicle is an example for the calculation of different height of gravity center of <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and the railway line condition is grade in China. The derailment coefficient and wheel unloading rate peak value under the loading and running conditions are all going up with the height rising of gravity center of <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This paper gives a feasible method for the further study on vehicle dynamic characteristics in railway goods transportation...|$|E

It should be noted that when the semi-trailer holds a container, the commodity type is generally unknown to the driver. In other cases, the driver generally bears a document (the waybill) which describes the freight, the pickup and delivery times, as well as the route. If {{there is more than one}} commodity, different approaches can be chosen. A preferred approach is to ask the driver the type of the main commodity.|$|E

40|$|Consumers may {{be unaware}} {{of the risk of}} {{rollover}} crashes posed by passenger loads in vehicles with poor roll stability. This analysis demonstrates that certain sports utility vehicles and small pickup trucks have designs that are so unstable that the weight of the passengers in the vehicle affects its propensity to roll over. This effect occurs even though the weight of the <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> is less than the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating. The risk of a fatal, "untripped" rollover crash in vehicles with low roll stability is increased as each passenger is added to the vehicle load...|$|E

The objective is to minimise {{the sum of the}} costs incurred by vehicle maintenance, empty vehicle repositioning and vehicle leasing. A novel integrated model is presented. The optimal empty repositioning policy for a particular fleet size is shown to be of the threshold control type. The explicit form of the cost function under such threshold controls is obtained. The optimal threshold values and fleet-size are then derived. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper conducts an {{empirical}} investigation on the temporal stability of parameters of freight demand {{models in the}} short-medium term. The analyses are based on seven national freight origin-destination samples conducted by the Colombian government during the years 1999 to 2005. The paper studies {{the stability of the}} parameters of freight generation and freight distribution. Typical formulations of these models were calibrated using the cross-sectional data corresponding to each year. Then, to identify time-dependent effects, the resulting parameters were regressed as a function of a time index. The results indicate the presence of statistically signifi cant time-dependent effects on all freight generation models (production and attraction), {{as well as on the}} freight distribution model estimated with <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> trips. In contrast, the parameters of the freight distribution models based on commodity fl ows were found to be stable overtime...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} mitigation of acceleration to passengers on a blast <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Small scale explosive testing {{was conducted to}} simulate the detonation of a buried mine on a vehicle. Tests were conducted in saturated sand, which will act as the loading mechanism on the simulated vehicle. Piezoelectric accelerometers, in conjunction with high speed cameras, were used to record test data. Two forms of mitigation were utilized in this research: hull shaping and crushing polyurea-coated thin-walled cylinders. Hull shaping deflects the blast, while the polyurea-coated thin-walled cylinders are crushed to absorb energy. Both forms of mitigation were tested, both separately and together, to determine their effectiveness at mitigating acceleration on the simulated vehicle. The goal of this dissertation {{is to determine the}} effectiveness of different mitigation techniques at reducing acceleration in order to design safer military vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Three-wheelers (auto rickshaws) {{are light}} and {{inexpensive}} vehicles {{capable of carrying}} up to three passengers or a cargo of 6, 000 Newton and are mostly found in developing countries. Experimental modal analysis was carried out on a newly designed diesel auto rickshaw mainly to validate and update the finite element model of the auto chassis. With 495 degrees of freedom, the finite element model stiffness matrix was updated using the first four eigenvalues and eigenvectors measured at 63 points. Difficulties involved in model updating of complex structures using incomplete measured data have been discussed. Eigensolution with an updated model produces natural frequencies close to the measured values. Mass and stiffness modification {{studies were carried out}} on the updated model to simulate a fully <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle</b> and were correlated with the resonant peaks experienced when the fully loaded auto was running at 30 kmph on typical bad roads...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle chassis {{control systems}} aim at {{increasing}} vehicle safety and performance, while ensuring superior passenger comfort. Nearly all control algorithms {{are sensitive to}} the inertial parameters of a vehicle. As the vehicle mass, the moments of inertia, and the center of gravity (COG) position can change significantly during operation, an accurate online estimation of these properties could substantially improve the performance of an active system. This paper presents an innovative algorithm for the online estimation of the inertial parameters of a road-vehicle. Using low-frequent suspension displacement signals and suspension stiffness characteristics, the vehicle mass and horizontal COG position are estimated. A Monte Carlo method determines the most probable mass distribution. Based on the assigned passenger weight, anthropometric data sets allow to calculate the inertial properties of every passenger, eventually resulting in the inertial parameters of the complete, <b>loaded</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is validated by means of a test campaign on an accurate kinematics and compliance testrig. status: publishe...|$|E
