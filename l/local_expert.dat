5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a <b>local</b> <b>expert</b> in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the {{difficulties}} inherent in the enlarged war was the siting of Lima Site 85 on a mountaintop at Phou Pha Thi, Laos. This clandestine guidance radar facility was proposed at a mid-1967 meeting chaired by General Hunter Harris. Its purpose was radar directed air raids into Hanoi. Lair's opinion of the installation was asked, as he was the <b>local</b> <b>expert,</b> and he was being charged with its defense. He predicted that the Vietnamese would build a road toward the radar site until they could attack it. When asked if LS 85 could be defended, Lair pointed out that guerrilla forces were not equipped or trained for fixed defensive battles. He recommended the use of special forces or other trained infantry for defense, but his request was rejected. In January 1968, North Vietnamese forces bypassed the site temporarily to attack royalist positions at the Battle of Nam Bac. Despite the PAVN's delay of the battle, Lair's prediction of Lima Site 85's fall was prophetic. The radar site was captured by Vietnamese sappers on 11 March 1968 even though Hmong guerrillas and Thai mercenaries remained on the mountain. Shackley had predicted in a cable to headquarters that the site could not hold out beyond 10 March. The accuracy of his estimate burnished his reputation in the agency.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decades the {{involvement}} of <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> in the planning and evaluation of development programs has steadily increased. Ownership of development planning is propagated as major aim of bilateral and international development co-operation. Yet, the quality and performance of many <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> is still open to question, last but not least, because they share the same technocratic bias as {{quite a number of}} their Western counterparts, notably concerning pro-poor development policies, empowerment and ill-adapted technology transfer.

500|$|On May 21, 1946, {{physicist}} Louis Slotin {{and seven}} other Los Alamos personnel {{were in a}} Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a subcritical mass (core) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would {{use it in a}} final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's unapproved protocol, the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver, manipulated by the scientist's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the <b>local</b> <b>expert,</b> performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots, in front of a roomful of observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be [...] "dead within a year" [...] if they continued performing it. [...] Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".|$|E

40|$|PRINCIPLES: The {{literature}} has described opinion leaders {{not only as}} marketing tools of the pharmaceutical industry, but also as educators promoting good clinical practice. This qualitative study addresses {{the distinction between the}} opinion-leader-as-marketing-tool and the opinion-leader-as-educator, as it is revealed in the discourses of physicians and experts, focusing on the prescription of antidepressants. We explore the relational dynamic between physicians, opinion leaders and the pharmaceutical industry in an area of French-speaking Switzerland. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of 24 semistructured interviews with physicians and <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> in psychopharmacology, complemented by direct observation of educational events led by the experts, which were all sponsored by various pharmaceutical companies. RESULTS: Both physicians and experts were critical of the pharmaceutical industry and its use of opinion leaders. <b>Local</b> <b>experts,</b> in contrast, were perceived by the physicians as critical of the industry and, therefore, as a legitimate source of information. <b>Local</b> <b>experts</b> did not consider themselves opinion leaders and argued that they remained intellectually independent from the industry. Field observations confirmed that <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> criticised the industry at continuing medical education events. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Local</b> <b>experts</b> were vocal critics of the industry, which nevertheless sponsor their continuing education. This critical attitude enhanced their credibility {{in the eyes of the}} prescribing physicians. We discuss how the experts, despite their critical attitude, might still be beneficial to the industry's interests...|$|R

We examined the importance of native and exotic species and the effects of gender and age on that knowledge. We also compared data obtained from different groups of informants (<b>local</b> <b>experts</b> and general community). We conducted 194 interviews between June 2007 and January 2008, using the freelist technique and semistructured forms to collect ethnobotanical data. Information obtained from the community was compared with that from six <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> who participated in a survey in 2003. From a total of 209 ethnospecies, exotic and herbaceous plants presented higher richness. With respect to the number of citations, women and older informants were shown to know a higher number of medicinal plants. Comparing knowledge of <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> with that of the general community, we noted that experts know a similar wealth of plant families and therapeutic indications, but the community knows a greater species richness. These results indicate that <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> may provide useful information for studies that search for a quick diagnosis of the knowledge of a given community...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a divide-andcombine strategy for decomposition {{of a complex}} prediction problem into simpler local sub-problems.

Therefore, to each region is assigned a <b>local</b> predictor (or <b>expert)</b> which is trained only on local data. To construct {{a solution to the}} global prediction problem, we combine the <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> using two approaches: weighted averaging where the outputs of <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> are weighted by their prior densities, and nonlinear adaptive combination where the pooling parameters are obtained through minimization of a global error.

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîThis work {{combines}} several established regression and meta-learning {{techniques to}} give a holistic regression model and presents the proposed Learnt Topology Gating Artificial Neural Networks (LTGANN) model {{in the context of}} a general architecture previously published by the authors. The applied regression techniques are Artificial Neural Networks, which are on one hand used as <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> for the regression modelling and on the other hand as gating networks. The role of the gating networks is to estimate the prediction error of the <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> dependent on the input data samples. This is achieved by relating the input data space to the performance of the <b>local</b> <b>experts,</b> and thus building a performance map, for each of the <b>local</b> <b>experts.</b> The estimation of the prediction error is then used for the weighting of the <b>local</b> <b>experts</b> predictions. Another advantage of our approach is that the particular neural networks are unconstrained in terms of the number of hidden units. It is only necessary to define the range within which the number of hidden units has to be generated. The model links the topology to the performance, which has been achieved by the network with the given complexity, using a probabilistic approach. As the model was developed in the context of process industry data, it is evaluated using two industrial data sets. The evaluation has shown a clear advantage when using a model combination and meta-learning approach as well as demonstrating the higher performance of LTGANN when compared to a standard combination method.
