5|$|Playtex is an American {{brand name}} for undergarments, baby products, gloves, {{feminine}} products and sunscreen. The brand began in 1947, when International Latex Corporation (ILC) created a division named Playtex {{to produce and}} sell <b>latex</b> <b>products.</b> Playtex {{was the first to}} advertise undergarments on national television in 1955 and the first to show a woman wearing only a bra from the waist-up in a commercial in 1977.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor and the Japanese {{invasion}} of Malaysia cut off Allied manufacturers from their largest sources of latex. As supplies ran out and demand for consumer products fell, ILC halted production; sales would not resume until 1946. The company almost {{went out of business}} during the war, so it created an industrial division to find government and military applications for latex. Playtex was founded in 1947 as one of four divisions ILC re-organized into. Its name was a portmanteau of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "latex", reflecting its focus on <b>latex</b> <b>products.</b> Playtex's marketing in the post-war era was influential in creating the shift from custom-tailored undergarments to manufactured sizes. For example, the company introduced large floor displays with fitting charts, so women could find the right size without a custom fitting.|$|E

50|$|For some people, the {{sensitivity}} is so extreme that replacement of <b>latex</b> <b>products</b> with products made from alternative materials may still {{result in a}} reaction if the products are manufactured in the same facility as the latex-containing products, due to trace quantities of natural rubber latex on the non-latex products.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, {{food allergies}} {{can lead to}} a medical emergency, such as anaphylactic shock, {{hypotension}} (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness.

40|$|Background Natural <b>latex</b> rubber <b>products</b> {{have been}} known to cause severe anaphylactic {{reactions}} during surgery. Even 25 years after the first description of anaphylactic reactions in the literature, natural <b>latex</b> rubber <b>products</b> are still used in pediatric surgery. Case presentation The following article describes the case of a healthy 4. 5 -year old Caucasian boy who simultaneously developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and bronchospasm during surgery for congenital strabismus sursoadductorius under uneventful anesthesia. An allergy test conducted afterwards showed natural latex rubber as the trigger for this severe intraoperative anaphylactic reaction. This case was special because of the absence of any previous clinical or anamnestical evidence of natural latex rubber allergy. The fact that the child had been previously exposed to natural latex rubber – because the boy’s mother used disposable gloves for her work as a cosmetician at home – was only discovered later. Such contact may have had a slight sensitizing effect that manifested after the initial contact with the conjunctiva through the surgeon’s natural latex rubber gloves. Conclusion Natural <b>latex</b> rubber <b>products</b> have caused severe anaphylactic reactions time and again. Diagnosis is impeded by the highly variable clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, the non-responsivity of patients, anesthesia-induced changes in blood pressure, surgical drapes, and blood loss. Therefore, use of alternative products and implementation of the right course of action in clinical routine seems to be even more important than raising awareness for allergies to natural latex rubber...|$|R

40|$|Acrylic acid (AA) {{is used in}} many {{emulsion}} polymerization formulations to improve the colloidal stability of the <b>latex</b> <b>product.</b> The improved stability originates from electrostatic repulsion complemented with steric repulsion. The strength of the electrostatic and steric repulsion forces in a styrene (S) /AA copolymer latex was investigated at different pH values, electrolyte concentrations, and temperatures. A comparison was made with an S homopolymer latex. Transmission electron microscopic pictures, combined with visual inspections, provided understanding of the mechanisms leading to coagulation in polystyrene (PS) /AA copolymer latices. Colloidal stability of the unswollen sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilized PS latex is based on electrostatic repulsion. Destabilization by sodium chloride resulted in aggregation. The acidic PS/AA latex remained stable against aggregation at high electrolyte concentrations because of steric repulsion. The acidic PS/AA latex showed a strong tendency to flocculate at increasing electrolyte concentrations. Flocculation was not observed for high-pH PS/AA latices at high electrolyte concentrations. Steric repulsion of the acid PS/AA latex was lost at temperatures higher than the critical coagulation temperature (35 °C), and flocculation was followed by aggregation and coalescence. The high-pH PS/AA latex was stable even at high electrolyte concentrations and temperatures up to 80 °C because of strong electrosteric stabilization...|$|R

This paper highlights the survey results of the excess sludge generated from activated sludge treatment plants of the concentrated latex factories, including sludge generation rate, sludge characteristics, as well as sludge management and its problems. The total number of 11 factories was investigated. The findings showed that 20 % of the investigated factories using activated sludge did not know how much the excess sludge generation rate was. With an in-depth investigation, the excess sludge generation rate was determined as for 28 kg/ton concentrated <b>latex</b> <b>product</b> or 10 kg/ton of field latex used in the concentrated latex factories. The excess sludge had a low C/N ratio with an average value of 4. 7 and contained N, P, and K with the average of percentage values of 8. 0, 2. 0, and 1. 0 % dry basis, respectively. However, the excess sludge consisted of Zn with an average of 3. 01 % dry basis. 60 % of the investigated factories using an activated sludge system had issues concerning the management of excess sludge. Moreover, various aspects of the excess sludge management were discussed and lessons were learned on the current excess sludge management of the concentrated latex industry in the south of Thailand...|$|R

40|$|Rubber tree {{is known}} to be the white gold tree species in Mindanao Philippines due to its high priced <b>latex</b> <b>product.</b> It is a {{seasonal}} tree which has problems on seed propagation thus; stem cut rubber was tested for sprouting and rooting potentials as affected by stem parts and levels of alpha naphthalene acetic acid (ANAA). The experiment employed a split-split plot design in lay-out and data analysis. The results indicate that at 75 days of observation, brown stem cut rubber significantly gave higher rate of survival (74 %) as compared to 41 % in green stem cut. No ANAA (control treatment) was significantly lower in survival rate of 48. 3 % compared with 65. 8 and 58. 3 % in 1 tbsp/ 3 lit. H 2 O and 1 tbsp/ 1 lit. H 2 O, respectively with no interaction effects observed. Brown stem part significantly performed better than the young stem parts (green stem cut) as affected by the levels of ANAA. Lower concentration of ANAA (1 tbsp/ 3 lit. H 2 O) gives better sprouts and rooting potentials as compared to the control treatment and higher concentration of the growth hormone with interaction effects. This indicated that older stem part and lower level of ANAA application would mean greater potential of propagating rubber tree through stem cut technology, thus alternative propagation technology during seed off year in rubber would be addressed...|$|R

5000|$|Health care providers. Given the {{ubiquitous}} use of <b>latex</b> <b>products</b> {{in health care}} settings, management of latex allergy presents significant health organizational problems. Those healthcare workers—such as physicians, nurses, aides, dentists, dental hygienists, operating room employees, occupational therapists, laboratory technicians, and hospital housekeeping personnel—who frequently use latex gloves and other latex-containing medical supplies {{are at risk for}} developing latex allergy. Between about 4% to 17% of healthcare workers have a reaction, which usually presents as Irritant Contact Dermatitis. This contact dermatitis can develop further through allergic sensitivity to a status of full anaphylactic shock. Apart from the uncomfortable and in some cases life-threatening health implications, this will effectively hinder the person from working with any amount of latex and could impede their chance of maintaining their vocation. In the surgical setting, the risk of a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction by a patient has been deemed by Johns Hopkins Hospital to be sufficiently high to replace all latex surgical gloves with synthetic alternatives.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of budget}} limitations, initial M1918A2 {{production}} consisted of conversions of older M1918 BARs (remaining in surplus) {{along with a}} limited number of M1922s and M1918A1s. After the outbreak of war, attempts to ramp up new M1918A2 production were stymied by the discovery that the World War I tooling used to produce the M1918 was either worn out or incompatible with modern production machinery. New production was first undertaken at the New England Small Arms Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. (a total of 188,380 new weapons were manufactured). In 1942, a shortage of black walnut for buttstocks and grips {{led to the development of}} a black plastic buttstock for the BAR.

40|$|Objectives: Exposure to latex allergens in {{latex gloves}} can cause {{occupational}} health problems in nurses, yet latex gloves are still {{widely used in}} Thai hospitals. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine the prevalence of latex sensitization in nurses and identify risk factors associated with sensitization. Methods: A questionnaire, providing information on personal characteristics, ill-health, working conditions and symptoms related to <b>latex</b> <b>product</b> use, was administered to 363 female nurses working in two tertiary hospitals in southern Thailand. Latex sensitization was confirmed using a solid phase immunoassay to detect anti-latex IgE antibodies. Total glove protein levels were determined by using a modified Lowry method and latex aeroallergens by a competitive inhibition immunoassay. Results: The overall prevalence of latex sensitization was 4. 4 %. Respiratory symptoms related to latex glove use {{were significantly associated with}} latex sensitization (OR = 5. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 57 - 19). Total glove protein levels ranged 87. 8 - 250. 8 μg protein/dm 2. The prevalence of latex sensiti- zation was higher (6. 6 % vs. 2. 2 %) in the hospital where gloves with higher protein levels (82 - 438 μg/g vs. 86 - 170 μg/g) were used. Furthermore, latex sensitization prevalence increased from 3 % to 5 % with increased average departmental aeroallergen concentrations. Conclusions: Latex sensitization prevalence in Thai nurses was higher than previously reported. Respiratory exposure seems to play an important role, in addition to dermal exposure. If latex gloves cannot be replaced by non-latex alternatives, replacement with gloves with lower protein content should be considered...|$|R
