5000|$|... "Agricultural practices" [...] - Destructive {{agricultural}} {{practices such as}} overuse of fertilizers and overgrazing <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation. The soil gets eroded, and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in desertification of the land. Apart from land degradation, water pollution is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can run-off into rivers and contaminate the water.|$|E

5000|$|David Johnstone, {{chairman}} of Scottish Land and Estates, said the proposal could <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> not being {{made available to}} let, and hurting the tenant farming sector. Johnstone said: “What you are doing is giving a tenant {{a stake in the}} capital value of the farm. If the landlord doesn’t have the ability to pay, then the farm never comes back... That has got to have a knock on effect in the confidence of anyone who might wish to come to let land or is letting land at the moment.” ...|$|E
5000|$|SLM {{is defined}} as a {{knowledge-based}} procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods. SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growingpopulation. Improper land management can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, hydrology, carbon sequestration) functions of watersheds and landscapes." [...] The World Bank [...] The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) applies the term in a much wider context.

5000|$|Land {{development}} puts {{more emphasis}} on the expected economic development {{as a result of}} the process; [...] "land conversion" [...] tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the land use change. [...] "Land improvement" [...] in the economic sense can often <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation from the ecological perspective. Land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area. While conversion of (rural) land with a vegetation carpet to building land may result in a rise in economic growth and rising land prices, the irreversibility of lost flora and fauna because of habitat destruction, the loss of ecosystem services and resulting decline in environmental value is only considered a priori in environmental full-cost accounting.|$|E

50|$|After the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain and the United States {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris (1783), which ceded to the Americans {{a large portion}} of land in North America, {{including}} present-day Indiana, but the native tribes who occupied the land argued that they had not been represented in the treaty negotiations and ignored its terms. Further negotiations were held to establish compensation for the loss of tribal lands, while American military expeditions were called to control Indian resistance. An Indian confederacy waged war against the Americans, but the confederacy was defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), {{at the conclusion of the}} Northwest Indian War. With the loss of British military support and supplies after their withdrawal from the Northwest Territory, the defeat was a turning point that <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> cessions and the eventual removal of most the Native Americans from present-day Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Pest {{animals have}} also been {{recognized}} as {{a serious threat to}} the parklands. Habitat and food resources are taken by pest rodents such as rats, rabbits and mice. These species also <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation and erosion as they are ground dwelling fauna. This damage to grassland and wetland ecosystems leads to further opportunities for the spread of exotic plant species that prefer disturbed soils. Native wildlife are preyed upon by feral and domestic cats, dogs as well as foxes. Feral cats and foxes also negatively impact on shorebird populations especially when species are roosting or are flightless. There are also marine and intertidal pest species present at the coastal park. The Sabellid Fan Worm (Sabella spallanzanii) and the Northern Pacific Sea Star (Asterias amurensis) both reside along the western shoreline of Port Phillip Bay and are very successful at spreading and out-competing native species.|$|E
50|$|When the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad, an LIRR {{subsidiary}} built Saint James Railroad Station further south, {{there was}} some concern it would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> speculators and rampant suburban sprawl. This never took place, and instead attracted various celebrities to the community, {{as well as to}} the store. The old store ledgers have been said to contain such names as silent film actor and playwright Willie Collier, former New York City Mayor William Jay Gaynor, architect Stanford White, Frank McNish, Lionel Barrymore, Virginia Lee and Joe Flynn. Later these early stars and personalities were followed by others such as Ethel and John Barrymore, Lillian Russell, Maud Adams, Buster Keaton, Myrna Loy, Ruth Roman, Irving Berlin and Heavyweight Champion James J. Corbett. At the turn of the century, the store was inherited by Ebenezer's son Everett. Everett Smith died in 1940, and the store was taken over by his father-in-law Karl Ericson, who continued to operate it until he was 90 years old.|$|E

Furthermore, these activities provide motivation for new missions to yet unvisited types of primitive bodies, {{which has led to}} NASA’s selection of the Psyche mission for rendezvous with a metallic core (Elkins-Tanton et al. 2016) and the Lucy mission for multiple flybys of Trojan asteroids (Levison et al. 2016), and will hopefully <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>landing</b> on a Trojan asteroid in a future mission (Okada et al. 2017).|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1980s, Australian states (who {{under the}} Constitution {{have control of}} {{environmental}} and land use issues) started progressively implementing more rigid planning laws that regulated the use of land. Planning laws often concentrated, after the 1990s, on restricting greenfield development in favour of [...] "urban densification", or infill development. Land rationing is a system of banning development in all but designated areas, {{and can lead to}} extreme land price inflation if insufficient land is designated as allowed to be developed. The restrictive planning laws in Australia have used land rationing systems as part of the goal of restricting greenfield development in favour of infill development, but this inevitably <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> prices, and thus house prices, rising significantly. There is good evidence to suggest that the price of a new unit of housing is the ultimate anchor of all housing in an area, so when planning laws that implemented land rationing severely drove up the cost of new homes, all other homes followed suit.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{ground water}} pumping and aquifer {{depletion}} will <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> sinking and permanent loss of groundwater storage. Decreasing groundwater levels lead to exposing of underground water storage areas, this will cause lack of soil structure strength and possible sinking if the land above is heavy enough. This {{has already begun}} {{in certain parts of}} the state during the most recent drought. In coastal communities, excessive water pumping can lead to sea water intrusion, which means sea water will begin to flow into the underground water storage areas that were vacated by excess pumping. This can cause decreased water quality and lead to an expensive desalination effort to clean the water before distribution. Water flows through wildlife refuges and national parks can decrease or stop all together due to the decrease of surface and groundwater, the California Water Science Center is a part of a team trying to restore and maintain water flow in these at risk areas. With reduction of water flow and increased windy or dry weather, wildfire risks increase; lightning strikes or accidental human mistake can lead to huge wildfires due to the drier-than-normal climate.|$|E

40|$|Land {{degradation}} is {{a complex}} process which involves both the natural ecosystem and the socioeconomic system, among which climate and land use changes are the two predominant driving factors. To comprehensively and quantitatively analyze the land degradation process, this paper employed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy to assess land degradation and further applied the binary panel logit regression model to analyze the impacts of the driving factors on land degradation in the North China Plain. The results revealed that an increase in rainfall and temperature would significantly and positively contribute to the land improvement, and conversion from cultivated land to grassland and forest land showed positive relationship with land improvement, while conversion to built-up area will <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation. Besides, human agricultural intensification represented by fertilizer utilization will help to improve the land quality. The economic development may exert positive impacts on land quality to alleviate land degradation, although the rural economic development and agricultural production will exert negative impacts on the land and <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> degradation. Infrastructure construction would modify the land surface and further resulted in land degradation.
