After opening the envelope, Beatty hesitated to {{announce}} the winner, eventually showing it to Dunaway, who glanced at it and declared La La Land the winner. However, more than two minutes later, as the producers of La La Land were making their acceptance speeches, Oscar crew members came on stage and took the envelopes from those assembled, explaining to them {{that there had been}} a mistake.

2500|$|The ongoing {{bond between}} the two series was {{eventually}} cut in 1986, as the tenth-season premiere of Dallas declared Bobby's death the previous year had been a dream. Bobby's death had had some influence on the Knots Landing storylines as well, with Gary grieving for his dead brother while Gary's wife Abby, who had lost her brother Sid a few years earlier, consoled him. Abby and Greg Sumner then took advantage of Gary's grief and Gary's journey to Dallas for Bobby's funeral to gain politically at Empire Valley. Val also named her and Gary's son [...] "Bobby" [...] in memory of his late Uncle. Unlike the Dallas <b>producers,</b> the Knots <b>Landing</b> <b>producers</b> were not prepared to reset their series, resulting in the Knots <b>Landing</b> <b>producers</b> cutting off their show's links with Dallas. As a result, there were no further crossover episodes or storylines. Bobby's return was simply never addressed on Knots Landing, nor was he mentioned again. Shackelford and Van Ark did however reprise their roles for the Dallas series finale in 1991, which showed {{what would have happened}} to their characters if J.R. had never existed.|$|R
50|$|Beatty {{was then}} given the correct opened {{envelope}} as La La <b>Land</b> <b>producer</b> Jordan Horowitz {{stepped to the}} microphone, announced the error, stated that Moonlight had actually won the award, and took the card bearing the film's title from Beatty's hand {{and showed it to}} the camera and the audience as proof. Horowitz would later be praised for his professional handling of the situation. Beatty returned to the microphone and explained that the envelope he had initially been given named Emma Stone for her performance in La La Land, hence his confused pause, and confirmed that Moonlight was the winner. The producers of Moonlight then came onstage, Horowitz presented the Best Picture award given to him to them, and they gave their acceptance speeches.|$|E

40|$|Reducing crop {{insurance}} program vulnerabilities {{is important to}} the welfare of Texas cotton producers because excessive losses due to the abuse of these vulnerabilities may result in {{crop insurance}} premium increases. This study analyzes the added <b>land</b> and new <b>producer</b> provisions in crop insurance and evaluates whether these provisions are vulnerable to abuse. The vul-nerability of the added <b>land</b> and new <b>producer</b> provisions primarily stems from the informational advantage held by the pro-ducer with regards to the inherent productive capacity of his land. A descriptive analysis of data from insured Texas cotton producers showed statistically higher indemnity-to-premium (IP) ratios for producers utilizing the added land and new pro-ducer provisions, compared to producers using actual production history. This result suggests that the added <b>land</b> and new <b>producer</b> provisions are vulnerable to abuse and {{there is a need for}} policy makers to reassess these provisions. Several policy options are suggested in this paper to help ameliorate the vulnerability of the added <b>land</b> and new <b>producer</b> provisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} problematize {{the role of}} local food systems within the food {{sovereignty}} movement and as a counter to {{the logic of the}} global industrial food system. It answers the question of how food sovereignty, via its tenet of local food systems, addresses the geographical and sectoral distances in the global food system. In doing this, it utilizes an approach loosely based on Chayanovian thinking and analytical tools provided through food regime analysis, the theory of uneven geographical development and the metabolic rift. The paper explores six forms of distance in the industrial food system – production from consumption, distant markets, peasants from their <b>land,</b> <b>producers</b> from consumers, the rural-urban divide and agriculture from nature. Then the paper situates local food systems within food sovereignty and food sovereignty within the wider transnational agrarian movements from which it emerged. Next the paper differentiates local food systems by scale, method and character. Finally, it illustrates how and to what extent food sovereignty counters these distances by evaluating the abilities and gaps of food sovereignty in relation to the various forms of distance...|$|R

50|$|Another {{environmental}} factor {{that would be}} improved would be the amount of land left for wildlife. Crops modified to be resistant to abiotic stress and other factors that decrease yields would require less <b>land</b> use. <b>Producers</b> {{would be able to}} grow enough crops on less acres if the plants were modified to produce very high yields. This would allow some of the cropland that is in use today to be set aside for wildlife. Instead of farming “fence line to fence line” farmers would be able to create large buffers in their fields. These buffers would provide a great habitat for plants and animals.|$|R

50|$|Super Mario <b>Lands</b> <b>producer,</b> Gunpei Yokoi, {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the feeling of 1985's Super Mario Bros., only set in a separate world to the Mushroom Kingdom. This world would be Sarasaland (sometimes styled Sarasa Land), and Daisy would be its princess. However, later games mention that she now resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, and Sarasaland is only hinted in Daisy's quotes and biographies for subsequent games. Her early design looked more similar to Princess Peach, except with orange-brown, titian hair instead of yellow hair, a yellow gown with short puffy sleeves, white frills, orange high heels, a daisy-shaped brooch, crown and earrings, and wrist-length white evening gloves. In 2000's Mario Tennis, she appeared in game artwork with long hair like Pauline, and retained her flower brooch and earrings. She also had a slightly darker skin tone. This design endured until 2002's Mario Party 4, {{in which she was}} given her current design which distinguished Daisy further from Peach by depicting her with different physical traits, such as a flip hairstyle and light skin, yet with her gown design and crown color being more consistent with Peach's. In her first appearance, Daisy was described as a tomboy, a trait which has maintained throughout the games, with Daisy being depicted as a more cheerful and boastful character than Peach. In Mario sports games, she wears more athletic outfits instead of her usual gown, her color scheme normally being yellow and orange. Her special abilities are often based around flowers, with the daisy flower being her namesake.|$|R
