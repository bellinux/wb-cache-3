5|$|In The Battle of the <b>Labyrinth,</b> Annabeth and Percy find an {{entrance}} into the <b>Labyrinth</b> during a game of capture the flag. Percy soon learns that Luke had used the entrance and will lead his army through the <b>Labyrinth</b> straight in {{to the heart of}} camp. To get into the <b>Labyrinth,</b> Percy has to find the symbol of Daedalus, the Greek letter delta, (Δ) on a passageway, touch it, and then enter the <b>Labyrinth.</b> Using the <b>Labyrinth,</b> Percy tries to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion.|$|E
5|$|Daedalus– A {{brilliant}} architect, Daedalus {{constructed the}} <b>labyrinth</b> in which Pandora was imprisoned after Zeus discovered her existence. Zeus also promised to reunite Daedelus {{with his son}} Icarus as a reward, but never revealed that Icarus was already dead. Kratos encountered Daedalus hanging {{in a part of}} the <b>labyrinth</b> and the architect revealed that the <b>labyrinth</b> must be united to free Pandora. Daedelus was killed when Kratos united the <b>labyrinth</b> and left a message in blood encouraging Kratos to get even with Zeus for him. The character was voiced by Malcolm McDowell in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> {{was first}} {{released}} on home video in 1987 by Embassy Home Entertainment in the US and by Channel 5 Video Distribution in the UK.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} {{the designs of}} {{a select group of}} <b>labyrinths</b> set into the pavements of Gothic churches in northern France. The designs of these <b>labyrinths</b> and their possible meanings and functions were examined. Existing information on the <b>labyrinths,</b> including oral traditions associated with them were considered. A study of earlier medieval church <b>labyrinths</b> and illustrations of <b>labyrinths</b> in medieval manuscripts was made. In addition, medieval philosophy and history were considered. The various meanings and functions scholars have proposed for the <b>labyrinths</b> were critically reviewed. It was possible to draw some conclusions as to the labyrinths' original meanings and their functions and to trace the evolution of these meanings and functions during the Middle Ages...|$|R

50|$|One {{can think}} of <b>labyrinths</b> as {{symbolic}} of pilgrimage; people can walk the path, ascending toward salvation or enlightenment. Many people {{could not afford to}} travel to holy sites and lands, so <b>labyrinths</b> and prayer substituted for such travel. Later, the religious significance of <b>labyrinths</b> faded, and they served primarily for entertainment, though recently their spiritual aspect has seen a resurgence. Author Ben Radford conducted an investigation into some of the claims of spiritual and healing effects of <b>labyrinths,</b> reporting on his findings in his book Mysterious New Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the same}} general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical <b>labyrinths</b> were {{constructed}} in Scandinavia. These <b>labyrinths,</b> generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as [...] "Troy Town". They {{are thought to have}} been constructed by fishing communities: trapping malevolent trolls or winds in the <b>labyrinth's</b> coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone <b>labyrinths</b> on the Isles of Scilly, although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.|$|R
5|$|Since initial release, <b>Labyrinth</b> {{has been}} {{translated}} to {{other forms of}} media. The film was novelized by A. C. H. Smith as Labyrinth: A Novel Based On The Jim Henson Film, which is currently out of print. Along with The Dark Crystal, Archaia Publishing reprinted <b>Labyrinth</b> with illustrations in 2014. A three-issue comic book adaptation, which was first released in a single volume as Marvel Super Special #40, was published by Marvel Comics. Tokyopop, in partnership with The Jim Henson Company, published a manga-style four-volume comic called Return to <b>Labyrinth,</b> written by Jake T. Forbes and illustrated by Chris Lie, with cover art by Kouyu Shurei. Return to <b>Labyrinth</b> follows the adventures of Toby as a teenager, when he is tricked into returning to the <b>Labyrinth</b> by Jareth. The first volume was released August 8, 2006, with a second following on October 9, 2007 and a third on May 1, 2009. In an afterword to the second volume, editor Tim Beedle announced that the series, originally planned as a trilogy, was being extended to include a fourth volume. The fourth and final volume of Return to <b>Labyrinth</b> was released on August 3, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The bony <b>labyrinth</b> {{refers to}} the bony {{compartment}} which contains the membranous <b>labyrinth,</b> contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous <b>labyrinth.</b> The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|At least twenty-five {{treatments}} and scripts were drafted for <b>Labyrinth</b> between 1983–85, and the film's shooting script was only ready shortly before filming began.|$|E
5000|$|The stone <b>labyrinths</b> of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island are a {{group of}} 13 or 14 <b>labyrinths</b> on Bolshoi Zayatsky Island, one of the Solovetsky Islands in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Lacking {{standard}} archaeological study, a research group from St. Petersberg theorize that the <b>labyrinths</b> are about 2500 years old, according to their orientation, their supposed ritual use, {{and changes in the}} direction of the zenith on the solstice throughout history.|$|R
50|$|Celtic <b>labyrinths</b> {{are found}} among carvings at Camonica Valley, {{occupied}} by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one Knossos or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the <b>labyrinths</b> also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the <b>labyrinths</b> containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity Cernunnos. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as {{the line of the}} other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing Classical <b>labyrinths</b> from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.|$|R
50|$|As well as 13 or 14 <b>labyrinths,</b> {{there are}} more than 850 heaps of {{boulders}} on Bolshoi Zayatsky Island, plus numerous other stone settings such as a stone symbol with radial spokes, possibly representing the sun. All the <b>labyrinths</b> are concentrated in an area of 0.4 km2 on {{the western part of the}} island. Another enormous complex of stone settings on Sopka Hill, in the eastern part of the island, does not include any <b>labyrinths.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> was {{the first}} {{adventure}} game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by designer David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based adventure games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. <b>Labyrinth</b> received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent adventure title, the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{determine}} whether the practice of using a graded series of <b>labyrinths</b> affect their final solution, hence the orientation in the plane, check the level of understanding of <b>labyrinths</b> and determine whether the sex of children affect the resulting solution. Thus, the work environment uses of <b>labyrinths</b> to develop a structured orientation in a limited space for pre-school children aged five to six (seven) years. The theoretical part characterizes preschool child and explains the context pre- mathematical literacy and orientation in space/plane with the delegation on labyrinthsurthermore, the <b>labyrinths</b> of focus in terms of historical, semantic and didactic. Furthermore, the <b>labyrinths</b> of focus in terms of historical, semantic and didactic. The practical part describes research which in obtaining information from the set of samples used structured observations and findings to the final results of the comparative analysis. They are discussed in connection with: the needs of the child and their saturation; orientation in space/plane; problem situation; interactions of teachers and children.

5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a fast travel system; the Junk Shop, which acts as a vendor for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded for rare items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala <b>Labyrinth,</b> accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The <b>Labyrinth</b> is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the <b>Labyrinth</b> requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony <b>labyrinth.</b> A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous <b>labyrinth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the <b>labyrinth</b> before they {{could get to the}} end of the game.

50|$|There {{are also}} similar <b>labyrinths</b> in {{northern}} continental Europe. Their paths are outlined with stones (unlike the turf-cut mazes of England, {{and those that}} formerly existed in Denmark). Stone-lined <b>labyrinths</b> such as these have proved slightly easier to date than turf mazes (which have to be cleaned out regularly to keep their paths clear, thus destroying any archaeological evidence). The stone <b>labyrinths</b> around the Baltic coast have been dated to between the 13th century and modern times, with a peak in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|R

5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the <b>Labyrinth</b> and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's <b>Labyrinth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. <b>Labyrinth</b> fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a <b>labyrinth</b> organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling <b>labyrinth</b> organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
