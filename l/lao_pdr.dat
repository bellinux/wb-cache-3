25|$|In May 2011, {{the debate}} over Nestlé's {{unethical}} marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written {{an open letter to}} the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, Bureau Veritas was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina’s compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR</b> Decree in <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR.</b> The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a non-conformance, and Bureau Veritas recommended that the Nestlé’s Policy and Procedures Manual on the Marketing of breastmilk substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR</b> Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization {{was in the process of}} developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.|$|E

Due to the vastly contrasting situations {{between the two countries}} in terms of healthcare supply, and considering Laotians’ increasing demand for high quality health care, a number of them have managed to satisfy their needs by combining cross-border treatment {{with the use of the}} healthcare facilities provided by their own country. This study consisted first of household surveys conducted in five border areas (2006 - 2007) in Laos in order to quantify and map out cross-border healthcare-related travel patterns. Afterwards, interviews were conducted with cross-border patients (55), Laotian and Thai medical doctors (6), Thai social workers (5), and officials working in public institutions (12). While socioeconomic and spatial factors partly explain cross-border mobility, patients’ social networks significantly influence treatment itineraries throughout the decision-making process, including logistical and financial considerations. The social networks existing at different geographical levels (neighbourhood, regional and global) are therefore a powerful analytical tool not only for understanding the emergence of these cross-border movements but also for justifying them in an authoritarian political environment such as <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR’s...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} the process {{involved in a}} case of sustainable forest and wetland management. It analyzes the type and extent of decentralization that is practiced in Pathoumphone district (Champassack province in Southern Laos) together with the development of two local institutions and the legal framework related to this development. The Mak Jong management group (MJG) and the District Field Wetland Management team (DFWMT) were created {{due to the lack of}} a management system, a continuous decline in Mak Jong (MJ) trees and an increase in the number of conflicts over the use of wetland resources (IUCN, 2008). The MJG came about as the result of a request from local authorities and communities, while the DFWMT resulted from an official request following the <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR's</b> accession to the Ramsar Convention. Villagers strongly represented themselves through both groups at the local level and took actions to ensure the governance of natural resources as their area of responsibility, complied with their agreements and followed the legal framework, including the mechanisms for sharing profits and benefits among themselves and their village units. Transferring rights to local communities and institutions over forests and wetlands are the most significant efforts to conserve and rehabilitate forests and wetlands, while simultaneously being able to provide local communities with ownership of their areas together with the opportunity to engage in economic activities, such as agriculture, livestock and ecotourism. Decentralization regarding the natural resources in this district has not yet been fully implemented, however, as can be seen from the absence of the role and rights of local people in the current policy framework, and both the villagers and the local authorities are still concerned about the long-term viability of the MJG and DFWMT, as there has not yet been a complete transfer of power. Therefore, decentralization regarding natural resources should be taken into account by both the central and local governments and a compromise reached in order to meet both the needs and priorities of the local people and the government's interests in meeting government commitments and achieving national targets...|$|R

[...] The panel was concerned with what they measured to be the significantly deteriorating living standard of the inhabits of the NNT Conservation and the Nakai Plateau and the NNT Conservation Area. They also pointed to the area’s deteriorating environment and biodiversity. In the Naki Plateau, the POE estimated that 50 {{percent of the people}} were below the <b>Lao</b> <b>PDR's</b> poverty line. Furthermore, the poor in these areas were increasingly reliant on food relief due to crop failures. They also had no access to medical facilities. Intensifying these problems, the population growth rate was nearing three percent. The POE attributes many of these problems to the declining populations of natural predators in the ecosystem due to overhunting by the indigenous people and foreign poachers. These opinions are grounded with correlational evidence that shows a sharp increase of insects and rodents that intensified the famines and diseases in the area. The POE also found four indigenous cultures: the Atel, the Themarou, the Mlengbrou, and the Ahoe that would become extinct by the early 21st century without foreign intervention. The POE believed that a wider range of economic opportunities created by the project would provide members of these cultures with the means of survival and an escape from poverty. The POE was also swayed by the commitment of the consortium (NTEC) to improve the living standards of impacted people beyond the standards required by the World Bank. Its involvement in the drafting of a national resettlement policy for development projects would help the Nam Theun 2 project become a model for future development projects both in Laos {{and the rest of the}} world.
