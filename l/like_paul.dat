25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other sauropods, brachiosaurids had an inclined back, {{due to their}} long forelimbs. Therefore, if the neck exited the body in a straight line, it already pointed upwards. The exact angle is influenced by how the pectoral girdle is reconstructed, {{that is how the}} shoulder blades are placed on the ribcage. The mobility of the neck was reconstructed as quite low by Stevens and Parrish, while other researchers <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> and Christian and Dzemski argued for more flexible necks.|$|E

These meetings also functioned as reunions for political activists and intellectuals, some of whom worked together for decades. SDUSA also published a newsletter and occasional position papers.|$|E

25|$|As the 16th {{century was}} passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a {{predominant}} school of thought; and figures <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian {{taught at the}} university. It attracted scholars {{from all over the}} continent and developed into a cultural and academic center. However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies, {{and other}} devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never {{completely}} {{gave up trying to}} balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941 the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects for the first time were felt in 1933, and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Krugman the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run {{as it was in the}} long run.|$|E
25|$|His guitar playing {{style is}} {{characterized}} by complicated heavy metal riffs executed at great speed and with extreme precision, often using alternate picking technique and little vibrato. His compositions are usually filled with melodies and hooks, {{in order to make}} well-constructed songs, instead of long neo-classical themes like some of his peers do. His shred guitar work has attracted many fans over the world and his musicianship has often been compared to the ability of guitarists of his age <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Kirk Hammett, David T. Chastain and others. In 1986 he declared that the main influences for his compositions and guitar solos came from the work of Deep Purple’s guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and from Japanese music for koto.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Scottish Member of Parliament John Mackinnon Robertson {{argued that}} Jesus never existed, but was an {{invention}} by a first-century messianic cult. In Robertson's view, religious groups invent new gods {{to fit the}} needs of the society of the time. Robertson argued that a solar deity symbolized by the lamb and the ram had long been worshiped by an Israelite cult of Joshua and that this cult had then invented a new messianic figure, Jesus of Nazareth. Robertson argued that a possible source for the Christian myth may have been the Talmudic story of the executed Jesus Pandera which dates to 100 BCE. Robertson considered the letters of Paul the earliest surviving Christian writings, but viewed them as primarily concerned with theology and morality, rather than historical details. Robertson viewed references to the twelve apostles and the institution of the Eucharist as stories that must have developed later among gentile believers who were converted by Jewish evangelists <b>like</b> <b>Paul.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike the king, Frederick was a {{knowledgeable}} amateur of painting, who patronised immigrant artists like Jacopo Amigoni and Jean Baptiste Vanloo, who painted the {{portraits of the}} prince and his consort for Frederick's champion William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. The list of other artists he employed—Philip Mercier, John Wootton, George Knapton and the French engraver Joseph Goupy—represents some of the principal painterly figures of the English Rococo. The Prince was also crucially important for furthering {{the popularity of the}} Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen, patronising silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), toyshop owners <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Bertrand and carver and gilders, the most notable being Paul Petit (1729–c.1756) who first worked for the prince on William Kent's neo-Palladian state barge of 1732, which is still preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick that are among the most significant remaining testaments to his patronage of the decorative arts. One frame made for his namesake cousin in 1748, Frederick the Great of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the Prince held his cousin, suggesting the Prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, over that of his own father George II. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by Antoine Pense, and remains today in the British Royal Collection.|$|E
25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

500|$|When storylines {{for certain}} {{characters}} become tired, the scriptwriters simply move one family out {{and replace it}} with a new one. Ramsay Street is now a mixture of older characters <b>like</b> <b>Paul</b> Robinson (Stefan Dennis), Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), [...] Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), [...] and Karl (Alan Fletcher) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), as well as newer characters such as the Canning and Brennan families. Watson originally wanted to show young people communicating with older people, which means that the cast is a mix of young actors in their teens or early 20s and older, more experienced hands. The last remaining original character, Helen Daniels, departed the show in 1997 due to the ill-health of Anne Haddy. In 2004, original cast member Stefan Dennis returned to Neighbours full-time as Paul Robinson. Paul is currently the only remaining original character in the series. In February 2009, it was announced that producers would be introducing a new generation of the Ramsay family to the show, over a decade after the family had last appeared. Kate (Ashleigh Brewer), Harry (Will Moore) and Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) made their first appearances in May 2009. Later that year, actor James Mason was cast in the role of Chris Pappas, who became the first prominent, ongoing gay male character in the show's history. He was the second ongoing gay character overall, following recurring character Lana Crawford's (Bridget Neval) introduction in 2004.|$|E
