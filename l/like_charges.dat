500|$|An {{argument}} by Freeman Dyson {{shows that}} the radius of convergence of the perturbation series in QED is zero. The basic argument goes as follows: if the coupling constant were negative, this would be equivalent to the Coulomb force constant being negative. This would [...] "reverse" [...] the electromagnetic interaction so that <b>like</b> <b>charges</b> would attract and unlike charges would repel. This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons {{on one side of}} the universe and a cluster of positrons on the other side of the universe. Because the theory is 'sick' for any negative value of the coupling constant, the series do not converge, but are an asymptotic series.|$|E

2500|$|Electric {{charge is}} the {{physical}} property of matter that causes it {{to experience a}} force when placed in an electromagnetic field.

An absence of net charge is referred to as [...] An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.|$|E

The numerical results show that close to the charged surface the ions are oriented parallel to the surface, whereas at distances greater than half of the ion length, they are randomly oriented. Due to the restriction of the orientational degrees of freedom, the density of ions at the charged surface decreases to zero.
