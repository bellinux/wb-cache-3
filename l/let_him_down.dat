5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
25|$|Moriani is able {{to enter}} a secret passage in the hills leading into the Castle. In an {{underground}} labyrinth, he encounters Pekmester, who explains Florescu is a servant of Dracula. He went {{to see her in}} the dispensary hoping she would lead him to Dracula, but Dracula knocked him out, put him in the coffin and he woke up in the labyrinth. Eventually, Moriani enters the catacombs. Von Krüger arrives in the courtyard above, begging Moriani to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> but Moriani refuses. Florescu arrives, and reveals she is/was Calugarul. When she followed The Path with the intention of killing Dracula, he offered her immortality and her beauty back, and she accepted. She explains Pekmester killed both Luca and Boczow, and von Krüger {{is the head of the}} Thule Society, who wish for another World War. She wishes Moriani luck as Dracula himself approaches. However, Moriani ignites the bomb he disarmed at the inn, and the catacombs are destroyed. As Moriani dies, Pekmester laments they have lost their chance, but von Krüger assures him they will return. Unseen by any of them, a green vapour rises from the rubble into the air.|$|E
25|$|Hussey's cricketing prowess {{was perhaps}} first widely {{acknowledged}} after an innings for the Victorian Bushrangers in 2003–04, {{his first full}} season of first-class cricket. Hussey scored 212 not out as his side scored a record 455/7 in the 4th innings to beat New South Wales in Newcastle. He finished the Australian season with an aggregate 857 runs {{at an average of}} 61. In 2004–05 his four-day form <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> and he was dropped from the Victorian Pura Cup side. Hussey unsuccessfully asked Cricket Victoria for a release to return to Western Australia. Another modest Pura Cup season for Victoria in 2005–06 saw him make 500 runs at an average of just over 30. It was again in the one day arena where he impressed as he smashed 535 runs at 76.42. This tally included 130 against Queensland and he won the state's limited-overs player-of-the-year award. In 2006–07 he repeated his Newcastle heroics with another match winning unbeaten century to beat NSW in the 4th innings. Captaining the side in the absence of Cameron White and Brad Hodge, Hussey finished with 125 as his side made 362 for 7 chasing 360 for victory. The winning runs came from his bat with a 6 off Stuart MacGill. It took his first thousand-run season in 2007–08 (he made 1,008 in the Pura Cup at 56) before he was finally chosen for a tour, the ODI series in the West Indies in 2008, and earned his first Cricket Australia contract. In February 2008 Hussey made the second fastest Australian domestic one-day hundred, off 60 balls. Hussey played as a Twenty20 allrounder, bowling in all Victoria's matches with success (a wicket in all but one game and leaving him with 10 for the tournament). In 2007–08 Hussey was named Victoria's Player of the Year in all three domestic cricket formats.|$|E

25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
500|$|Author Ian Inglis interprets [...] "Far East Man" [...] {{as being}} about Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, for whom Harrison had staged the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Three years later, {{with the new}} nation of Bangladesh still beset by problems, and {{conflict}} clouding the issue of friendship generally for Harrison, Inglis suggests that [...] "this is one friendship [...] is determined to preserve". The choruses therefore promise: [...] "I won't <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> ... I won't let him drown ..." [...] Harrison later credited Shankar with being [...] "probably {{the person who has}} influenced my life the most", since [...] "Indian music was like a stepping-stone to the spiritual path". Inglis views the song as reflecting Harrison's commitment to [...] "all the things that India has given him".|$|E
500|$|For Diệm and his family, {{the failed}} coup {{was a turning}} point in {{relations}} with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin [...] "We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; we felt we could count on it, just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee." [...] Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were [...] "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".|$|E

500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, and I was glad that he asked." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no party}} {{organisation}} and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature {{was a single}} sheet with the message [...] "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, {{it was clear that}} he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as [...] "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an unofficial strike at the local Hoover factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation. Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he had never thought for a moment would <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate. The national leadership refused his request for an official inquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party, in the selection process and during the election itself.|$|E

2500|$|In a later {{report to}} Robertson (24 Dec) Haig {{accepted}} the blame, {{stating that the}} troops had been tired {{as a result of}} the attack on Bourlon Wood which he had ordered. Esher had warned Haig (28 October) that Rawlinson was criticising Charteris (known as [...] "the Principal Boy"), and reported that he had told Rawlinson that Charteris had [...] "no influence" [...] over Haig and his information had never <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Derby warned Haig (7 December) to sack Charteris, as the War Cabinet and General Staff were displeased at his exaggerated claims of German weakness. Haig took responsibility and defended Charteris. After the battle, the press baron Lord Northcliffe reduced his support of Haig. He had recently been offended on a visit to GHQ, when Haig had been too busy to pay much attention to him. A Times editorial [...] "A Case for Inquiry" [...] (12 Dec) criticised Charteris for his [...] "fatuous estimates" [...] of German losses and morale and called for the sacking of [...] "every blunderer" [...] at GHQ.

2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when {{the clock is}} ticking and time is pressing, a player's intuition is most likely to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E

2500|$|Further north, {{protecting}} the other flank of MacDonald's column lay the fresh Guard Cavalry Division, which also received MacDonald's invitation to charge, but remained motionless, with its commander, Général de Division Walther, invoking {{a lack of}} orders from his direct commanders, either Napoleon or Maréchal Bessières. The Emperor {{was too far away}} from the action and Bessières had been wounded during his earlier cavalry charge and had been carried away from the battlefield, so the Horse Guards did not move. Towards 14:00, MacDonald's attack had ground to a halt and the opportunity to completely break the Austrian line in this sector came to nothing. Napoleon noted with disgust that {{it was the first time}} that the cavalry <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> but, given the state of exhaustion and the losses sustained by the French forces, MacDonald would have probably been unable to follow up any breakthrough achieved by the cavalry anyway. Still, the resolutely led attack achieved Napoleon's main strategic goal, which was to pin down the Austrian forces in this sector, preventing Charles from reinforcing his battered left. Forced to concede that his attack had lost momentum, MacDonald did his best to shelter his remaining men from the enemy's intense cannonade. However, reinforcements were not far away: the Emperor sent in support Wrede's powerful Bavarian division, 5,500 men strong, as well as the elite Chasseurs à Cheval and Chevau-légers regiments of the Imperial Guard, as well as the Saxon cavalry. The Bavarian division quickly came up in support but exchanged fire with the enemy only briefly and it was solely the artillery that really came into action, as the Austrians were by now in full retreat. Behind the Bavarians came the Fusiliers of the [...] "Young Guard", four battalion-strong, which were led by the Emperor's aide-de-camp, General Reille, with strict orders to avoid [...] "getting involved in any adventure". [...] With the support of the Guard, the Bavarians captured Süssenbrunn and they alone continued the pursuit beyond this village. The Guard Chasseurs à Cheval tried to halt the advance of the enemy but they were met by Liechtenstein's Austrian cavalry and, receiving no support from their fellow Chevau-légers, they had to withdraw, coming away with only three enemy cannon.|$|E
