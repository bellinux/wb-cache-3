Betaine is a methyl donor and has been considered to be a <b>lipotropic</b> <b>agent.</b> However, whether betaine supplementation improves NAFLD via its effect on the DNA methylation of specific genes and the genome has not been explored. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed either a control diet or high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with 0 %, 1 % and 2 % betaine in water (wt/vol) for 12 weeks. Betaine supplementation ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in a dose-dependent manner. HFD up-regulated FAS and ACOX messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and down-regulated PPAR alpha, ApoB and MTTP mRNA expression; however, these alterations were reversed by betaine supplementation, except ApoB. MTTP mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the DNA methylation of its CpG sites at - 184, - 156, - 63 and - 60. Methylation of these CpG sites was lower in both the 1 % and 2 % betaine-supplemented groups than in the HFD group (averages; 25. 55 % and 14. 33 % vs. 30. 13 %). In addition, both 1 % and 2 % betaine supplementation significantly restored the methylation capacity [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentration and SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios] and genomic methylation level, which had been decreased by HFD (0. 37 % and 0. 47 % vs. 0. 25 %). These results suggest that the regulation of aberrant DNA methylation by betaine might be a possible mechanism of the improvements in NAFLD upon betaine supplementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Carnitine is {{essential}} for fatty acids translocation, muscles function and exercise performance. Choline is a <b>lipotropic</b> <b>agent</b> that prevents deposition of fat in the liver. The studies concerning the effects of carnitine and choline supplementation with exercise on carnitine status and serum leptin are rare. The aim {{of the present study}} was to study the effect of carnitine and its combination with choline, with or without exercise on body and total fat pad (TFP) weights, serum carnitine, leptin, -hydroxy butyric acid (-HBA), triacylglycerols (TAG) and Free Fatty acids (FFA). Also, total lipids (TL) and TAG content of TFP and urinary carnitine were investigated. Material and Methods: 48 male rats were equally divided to the following groups: control (C), carnitine (5 g/Kg diet) supplemented, carnitine plus choline (5 and 11. 5 g /Kg diet respectively) supplemented. Half of each group was subjected to short term aerobic exercise on manual treadmill, in which the speed and duration were gradually increased via the course of the experiment, to be 10 m/min for 20 min/day, 5 days/week in the last 2 weeks. Body weights were recorded weekly. After 6 weeks, The 24 hours urine was collected then the fasted rats were sacrificed and blood and the total fat pad (TFP) were collected for analysis. Results: Carnitine supplementation, tended to decrease body weight, TFP, TAG content and serum FFA, and significantly decreased the TL content, serum leptin, TAG (P< 0. 0005). Carnitine feeding resulted in a significant elevation of serum carnitine, -HBA and urinary carnitine (P< 0. 0005), compared to sedentary control rats. These values became more pronounced on choline addition to the diet except for serum and urinary carnitine that reversed (i. e. decreased) by choline addition. Exercise intervention resulted in a significant decrease in body weight, TFP, TL content and serum leptin, TAG and FFA. These values were more pronounced in both supplements with exercise, specially serum carnitine. However, exercise caused reduction of urinary carnitine in non-supplemented and carnitine supplemented groups and this was reversed by choline and exercise. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the beneficial effects of carnitine supplements is promoted by choline with or without mild exercise to reduce body weight, body fat, serum leptin and promote fat loss by increasing lipolysis as indicated by increased serum -HBA. These results may or may not be applicable to humans, so further research is recommended to determine whether similar effects would result in humans or not...|$|E
40|$|Many {{substances}} {{have been}} used {{during the last three}} decades to influence the course of experimental arteriosclerosis. Amongst these choline and other <b>lipotropic</b> <b>agents</b> have occupied a prominent place. No uniform results have, however, been obtained in these researches, so that it was considered worthwhile to re-investigate the problem, employing the rabbit as experimental animal and choline, which is not only a potent lipotropic substance but also, because of its many physiological functions, a potentially important therapeutic agent.

40|$|The {{action of}} choline and {{methionine}} in pre-venting or curing the fatty infiltration {{of the liver}} which is produced experimentally in animals by low protein diets is believed to result from an in-creased turnover of phospholipides in the liver (1, 2). Since this organ is the main, if not the sole, source of phospholipides in plasma (3), {{it would seem that}} changes in the formation of phospho-lipides in the liver would be reflected by corre-sponding changes in the amounts of newly formed phospholipides in the plasma (4). No methods were available for the determination of newly formed plasma phospholipides until isotopic tech-niques were developed and radioactive tracers became available. It is now possible to study the formation of plasma phospholipides following the administra-tion of radioactive phosphorus, and to obtain an indication of the turnover of these compounds in the liver. Few data of this sort are available for human subjects, however. Hence, it became nec-essary to estimate the turnover in normal persons, before the effects of <b>lipotropic</b> <b>agents</b> such as cho-line and methionine could be investigated and in-formation could be obtained on the mode of ac-tion and possible therapeutic application of these substances. Preliminary experiments to determine the va-lidity of the method for determining the radioac-tivity and phosphorus of the plasma lipides in per-sons with and without liver disease were done and the results obtained were used to calculate the turnover of phospholipides (specific activity) (5) ...|$|R
