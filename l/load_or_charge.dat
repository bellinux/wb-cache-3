It {{is possible to}} perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate; to keep a battery fully charged. However, if the battery {{is going to be}} stored unused {{for a long period of}} time, it should be discharged down to at most 40% of capacity (some manufacturers recommend fully discharging and even short-circuiting once fully discharged), and stored in a cool, dry environment.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{internal}} combustion engines display high overall maximum global efficiencies, this potential cannot be fully exploited in automotive applications: in real conditions, the average engine load (and thus efficiency) is quite {{low and the}} kinetic energy during a braking phase is lost. One {{solution to this problem}} is to switch to a new hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine concept, which is able to store energy in the form of compressed air. This energy can be issued from a braking phase or from a combustion phase at low power. The potential energy from the air tank can then be restored to start the engine, use the stored air to drive the engine as a pneumatic motor at low <b>load</b> <b>or</b> <b>charge</b> the engine at full load. Optimization of the compressed air tank maximum pressure and volume as well as the operating mode switching strategy provides an improvement in terms of fuel economy as high as 31 per cent if combined with engine downsizing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} subsequent experimental testing of a porous ceramic wall which was employed to enhance radiative heat transfer in a gas fired, billet reheating furnace. The system was fired by a recuperative burner and the porous wall, which was constructed from zirconia panels, was located in the end wall of the furnace upstream of this burner. The passage of the flue gases results in the transfer of sensible heat energy to the porous ceramic and a substantial proportion of this recovered energy is reradiated back into the furnace chamber and hence to the <b>load</b> <b>or</b> <b>charge.</b> The size and positioning of the porous wall was carefully selected using mathematical models and small scale laboratory tests {{in order to ensure}} high levels of radiation enhancement, low resistance to flow and acceptable flow uniformity through the wall. Furnace tests demonstrated that the porous wall can provide effective heat recovery from the exhaust gases. This has resulted in significant enhancement in thermal radiation to the test billets and consequent energy savings of up to 22...|$|E

40|$|Power is {{required}} for all man-made systems to work and perform their corresponding activi-ties. Generation of power in large scale is carried out from power grids and supplied to systems that need high power whereas systems requiring less power are supplied from batteries. Batteries {{need to be replaced}} after their lifetime which seem to be a less attractive option in applications where systems are placed out of reach for humans as WSN nodes or in some of biomedical systems which are kept inside human body. The need for a self-supporting system i. e. a system that produces energy by itself and supports all the modules by powering them by itself is increased. A harvesting system that harvests energy from the ambience and converting that energy into electrical form and supplying the power to <b>loads</b> <b>or</b> storing in a battery is the solution for all the problems mentioned above. Solar, thermal, vibration and RF are the sources in the ambience from which energy can be harvested and supplied to <b>load</b> <b>or</b> <b>charged</b> into a battery. Availability of a single energy source(thermal,vibration,solar,RF) at all instances cannot be guaranteed creating a situation of insufficient supply of power to <b>loads</b> <b>or</b> unable to <b>charge</b> the load capacitor to the required voltage. Usage of multiple sources for harvesting energy is a prominent solution to the above mentioned problem. Designing a microscale energy harvesting from multiple sources is the main motto behind the current work. TEG and piezo are compatible to be used alternatively in the system because of their close resemblance in their energy densities. Therefore TEG and piezo have been used as two input sources for the system. The other modules in the system include design of a buck boost power converter that switches between buck and boost modes depending on the source connected to the system and the input voltage available at the input. The other module being a digital controller that generates clocks for power switches, signals that decide if TEG or piezo need to be connected to the system.

40|$|This paper {{endeavours}} {{to answer}} the research {{question of how to}} efficiently operate a system of multiple chillers in the most effective combination regime. In the process, a successful method of assessing this has been developed, which has proven that {{the most effective way to}} run a multi-configuration chiller scheme is by following two distinct methods. One method deals with a multi-chiller setting that has thermal storage, and the other method deals with a multi-chiller systems without storage. The latter method is discussed more in this paper. The former method is based on other research papers that argue the easiest and most efficient method of running a multi-chiller system is to have thermal storage. This allows a staging regime that can operate any number of chillers at their maximum co-efficiency of performance (COP) or efficiency performance, while either supplying the <b>load</b> <b>or</b> <b>charging</b> the thermal storage. The fact that the chillers can always operate at their maximum point makes this method the most efficient available; however, in some cases there is no thermal storage available and the analysis changes slightly. A detailed analysis of the different methods of staging has been carried out and it proved that the most efficient way of running a multi-configuration setup chiller system is to run the target load closest to the next nearest chiller configuration that can supply that load. An algorithm and system has been developed on the best way to do this, and further work on how computational resources can be exploited to do this more easily is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a high-efficiency single-input {{multiple}} output (SIMO) dc–dc converter. The proposed converter can boost the voltage of a low-voltage input power source to a controllable high-voltage dc bus and middle-voltage output terminals and low voltage output terminals. The high-voltage dc bus can take as the main power for a high-voltage dc <b>load</b> <b>or</b> the front terminal of a dc–ac inverter. Moreover, middle-voltage output terminals can supply powers for individual middle-voltage dc <b>loads</b> <b>or</b> for <b>charging</b> auxiliary power sources (e. g., battery modules). and low voltage can be used for charging battery. In this study, a coupled-inductor based dc–dc converter scheme utilizes only one power switch with the properties of voltage clamping and soft switching, and the corresponding device specifications are adequately designed. As a result, the objectives of high-efficiency power conversion, high stepup ratio, and various output voltages with different levels can be obtained. Also a series forward flyback converter is integrated to this converter for producing isolated output. Some experimental results via a kilowatt-level prototype are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SIMO dc–dc converter in practical applications [...] Keywords-High efficient,High voltage gain,; Flyback converter,series- forward flyback converter,SIMO converter I...|$|R
40|$|The multi-input dc/dc boost {{converter}} is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter uses two {{sources such as}} wind, photovoltaic(PV) and battery as a storage element for hybridizing alternative energy sources. This converter draws the power from two different sources depending upon climatic condition and deliver it to the dc <b>load</b> individually <b>or</b> simultaneously. The system is applicable for DC loads which requires 350 V and 8 A. Supplying the output <b>load,</b> <b>charging</b> <b>or</b> discharging the battery {{can be made by}} the PV and the wind power sources individually or simultaneously. The output voltage regulation and power flow control can be achieved by controlling the duty ratio of the four switches. This converter structure uses only four power switches that are independently controlled with four different duty ratios for controlling the whole operation of the converter. Depending on utilization state of the battery, three different power operation modes are defined for the converter either <b>charging</b> <b>or</b> discharging action to be taken place.
