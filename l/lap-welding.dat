40|$|Laser-arc hybrid welding {{combines}} the laser and arc welding processes to provide advantages {{not found in}} either. This process can weld lapped steel sheets that have a larger gap than is possible with laser welding. Blowholes form when <b>lap-welding</b> zinc-coated steel sheets because of the zinc that is vaporized. The laser-arc hybrid welding proc-ess can lap-weld zinc-coated steel sheets without causing blowholes. The welding speed of laser-arc hybrid welding is nearly equivalent to that of laser welding. Laser-arc hybrid welding produces high-quality lap joints and is ideal for assembly welding of automotive parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of lithium-ion and/or super-capacitor battery technologies is a current hot {{topic in the}} automotive industry. For both battery types, the terminals and busbars are manufactured from copper (Cu) and/or aluminium-based (Al-based) alloys, {{as a result of}} their high electrical and thermal conductivities. Laser welding is considered an attractive process to industry due to its easy auto-motability, high processing speed and highly repeatable cost-effective processing. However, laser welding of monometallic and dissimilar Cu and A 1 presents several difficulties due to the high surface reflectivity at infrared (IR.) wavelengths. Three main areas were investigated in this research work: • Laser beam <b>lap-welding</b> of monometallic Cu sheets, with the aim of validating the developed welding procedures against target specifications addressed by the automotive industry, in line with production environment setups. • The suitability of using tailored energy distributions, produced using a 1070 nm laser source delivered through a laser beam scanner, for welding multiple overlapping Al or Cu foils. • The effects of different laser processing parameters on the formation of deleterious brittle intermetallic phases when welding Alto Cu with a continuous-wave Yb-fibre laser. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEmbedded welding defects, such as {{porosities}} and cracks, {{are generally}} formed during aluminium laser welding. It is challenging to test these defects with current non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods. This work features {{the creation of}} defects and their study {{with the help of}} NDE methods. The chosen method should be able to detect porosities in <b>lap-welded</b> sheets of 5754 aluminium alloys. The welding process is described and the samples were first characterised with X-ray techniques to choose those containing defects of various sizes and densities. Secondly, these welds were tested with the Laser Ultrasonic Technique (LUT). The first results show that LUT gives defect signatures. Based on raw measurements only, our results show {{that it is difficult to}} give any precise description of the defects' size or position.

40|$|Moire {{interferometry}} {{combined with}} hole-drilling {{is an effective}} method for measuring welding residual deformation. In this study, two <b>lap-welded</b> rectangular steel plates with different overlap widths were manufactured, and cross-gratings with a frequency of 1200 lines per mm were replicated on test areas of the welds. Sixteen through holes were drilled in the plates to release residual stress, while Moire interferometry, integrated with a phase-shifting technique, {{was used to determine}} the corresponding surface residual deformation. The distribution characteristics of the residual displacements around the drilled holes were investigated using the experimental data as basis. The relationship between the residual displacement located in the plates and the distance to the weld lines is also presented in this paper. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the residual strain both near the holes and within the plates were analysed. The experimental data and detailed analysis in this paper can serve as some reference for research on the residual strain of welds. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate how the keyhole responds to {{a decrease in the}} ambient pressure using a coaxial observation method in the laser welding of zinc-coated steel sheets. To understand the effect of zinc coating on keyhole dynamics, both zinc-coated and uncoated DP 590 steel sheets were studied using a 2 kW multi-mode fiber laser in a zero-gap <b>lap-weld</b> configuration. Two energy density conditions (1830 W, 12. 5 mm/s and 1230 W, 21. 2 mm/s) and four ambient pressures (101. 3, 10, 1 and 0. 1 kPa) were considered systematically. For these conditions, time-averaged 3 -D keyhole shapes were reconstructed by analyzing top and bottom surface video images. This study showed that zinc evaporation was much more intensified than the evaporation of steel at subatmospheric pressures, which made the keyhole highly fluctuating and elongated in the welding direction for the zinc-coated steel. Also, the bottom aperture opening time increased as the ambient pressure was decreased due to the enhanced effect of evaporation, which led to less energy absorption and smaller melt pools. The weld quality became poorer as the spacing of weld chevrons were wider and more erratic, and more fumes with less light emission were observed at reduced ambient pressures...|$|R
40|$|Dissimilar {{welding process}} yields {{unwanted}} disadvantages on the weld joint {{due to the}} large difference between stainless steel-aluminium sheets melting points and nearly zeros solid solubility between these two metals. Aluminium AA 6061 and stainless steel SUS 304 were <b>lap-welded</b> by using Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding with aluminium filler ER 5356 and stainless steel filler ER 308 LSi. The effect of welding voltage and type of filler metals used to the weld joints were studied. The welding voltage had significance effect to the welding process, as high voltage resulted in poor appearance of the weld joint. Joints between aluminium and stainless steel using aluminium filler have good microstructure as it shows enrichment of eutectic silicon particle, thus increase the hardness of the joint.

40|$|Because of its low {{density and}} high strength, {{magnesium}} (Mg) and its alloys are being sought after in {{the automotive industry}} for structural applications. Although many road-going cars today contain cast Mg parts, in the fabrication of chassis structural members the wrought alloys are required. One of the challenges of fabrication with wrought Mg is welding and joining the formed sheets. Because of the commonly observed difficulties in fusion welding of Mg such as hot cracking and severe Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), this work aimed to establish the feasibility of the solid-state process Magnetic Pulse Welding in producing lap welds of Mg sheet. Mg AZ 31 alloy sheets have been <b>lap-welded</b> with Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW), an Impact Welding technique, using H-shaped symmetric coils connected to a Pulsar MPW- 25 capacitor bank. MPW uses the interaction between two opposing magnetic fields to create a high speed oblique collision between the metal surfaces. The oblique impact sweeps away the contaminated surface layers and forces intimate contact between clean materials to produce a solid-state weld. Various combinations of similar and dissimilar metals can be welded using MPW. Other advantages of MPW are high speed, high strength, {{and the possibility of}} being mounted on a robotic arm. The present research focuses on the feasibility and mechanical performance of an MPW weld of 0. 6 mm AZ 31 Mg alloy sheets made in a lap joint configuration. Tensile shear tests were carried out on the joints produced. Load bearing capacity showed linear increase with capacitor bank discharge energy up to a certain value above which a parabolic increase was seen. Strength was estimated to be at least as high as base metal strength by measuring the fracture surface area of selected samples. The fracture surface of samples welded at higher discharge energy showed two regions. In the beginning of the bond a platelet-featured fracture brittle in appearance and a ductile, micro-voiding fracture in the latter part. The joint cross section morphology consisted of a flattened area that had two symmetric bond zones 1 mm wide each separated by an unbonded centre zone ~ 3 mm wide. Reasons for the morphology were presented as a sequence of events based on the transient nature of the oblique collision angle. The interface microstructure was studied by optical and electron microscopy. Examination of the bonds has revealed sound and defect free interfaces. No microcracking, porosity, resolidification, or secondary phase formation was observed. Metallographic examination of the unbonded centre zone revealed anisotropic deformation and a lack of cleaning from the interface. This zone is formed as a result of normal impact in the initial stage of collision. The bond zone interface of the joint was characterized by a smooth interface consisting of refined grains. In samples welded at higher energy interfacial waves developed {{in the latter half of}} the bond zone. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the bond zone revealed a continuous interface having an 8 - 25 μm thick interlayer that coincided with the waves and had a dislocation cell structure and distinct boundaries with adjacent material. Equiaxed 300 nm dynamic recrystallized (DRX) grains were found adjacent to the interlayer as well as other slightly larger elongated grains. The interlayer is thought to be formed in plasticized state at elevated temperature through severe shear strain heating. The interlayer corresponds to a ductile fracture surface and, along with the interfacial waves, is responsible for the joint’s high strength...|$|R
40|$|The use of cold-formed steel {{structures}} is increasing rapidly {{around the world}} due to the many advances in construction and manufacturing technologies and relevant standards. However, the structural behaviour of these thin-walled {{steel structures}} is characterised by a range of buckling modes such as local buckling, distortional buckling or flexural torsional buckling. These buckling problems generally lead to severe reduction and complicated calculations of their member strengths. Therefore {{it is important to}} eliminate or delay these buckling problems and simplify the strength calculations of cold-formed steel members. The Hollow Flange Beam with two triangular hollow flanges, developed by Palmer Tube Mills Pty Ltd in the mid- 1990 s, has an innovative section that can delay the above buckling problems efficiently. This structural member is considered to combine the advantages of hot-rolled I-sections and conventional cold-formed sections such as C- and Z-sections (Dempsey, 1990). However, this structural product was discontinued in 1997 due to the complicated manufacturing process and the expensive electric resistance welding method associated with severe residual stresses (Doan and Mahendran, 1996). In this thesis, new fastening methods using spot-weld, screw fastener and self-pierced rivet were considered for the triangular Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs) and the new rectangular hollow flange beams (RHFBs). The structural behaviour of these types of members in axial compression was focused in this research project. The objective of this research was to develop suitable design models for the members with triangular and rectangular hollow flanges using new fastening methods so that their behaviour and ultimate strength can be predicted accurately under axial compression. In the first stage of this research a large number of finite element analyses (FEA) was conducted to study the behaviour of the electric resistance welded, triangular HFBs (ERW-HFBs) under axial compression. Experimental results from previous researchers were used to verify the finite element model and its results. Appropriate design rules based on the current design codes were recommended. Further, a series of finite element models was developed to simulate the corresponding HFBs fastened using <b>lap-welds</b> (called LW-HFBs) and screw fasteners or spot-welds or self-piercing rivets (called S-HFBs). Since the test specimens of LW-HFBs and S-HFBs were unavailable, the finite element results were verified by comparison with the experimental results of ERW-HFB with reasonable agreement. In the second stage of this research, a total of 51 members with rectangular hollow flanges including the RHFBs made from a single plate and 3 PRHFBs made from three plates fastened with spot-welds and screws was tested under axial compression. The finite element models based on the tests were then developed that included the new fasteners, contact simulations, geometric imperfections and residual stresses. The improved finite element models were able to simulate local buckling, yielding, global buckling and local/global buckling interaction failure associated with gap opening as agreed well with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. Extensive parametric studies for the RHFBs made from a single plate and the 3 PRHFBs made from three plates were undertaken using finite element analyses. The analytical results were compared with the predictions using the current design rules based on AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and the new direct strength method. Appropriate design formulae based on the direct strength method for RHFBs and 3 PRHFBs were developed. This thesis has thus enabled the accurate prediction of the behaviour and strength of the new compression members with hollow flanges and paved the way for economical and efficient use of these members in the industry...|$|R
