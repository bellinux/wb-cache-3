The geometric modelling method for involute worm gears allows the tooth elastic deformation and tooth root stresses of worm gear drives under different load conditions to be investigated. On the basis of finite element analysis, the instantaneous meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors are obtained and the <b>load</b> <b>share</b> is predicted.

First, planet-bearing load and motion data is analyzed to characterize planetary stage behavior in different environments and to derive requirements for gearbox models and life calculations. Second, a set of models are constructed that represent different levels of fidelity. Simulations of the test conditions are compared to the test data and the computational cost of the models are compared. The test data suggests that the planet-bearing life calculations should be made separately for each bearing on a row due to unequal load distribution. It also shows that tilting of the gear axes is related to planet <b>load</b> <b>share.</b> The modeling study concluded that fully flexible models were needed to predict planet-bearing loading in some cases, although less complex models were able to achieve good correlation in the field-loading case.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{appropriate}} implant continues to be critical for fixation of unstable hip fractures. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to develop a numerical model to investigate the mechanical performance of hip fracture osteosynthesis. We hypothesized that decreasing fracture stability results in increasing <b>load</b> <b>share</b> of the implant and therefore higher stress within the implant. We also investigated the relationship of interfragmentary movement to the fracture stability. A finite element model was developed for a cephalomedullary nail within a synthetic femur and simulated a pertrochanteric fracture, a lateral neck fracture, and a subtrochanteric fracture. The femur was loaded with a hip force and was constrained physiologically. The FE model was validated by mechanical experiments. All three fractures resulted in similar values for stiffness (462 – 528  N/mm). The subtrochanteric fracture resulted in the highest local stress (665  MPa), and the pertrochanteric fracture resulted in a lower stress (621  MPa) with even lower values for the lateral neck fracture (480  MPa). Thus, intramedullary implants can stabilize unstable hip fractures with almost the same amount of stiffness as seen in stable fractures, but they have to bear a higher <b>load</b> <b>share,</b> resulting in higher stresses in the implant...|$|R
