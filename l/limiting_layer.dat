All other factors being equal, the influence of two parameters is looked after: the cylinder height, equivalent to the volume/surface ratio of the samples, and {{the direction of the}} air flow. The tests are interpreted both from the drying curves and from the values of water and heat transfer coefficients. Results first highlight that air flow incidence on the dried surface changes the kinetics and the transfer coefficient values. It can thus be supposed that the air flow direction would modify the thickness of the transfer <b>limit</b> <b>layer</b> at the surface and/or would make invalid the hypothesis of such a <b>limit</b> <b>layer</b> model for some flow configurations. Besides, the volume/surface ratio is shown to be correlated to the evaporation flux on the constant drying phase, and thus to the transfer coefficients. Nonetheless, this link tends to disappear from sufficiently high values of the volume/surface ratio since, in this case, the transfer coefficients reach constant values. This effect, in addition to other observations made on the drying curves, well fits with the hypothesis of a hydraulically connected layer below the drying surface, which would maintain during the constant drying rate phase.

40|$|The current-voltage {{characteristic}} and {{the performance}} of organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells are very sensitive to small variations in the production steps or environmental influences. In our experiments, we found a large variation of the short-circuit current, which does not correspond to the device thickness as one might expect. The fill factor of some devices is below 25 % under illumination, while the best devices have a fill factor of about 70 %. Electrical impedance spectroscopy can provide information about the conductivity of different regions within the device. In earlier measurements, it was observed that devices with a thick absorber layer might consist of a conductive bulk region and a very poorly conductive depletion region at the metal contact. Using a standard semiconductor device model, it is shown in this paper that this reduces the charge collection efficiency under short-circuit conditions, as there is no electrical field in the bulk region, supporting the charge separation. For devices with the low fill factor, a thin-current <b>limiting</b> <b>layer</b> under forward bias can be identified by electrical impedance spectroscopy and is suggestive of a corroded metal contact. © 2006 Elsevier B.

A simple improvement of this expression consists in the oxygen concentration depletion along the gas channel.

The 0. 1 deg C gradient is applied for the thermocline layer determination during four seasons data in 2014. The dataset of INDESO Project (daily, 1 / 12 deg) has been used.

Simultaneously, it was also concluded that a relatively high surface coverage could be obtained with very low PAA concentrations (0. 5 – 2 ppm), indicating the good adsorption characteristics of PAA on mild steel and iron in hydrochloride acid.

Hydrologic {{heterogeneities}} (e. g., macropores {{and gravel}} outcrops) in floodplains are hypothesized {{to play an}} integral role in impacting flow and leaching between the soil surface and shallow alluvial aquifers, which are intricately connected to streams. Infiltration is often assumed to be uniform, but this neglects the spatial variability common in aniso-tropic, heterogeneous alluvial floodplain soils. The objective {{of this research was}} to quantify infiltration and hydraulic conductivity across a range of scales (point to 100 m 2) using a berm infiltration technique. Plot-scale leaching experi-ments were performed across a range of soil types at each of three floodplain sites in northeastern Oklahoma and north-western Arkansas. Plots maintained a constant head of 2 to 9 cm for up to 52 h. Effective saturated hydraulic conductivity (Keff), based on plot-scale infiltration rates and a one-dimensional Darcy flow equation, ranged between 0. 6 and 68 cm h- 1 and varied considerably even within a single floodplain. The Keff was also calculated at the point scale using particle size distributions and Retention Curve (RETC). Point-scale estimates were significantly lower than plot-scale Keff and also failed to capture the variability of Keff. The estimated permeability of the <b>limiting</b> <b>layer</b> reported in soil surveys was con-sistent with point-scale estimates of Keff but was lower than plot-scale Keff at most sites.

The objectives of this paper were to discuss the characteristics ofSpodosols in Kalimantan and Sumatra and the possibility of their utilization. In Indonesia, this soil is found in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Papua Islands. Parent materials of the soils were originated from quartz sand, sediment or acid sedimentary rocks (quartz sandstone) with low nutrients status. Physiographically, the soils were distributed in alluvial plain, colluvial, sand beach, sand dune, tectonic plain and sandstone plateau on elevation of 5 to > 1, 500 m asl, with flat to nearly undulating relieves.

Analysis of radar or seismic reflection data can combine velocity analysis with common physical transformations to provide subsurface physical properties such as subsurface porosity, density, and contaminant locations. However, reliable quantitative characterization of thin subsurface layers {{may be impossible}} using standard reflection data processing techniques, e. g. velocity analysis, if the layer thickness is below the conventional resolution limits of the data. The <b>limiting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness for layer resolution may be up to ½ or even ¾ of the dominant wavelength (λ) of the signal in the medium of interest. This limitation often depends on data noise levels and source characteristics. In many environmental problems, target layers may be below this layer thickness and accurate determination of layer properties becomes problematic. In order to reliably quantify thin-layer parameters in these cases, geophysical practitioners require additional tools such as attribute analyses and inversion methodologies. Full-waveform inversions {{may be able to}} quantify layer parameters even in the case of thin (3 ̆c ½λ) and ultra-thin (3 ̆c ⅛λ) layers by inverting directly for thin-layer properties.

I demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on model and field data collected using radar and seismic reflection methods. These methods depend on surface records of reflection information from subsurface interfaces and may fail if reflections are obscured or attenuated in the subsurface. Therefore, I demonstrate that a new dual-polarization system can mitigate the effects of the overburden anisotropy and conductivity attenuation on radar data collected in Arctic conditions.

The significance of this problem has been highlighted by litigation, with one case even reaching the U. S. Supreme Court (Arkansas et al. v. Oklahoma et al., 503 U. S. 91) which required the upstream state to meet downstream water quality standards. The overarching objective of this line of research was to characterize phosphorus leaching to alluvial aquifers in the coarse gravel floodplains of the Ozark ecoregion, while the specific objective of this paper was to quantify infiltration and hydraulic conductivity across a range of scales (point to 100 m 2) to evaluate the effect of the scale of measurement. It is hypothesized that hydrologic heterogeneities (e. g., macropores and gravel outcrops) in the subsurface play an integral role in impacting flow and contaminant transport between the soil surface and alluvial aquifers. Innovative field studies, including plot scale injection experiments, were performed across a range of soil types at each of three floodplain sites in the Ozark ecoregion. Solutes in the injection water included phosphorus, P (highly sorptive), Rhodamine WT (slightly sorptive), and chloride (conservative). Plots maintained a constant head of 2 to 9 cm for up to 52 hours. Effective saturated hydraulic conductivity (Keff) data, based on plot scale infiltration rates, were high (0. 6 to 68 cm hr- 1) and varied greatly, even within a single floodplain. The Keff was also measured with a double ring infiltrometer and estimated at the point scale using Retention Curve (RETC) along with particle size distribution data.
