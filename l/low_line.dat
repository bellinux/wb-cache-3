5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching <b>low</b> <b>line</b> drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a <b>low</b> <b>line</b> drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have been wrong by video replays.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Carcass {{composition}} of two populations of females selected for divergence in yolk cholesterol level were obtained {{to determine if}} changes between lines in body weights were due to alteration of lipid metabolism. The 75 -week body weights of the line selected from a broiler-type population for low yolk cholesterol were 76 % that of the high yolk cholesterol line. The body weights of the <b>low</b> cholesterol <b>line</b> selected from a Leghorn-type population were 90 % that of the high line. Carcass compositions were not different between high and <b>low</b> <b>lines</b> within populations. Thus, differences in body weight between the high and <b>low</b> cholesterol <b>lines</b> were proportional for the various carcass components, indicating that the lipid metabolism was not altered by selection for yolk cholesterol...|$|R

An old-style font normally has a left-inclining curve axis with weight stress at about 8 and 2 o'clock; serifs are almost always bracketed (they have curves connecting the serif to the stroke); head serifs are often angled.|$|E

2500|$|Versteeg et al. (2003) tried, with {{a better}} human genome map and better SAGE taqs, to {{determine}} the characteristics of RIDGEs more specific. Overlapping genes were treated as one gene, and genes without introns were rejected as pseudogenes. They determined that RIDGEs are very gene dense, have a high gene expression, short introns, high SINE repeat density and <b>low</b> <b>LINE</b> repeat density. Clusters containing genes with very low transcription levels had characteristics that were the opposite of RIDGEs, therefore those clusters were called antiridges. LINE repeats are junk DNA which contains a cleavage site of endonuclease (TTTTA). Their scarcity in RIDGEs {{can be explained by}} the fact that natural selection favors the scarcity of LINE repeats in ORFs because their endonuclease sites can cause deleterious mutation to the genes. Why SINE repeats are abundant is not yet understood.|$|E
2500|$|The greater {{majority}} of MTs presently {{work from home}} offices rather than in hospitals, working off-site for [...] "national" [...] transcription services. It is predominantly those nationals located in the United States who are striving to outsource work to other-than-US-based transcriptionists. In outsourcing work to sometimes lesser-qualified and lower-paid non-US MTs, the nationals unfortunately can force US transcriptionists to accept lower rates, {{at the risk of}} losing business altogether to the cheaper outsourcing providers. [...] In addition to the <b>low</b> <b>line</b> rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs (independent contractors); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc. Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate {{as they did in the}} past for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.|$|E

2500|$|The line {{is single}} {{throughout}} with a passing loop at Halfway Station (known previously as Paston Place and Peter Pan's Playground). There are also two passing loops roughly midway between each terminal and Halfway, although neither {{is used in}} normal service. In normal service two trains operate from end to end, passing at Halfway station and there is generally only one train on each single track section at any one time. This is sufficient to provide a 15-minute interval service. Drivers are now equipped with radios which allow communication between themselves, stations and control. [...] Nevertheless, the line is operated using single track tokens. [...] There are two tokens, one for the section between Aquarium and Halfway, and one for Halfway to Black Rock. [...] Due to the <b>low</b> <b>line</b> speed, multiple trains are able to operate in each section, but the token must be carried on the train furthest from Halfway.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ability {{to utilize}} dietary phytate P was {{evaluated}} in 1, 387 broiler chicks of 45 sire and 180 dam families, by feeding a corn-soybean base diet sup-plemented with no inorganic P {{and a low}} level of Ca. These chicks were the progeny of high and low incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) selected diver-gently for 11 generations and a nonselected control line. Chicks from the control line utilized phytate P better than those from the high or <b>low</b> <b>lines</b> in terms of livability, mortality, and growth performance. Chicks did not differ in mortality and body weight between the high and <b>low</b> <b>lines.</b> Variation in livability and mortality was greater among lines than among families, whereas families accounted for a greater part of variation than lines in body weight. Dams accounted for a slightly larger proportion of variation than sires in traits studied. Genetic selection for improved utilization of dietary phytate P could be effective...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrates {{respond to}} {{environmental}} stressors through the neuro-endocrine stress response, which involves {{the production of}} glucocorticoids. We have selected independent, duplicate divergent lines of zebra finches for high, low and control corticosterone responses to a mild stressor. This experiment has shown that over the first four generations, the high lines have demonstrated a significant realized heritability of about 20 %. However, the <b>low</b> <b>lines</b> have apparently not changed significantly from controls. This asymmetry in response is potentially {{because of the fact}} that all birds appear to be showing increased adaptation to the environment in which they are housed, with significant declines in corticosterone response in control lines as well as <b>low</b> <b>lines.</b> Despite the existence of two- to threefold difference in mean corticosterone titre between high and <b>low</b> <b>lines,</b> there were no observed differences in testosterone titre in adult male birds from the different groups. In addition, there were no consistent, significant differences between the lines in any of the life history variables measured - number of eggs laid per clutch, number of clutches or broods produced per pair, number of fledglings produced per breeding attempt, nor in any of egg, nestling and fledgling mortality. These results highlight the fact that the mechanisms that underlie variation in the avian physiological system can be modified to respond to differences between environments through selection. This adds an additional level of flexibility to the avian physiological system, which will allow it to respond to environmental circumstances. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.
