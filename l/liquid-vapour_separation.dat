40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to detect the presence of small amounts of chemical substances in water, using a Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle thin film covered with phosphonic acid (HDF-PA) self-assembled monolayer. The HDF-PA self-assembled Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle thin film acts as a <b>liquid-vapour</b> <b>separation</b> filter, allowing the passage of chemical vapour while blocking liquids. Prevention of the liquid from contacting the SnO 2 nanowire and source-drain electrodes is {{required in order to}} avoid abnormal operation. Using this characteristic, the concentration of chemical substances in water could be evaluated by measuring the current changes in the SnO 2 nanowire transistor covered with the HDF-PA self-assembled Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle thin film...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a two-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann model for liquid-vapour systems with variable temperature. Our model {{is based on}} a single particle distribution function expanded with respect to the full-range Hermite polynomials. In order to ensure the recovery of the hydrodynamic equations for thermal flows, we used a fourth order expansion together with a set of momentum vectors with 25 elements whose Cartesian projections are the roots of the Hermite polynomial of order Q= 5. Since these vectors are off-lattice, a projection scheme involving flux limiters is used to evolve the corresponding set of distribution functions. A third order scheme employing a 25 point stencil is used to compute the gradient operators in the force term that ensures the <b>liquid-vapour</b> phase <b>separation</b> and diffuse reflection boundary conditions are used on the walls. We investigated the <b>liquid-vapour</b> phase <b>separation</b> between two parallel walls kept at a constant temperature T_w smaller than the critical temperature T_c. The effect of the spurious velocity on the temperature profile was found to be smaller that 1. 0 %, even when T_w < 0. 7 T_c...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} fluids {{where the}} attractive interaction at distances {{slightly larger than}} the particle size is dominated at larger distances by a repulsive contribution. A previous investigation {{of the effects of}} the competition between attraction and repulsion on the liquid-vapour transition and on the correlations is extended to the study of the stability of <b>liquid-vapour</b> phase <b>separation</b> with respect to freezing. We find that this long-range repulsive part of the interaction expands the region where the fluid-solid transition preempts the liquid-vapour one, so that the critical point becomes metastable at longer attraction ranges than those required for purely attractive potentials. Moreover, the large density fluctuations that occur near the liquid-vapour critical point are greatly enhanced by the competition between attractive and repulsive forces, and encompass a much wider region than in the attractive case. The decay of correlations for states where the compressibility is large is governed by two characteristic lengths, and the usual Ornstein-Zernike picture breaks down except for the very neighborhood of the critical point, where one length reduces to the commonly adopted correlation length, while the other one saturates at a finite value.

40|$|International audienceWe use the hypernetted chain theory - complemented {{in a few}} {{selected}} {{cases by}} Monte Carlo simulations to assess its accuracy - to study a model fluid composed by hard spheres surrounded by an attractive square-well, followed by a linearly decreasing repulsive ramp. The proposed competing interaction allows us to study individually the influence of all the defining parameters on the formation of aggregates out of the homogeneous fluid, as signalled {{by the development of}} a local peak at low wavevectors in the static structure factor. We document an accurate linear scaling of the temperature whereupon aggregates develop (at constant density) as a function of both the square-well width and the height of the repulsive barrier, over a wide range of such properties; a much drastic dependence is instead observed on the repulsion range, well described by an exponential increase. We show that typical correlation distances among aggregates, in early conditions for their development, fall approximately at a constant fraction of the width of the repulsive barrier. We analyse different possibilities in which attraction or repulsion prevails in the overall balance of microscopic interaction: we document, as expected, that for sufficiently weak repulsion barriers, or sufficiently large attractive wells, the structure factor shows a trend to increase in the limit of vanishing wavevectors, heralding a standard <b>liquid-vapour</b> phase <b>separation</b> at low temperatures. At the opposite end, the development of aggregates seems to be hardly favoured, for the present model, if attraction is completely neglected...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGas {{treatment}} by liquid absorption {{is a well-known}} process to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial waste gases. Usually the liquid is an organic solvent of high boiling point; however, after VOCs' absorption it must be regenerated for the possible reuse and this step is classically achieved by heating the liquid. The paper presents the work directed to investigate an alternative regeneration step based on a <b>liquid–vapour</b> membrane <b>separation,</b> i. e. pervaporation. Because most of the energy required in pervaporation processes is consumed to remove the minor component from the initial mixture by selective permeation through the membrane, one can expect a significant energy cut in the operational costs linked to the regeneration of the liquid if the pervaporation step can substitute the heating one. The results reported here show that the technological possibility to use pervaporation is first governed by {{the stability of the}} membrane in the absorption liquid. The viability of the overall process is actually controlled by the mutual affinity between the VOCs, the solvent phase and the polymeric material. As a matter of fact, whereas VOCs have to exhibit strong affinities to both the solvent and the membrane material, the polymer has to be well resistant and even repellent to the solvent to avoid the possible sorption in the membrane that would drastically depress the pervaporation efficiency. In other words the membrane transport properties must be specific for the VOCs. This goal was reached following several experimental approaches, going from membrane modifications to the selection of suitable heavy protic solvents. Hence it has been shown for the case of dichloromethane (DCM) that low molecular weights polyalcohols (e. g. glycols) appeared to be suitable media to allow in particular the specific transport of DCM. On the other hand, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based membranes were selected for their stability in these polyglycols and for their marked affinity for DCM. The simulation of the hybrid gas treatment process at pilot-scale was also achieved by a simple model relying on experimental data for both vapour liquid equilibria and permeation flux. A simple comparison of the energy needed to regenerate the heavy solvent by each possible step has also been made...|$|R
40|$|Quartz and {{tourmaline}} {{from the}} Val-d'Or, Québec (Canada) orogenic gold vein field have oxygen isotope fractionation indicating equilibrium over {{a range of}} temperature (280 – 492 °C). The range of δ 18 O values is from 9. 2 to 13. 8 ‰, and from 6. 5 to 9. 5 ‰, for quartz and tourmaline, respectively. The hydrogen isotope composition of tourmaline has a range from − 63 to − 13 ‰. The initial Sr isotope composition (87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i)) of vein tourmaline {{at the time of}} mineralization ranged from 0. 700710 to 0. 702246. Vein carbonates have a similar range in Sr isotope composition, form 0. 701243 to 0. 703641. A series of samples from the Sigma deposit displays no systematic variation with depth for δ 18 O values of quartz or tourmaline, δD values of tourmaline, temperature of equilibrium, or 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) of local komatiite, basalt, andesite, grauwacke and granodiorite, at 2. 7 Ga, ranged from 0. 681971 to 0. 7128706. Country rocks with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) are likely a consequence of hydrothermal resetting of the Rb/Sr system in these samples. Covariation of the calculated equilibrium δDH 2 O and δ 18 OH 2 O with quartz-tourmaline equilibrium temperatures indicates mixing between a low-δ 18 O ($_amp_$lt; 1. 5 ‰), high δD ($_amp_$gt;− 10 ‰), low temperature ($_amp_$lt; 280 °C) upper crustal fluid, and a high-δ 18 O ($_amp_$gt; 9. 3 ‰), low δD ($_amp_$lt;− 40 ‰), high temperature ($_amp_$gt; 490 °C) deep-seated metamorphic fluid. At temperatures below the critical point for low-salinity hydrothermal fluids, δDH 2 O are affected by <b>liquid-vapour</b> phase <b>separation,</b> yielding the high δD values characteristic of the upper crustal fluid. A broad covariation between δ 18 OH 2 O and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) of tourmaline is consistent with mixing of two fluids from two reservoirs with different Sr concentrations and δ 18 OH 2 O values. The low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) ($_amp_$lt; 0. 7007) inferred for the deep-seated metamorphic fluid end-member is consistent with Archean prograde metamorphic dewatering of typical volcanic and sedimentary country rocks of the Val-d'Or area. The higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) ($_amp_$gt; 0. 7022) of the upper crustal fluid end-member most likely resulted from a long history of water-rock exchange between Archean seawater and carbonate and radiogenic plutonic rocks of the Abitibi sub-province...|$|R
40|$|The {{bench scale}} Novozym 435 ? catalysed {{esterification}} of 4 -methyloctanoic acid with ethanol was studied at 35 °C. Esterification in a batch reactor (molar ratio of 1 : 8 (acid:EtOH)) {{resulted in the}} isolation of the enantiomerically enriched product (eep= 81 percent and substrate (ees= 93 percent) In order to integrate reaction and <b>separation,</b> <b>liquid-vapour</b> equilibria calculations were performed showing that an excess of ethanol results in a very low ester fraction in the vapour phase. Since this is undesirable for an integrated process of reaction and product removal, a repeated batch reaction was performed using a molar ratio of 10 : 1 (acid:EtOH). After six cycles (45 percent conversion) the ee of 4 -methyloctanoic acid ethyl ester turned out to be 80 percent. For different E values the eep was calculated for batch and repeated batch reactions. It was shown that in all cases the eep was higher for the repeated batch reaction. However, the product is not enantiopure since the E value of the reaction is rather low at the low ethanol concentration used. An alternative approach would be the continuous separation of the product during the reaction. A mathematical model was developed to describe esterification in a packed bed reactor integrated with product separation. This model shows that integration of reaction and product removal in advance is not suitable either to obtain an enantiomerically pure product. Since the optimal reaction conditions (high ethanol concentration) and the optimal separation system (low ethanol concentration) do not match in this reaction, the preference is given to the batch reaction at high ethanol concentrations because in that case the highest enantioselectivity of the enzyme is obtained...|$|R
