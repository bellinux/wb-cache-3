40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for vision based road following. The approach is tailored to a well structured highway environment with <b>lane</b> <b>markers.</b> <b>Lane</b> <b>markers</b> are detected and used for dynamic update of: (i) the lateral position and orientation of the vehicle {{with respect to the}} <b>lane</b> <b>markers,</b> (ii) the estimated road curvature, and (iii) the camera parameters (height and inclination angle) in the presence of car vibration and changes in road slope. For that purpose we model the road and hence the shape of the <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> as quadric curves. The identification of these curves is done in a 3 D reference coordinate system attached to the vehicle, rather than a 3 D coordinate system attached to the road. This approach allows an unified description/estimation of the road and the vehicle parameters. ...|$|R

However, when the front vehicle appears in the near sight, {{it is not necessary}} to detect <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> to the far sight.

50|$|Camaro Challenge: Reverse Flick: The {{drivers are}} each given five {{attempts}} {{to reverse the}} Camaro into a turning area surrounded by wooden boxes and foam blocks, at which point they {{will be required to}} quickly spin the car 180 degrees while remaining within the area. Kevin takes the challenge first, and on his first four attempts he doesn't even make it into the turning area, crashing through the entry lane markers on every turn. On his fifth attempt he nearly goes through the lane markers again, but is able to stop and correct himself; subsequently he successfully executes the manoeuvre and passes the challenge. It's a similar story in Michael's first four attempts, as he repeatedly drives through the lane markers and fails to get into the turning area. On his fifth and final attempt he nearly gets the technique right, but accidentally hits the accelerator instead of the brake and reverses far off-course into the adjoining field. Despite Shelby having to be reminded by Andrew to adjust his seat (following on from the much taller Michael), he carries out the reverse flick flawlessly on his first attempt and passes with ease. On her first run, Dale drives extremely slowly and backs into a <b>lane</b> <b>marker.</b> The stress of this causes her to completely forget the lesson she was taught (in turn causing the experts to again worry that her memory seems abnormally poor), and so Andrew decides to accompany her on her second run. Despite being advised by both Andrew and Danny, she again reverses into the <b>lane</b> <b>marker,</b> and then gives up. In his first two attempts, Sly veers to one side and drives far too fast, crashing through the outer wall of the turning area on both occasions. On his third attempt however he manages to successfully spin the car around and pass, though he admits to not really knowing how he did it.|$|E
50|$|Challenger Challenge: Swerve and Avoid - The {{challenge}} is themed around avoid avoiding moose on the road. This {{is a particular}} issue for Shirley, who has killed family pets due to not swerving to avoid them. In this year's version, contestants must clear the course at 70 km/h in the Challenger. Tab accelerates to 80 km/h, and in trying to slow down {{she does not have}} enough time to get back down - and hits the barriers, destroying the front bumper. In her second attempt, she swerves too wide... and destroys the back bumper. Tab does, however, clear the course in her third attempt. Aaron passes the challenge on his first try. Shirley swerves too early in her first two runs, and hits the last <b>lane</b> <b>marker.</b> She clears the course in the third attempt. Afiya fails the course, as she goes over-speed and hits the moose in her first run. She swerves too early in the second attempt, and too late in the third. Sly accelerates to 100 km/h, and goes straight ahead and brakes, destroying the centre of the course. The {{challenge is}} aborted then - as Andrew remarks that he could not have done the challenge any worse.|$|E
50|$|Camaro Challenge: The Shoulder Check Challenge: In {{one of the}} show's most {{frequent}} challenges, the drivers each have to approach a split lane at 70 km/h, and then check left and right over their shoulder to see which lane (designated by a green marker) they must turn into. Each driver has two runs. Angelina is first-up, and on her first run drives at 100 km/h and closes her eyes, crashing straight through the central barrier, splitting the Camaro's front bumper in half and damaging its radiator. After the Camaro is repaired, Angelina takes another attempt, and nearly gets it right, but understeers and clips the barrier. Kevin understeers on his first turn, also clipping the barrier, and on his second run he steers too early and hits the lane markers; as he and Andrew note however, even this result is an improvement on the previous year. Shelby gets the challenge exactly right on the first go, as does Shirley. On his first run, Sly can't even {{make it to the}} end of the straight before driving through the lane markers, due to him turning his whole body rather than just his head. He then hits the <b>lane</b> <b>marker</b> again on his second run, this time by steering too soon. On his first run, Michael drives too slowly (at just 60 km/h) and slows down further toward the end of the straight. Andrew asks Yolanda for her honest opinion, and she launches into a tirade against Michael, which Andrew and the experts feel is an overreaction, and theorize is caused by pent-in anger at the driving-related injuries she's suffered in the past. On his second go, Michael passes with ease. Dale seems to get the technique right on her first go, but inexplicably turns into the lane she's told not to turn into. On her second go, she only checks over one shoulder and clips the central barrier, causing her to fail.|$|E
40|$|Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are a {{key area}} of {{research}} in mobile robotics. Autonomous lane detection and navigation {{is one of the}} main components of AGVs such as driverless cars.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that people rely mainly on splay angle (the optical angle of the <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> with respect to the {{vertical}} in the image plane) for lane keeping during driving (e. g., Beall & Loomis, Perception, 1996). Here we investigate whether optic flow and bearing also contribute to the control of lane keeping. The display (110 ° H × 94 ° V) simulated an observer steering a vehicle down a straight path at 3 m/s under three conditions: (a) an empty ground with <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> providing bearing and splay angle information; (b) a random-dot ground with <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> providing bearing, splay angle, and sparse optic flow information, and (c) a textured ground with <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> providing bearing, splay angle, and dense optic flow information. Participants used a joystick to control the vehicle's lateral velocity to stay {{at the center of the}} lane while the vehicle's lateral position was perturbed by the sum of seven non-harmonic sinusoids (0. 1 to 2. 19 Hz). For 11 participants (9 na?ve), the vehicle's lateral deviation from the center of the lane, indicated by the RMS error, was larger for the empty ground (mean±SE: 0. 39 ± 0. 02 m) than for the random-dot and the textured ground display (0. 37 ± 0. 02 m in both cases), indicating the influence of optic flow on lane keeping. We then varied the optical gain of bearing in the display by providing <b>lane</b> <b>markers</b> (3. 1 ± V) at three distances (3. 2 m, 7. 8 m, & 22. 2 m). For eight participants (7 naïve), the RMS error increased with the distance for the empty ground but not for the random-dot or the textured ground display, indicating that bearing information helps lane keeping in the absence of optic flow information. We conclude that optic flow, bearing, and splay angle all contribute to accurate lane keeping. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

To improve the mobility of these people, an assistive navigation system is necessary. This paper is a step towards developing this system. We propose a robust method to detect the pedestrian marked lane at traffic junctions. The proposed method involves three stages: patches of interest (POI) extraction, <b>lane</b> <b>marker</b> detection and lane detection. The POI extraction is first performed to detect image patches located on the <b>lane</b> <b>marker</b> boundaries using template matching. Potential lane markers are then formed by using shape and intensity information. Finally, the walkable lane region is determined by verifying pairs of detected potential makers. A probabilistic framework using multiple geometric cues is proposed for the verification step.

The experimental results under challenging conditions have illustrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method compared to conventional techniques. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} Multi-Camera Lane Departure Warning (MCLDW) system and a framework to evaluate it. A Lane Departure Warning (LDW) system is a safety feature that is included in a few luxury automobiles. Using a single camera, it performs the task of informing the driver if a lane change is imminent. The core component of an LDW system is a lane detector, whose objective is to find lane markers on the road. Therefore, we start this dissertation by explaining the requirements of an ideal lane detector, and then present several algorithmic implementations that meet these requirements. After selecting the best implementation, we present the MCLDW methodology. Using a multi-camera setup, MCLDW system combines the detected <b>lane</b> <b>marker</b> information from each camera's view to estimate the immediate distance between the vehicle and the <b>lane</b> <b>marker,</b> and signals a warning if this distance is under a certain threshold. Next, we introduce a procedure to create ground truth and a database of videos which serve as the framework for evaluation. Ground truth is created using an efficient procedure called Time-Slicing that allows the user to quickly annotate the true locations of the lane markers in each frame of the videos. Subsequently, we describe the details of a database of driving videos that has been put together to help establish a benchmark for evaluating existing lane detectors and LDW systems. Finally, we conclude the dissertation by citing the contributions of the research and discussing the avenues for future work.
