5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} {{must have some}} level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> at issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government {{to engage in the}} type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Matabeleland {{region in}} Zimbabwe that, during the Second Matabele War, Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, and Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship. In mid-June 1896, during a {{scouting}} patrol in the Matobo Hills, Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell woodcraft. Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed {{the concept of a}} broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> worn by Burnham.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> about the executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> at Medinet Madi, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E

5|$|This brought Justinian {{to search}} for an accord with Thurisind to stop the trans-Danubian raids, and the latter was {{more than happy to}} accept. Thurisind's envoys asked for an {{alliance}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> bonding Byzantines and Lombards. In addition to strengthening the alliance, they demanded, and got, 12senators to swear to uphold the treaty. After this, in 551, 400Gepids were sent to fight in Narses' army, which was sent to Italy—a modest army compared to the 5,500Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. He noticed that the man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the suspect was Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1911 exhibition, at the {{personal}} request of Sir George White, Coandă {{moved to the}} United Kingdom {{to take a position}} as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years.

During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> made for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.|$|E
