50|$|Inert IUDs are IUDs with no {{bioactive}} components; {{they are}} made of inert materials like stainless steel (such as the stainless steel ring, or SSR, a flexible ring of steel coils that can deform to be pushed through the cervix) or plastic (such as the <b>Lippes</b> <b>Loop,</b> which can be inserted through the cervix in a cannula and takes a trapezoidal shape within the uterus). They are less effective than copper or hormonal IUDs, with a side effect profile similar to copper IUDs. Their primary mechanism of action is inducing a local foreign body reaction, which makes the uterine environment hostile both to sperm and to implantation of an embryo. They may have higher rates of preventing pregnancy after fertilization, instead of before fertilization, compared to copper or hormonal IUDs.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis was undertaken of reports of possible pelvic infection {{in relation to}} the use of four commonly fitted intrauterine contraceptive devices during 1971 to 1978 in the United Kingdom. The four devices were the Dalkon shield, <b>Lippes</b> <b>loops</b> 3 C and 2 D, and the Gravigard (copper 7), and data used were those collected systematically through the UK intrauterine device research network. Prospective reports that the Dalkon shield was uniquely related to high levels of infection when compared with other intrauterine devices were not substantiated in this prospective study among 13 349 users. Though some factors such as social class and previous experience of abortion appeared to influence the rate of infection, the type of intrauterine device being worn {{did not appear to be}} a significant factor. Various methods of analysis were used including life table, regression, and discriminant analysis, using information relating to the type of intrauterine device worn, the characteristics of the user, the fitting centre, and the pattern of diagnosis and treatment of reported or suspected pelvic infection. The results of this study suggest that fears that the Dalkon shield may be associated with a higher incidence of pelvic infection than other intrauterine devices may have been unjustified...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} our method for retrieval of lost intrauterine devices (IUDs) either with or without strings in an office-based setting. Methods: A total of 38 women underwent retrieval of lost IUD. After preevaluation with ultrasonography and hysteroscopy, a Lin polyp grasper {{was used to remove}} the IUD under ultrasound monitoring without using a simultaneous hysteroscopy. Results: Out of 38 women, 12 (31. 6 %) had IUD insertion for 10 – 19 years, whereas in another 12 women (31. 6 %), the duration was 20 – 40 years. Participants were divided into two groups: (1) premenopausal group (n =  21). The removed IUDs were 11 Chinese IUDs, seven FD- 1 IUDs, one Yusei ring IUD, one <b>Lippe</b> <b>loop</b> IUD, and one Mirena IUD; and (2) postmenopausal group (n =  17). The removed IUDs were five soft type Ota ring IUDs, eight FD- 1 IUDs, one Saf-T-Coil IUD, one KS wing IUD, and one Chinese IUD. A very hard type Ota ring IUD inserted for 40 years could not be removed. All of the other IUDs were removed uneventfully. Most of the patients could tolerate the procedure without the use of analgesia or anesthesia. No subsequent complication except bleeding for several days was encountered. Conclusion: Using our method, lost IUDs either with or without strings can be effectively and safely retrieved in the office-based setting without analgesia or anesthesia...|$|R
50|$|Jack Lippes helped {{begin the}} {{increase}} of IUD use in the United States in the late 1950s. In this time, thermoplastics, which can bend for insertion and retain their original shape, became the material used for first-generation IUDs. Lippes also devised {{the addition of the}} monofilament nylon string, which facilitates IUD removal. His trapezoid shape <b>Lippes</b> <b>Loop</b> IUD {{became one of the most}} popular first-generation IUDs. In the following years, many different shaped plastic IUDs were invented and marketed. These included the infamous Dalkon Shield, whose poor design caused bacterial infection and led to thousands of lawsuits. Although the Dalkon shield was removed from the market, it had a lasting, negative impact on IUD use and reputation in the United States. Lazar C. Margulies developed the first plastic IUD using thermoplastics in the 1960s. His innovation allowed insertion of the IUD into the uterus without the need to dilate the cervix.|$|E
40|$|A {{multinational}} comparative {{trial of}} three IUDs (Copper 7, <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> size D and the Postpartum T) randomly inserted immediately following {{delivery of the}} placenta was conducted in six centres. A total of 841 women entered the study. As the predetermined termination indices for expulsions were exceeded at six months the trial was prematurely closed. An excess of expulsions during the first 48 hours following insertion was observed for the <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> {{compared to the other}} devices. At six months the expulsion rate for the <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> was significantly higher than that for the Copper 7. In addition, the discontinuation rate for the <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> at 12 months was significantly higher than that for the Copper 7. There {{were no significant differences in}} either the expulsion rates or the discontinuation rate at six or twelve months between the postpartum T and the other devices. At 12 months the pregnancy rates with all three devices was high; there were no ectopic pregnancies. Considerable between-centre differences were observed, particularly for expulsion rates. Possible reasons for this are discussed and future research lines are suggested. © 1980. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

30|$|Insertion of an IUD to {{separate}} the endometrial layers after lysis of IUAs has been described for many years [7, 49, 77]. Copper-containing and T-shaped IUDs cannot be recommended because of their inflammation-provoking properties [78] and small surface area [79], respectively. An inert loop IUD (e.g., <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop)</b> is considered the IUD of choice when treating IUAs [4], although {{it is no longer}} available in many geographic areas. In a prospective comparative study of 71 women, the use of second-look hysteroscopy was evaluated following insertion of a <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> and estrogen and progestin treatment for 2  months [77]. Women in group 1 underwent early repeat hysteroscopy at 1  week and then reassessment following removal of the IUD at 2  months following index procedure. Group 2 did not have an early repeat hysteroscopy. There was no difference in pregnancy rates or live births and no comparison to women not having an IUD. A randomized study compared an IUD in 80 women with an intrauterine balloon stent in 82 women, each placed for 1  week following hysteroscopic treatment of adhesions [80]. The outcome measure was hysteroscopically rated adhesion score at 1 to 2  months following index treatment, and this study reported no difference in adhesion reformation rate between the balloon group (30 %) and the IUD group (35 %). This study did not report pregnancy outcomes or compare adhesions in women not receiving any postoperative intervention. In a small nonrandomized study, postoperative IUD plus hormone therapy was compared with hormone therapy alone, with no significant difference reported for adhesion reformation [81]. The risk of infection when an IUD is introduced into the uterus immediately after adhesiolysis is estimated to be 8 % [82], and perforation of the uterus during IUD insertion has been reported [82].|$|E
30|$|Dajani et al. {{described}} {{a case of}} a 26 -year old woman, gravida 2, para 1, who presented with failure to conceive 18  months after removal of a <b>Lippes</b> <b>Loop</b> IUD worn for 12  months [26]. The IUD had been inserted following a miscarriage at 18  weeks gestation, in which vaginal evacuation was bloody and difficult. The patient had a normal menstrual cycle and normal blood loss. The pelvic ultrasonogram showed a persistent focus of intrauterine illumination, and hysterosalpingography revealed an irregularity in the right cornu. Results of laparoscopy were negative. Four thin plates of bone, each 10  mm in the long axis, were removed at an exploratory dilatation and curettage. Microscopic examination showed necrotic bony trabeculae and bone marrow in the intervening spaces. A pregnancy test was positive 3  months later, and the patient gave birth to a healthy female weighing 3.3  kg [26]. In both this and the similar reported case in the previous paragraph, the bone fragments were located in the fundus. The contraceptive action was possibly related to an increase of prostaglandin concentration in the fundal endometrium, which is a common site for blastocyst implantation.|$|E
40|$|Background: To present {{experience}} with clinical presentation, diagnosis and minimally invasive removal of migrated {{intrauterine contraceptive device}} (IUD). Methods: A total of 6 patients were included in retrospective study. Diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, TVS and Abdominopelvic X- ray. Minimally invasive approach was utilized to remove migrated IUD. Results: The mean (range) age of the patient was 36. 6 (26 - 55) years. The mean (range) of parity was 3. 5 (2 - 6). The mean (range) duration of IUD use was 8. 1 (3 - 25) years. Five patients had TCu 380 A IUD. One patient had <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop</b> type of IUD. Three patients underwent laparoscopy, two had hysteroscopy and one had cystoscopy, for removal of IUD. The mean (range) operative time was 40. 8 (18 - 76) mins. No anesthesia or surgery related complications were observed intraoperatively. The mean (range) duration of hospital stay was 34 (24 - 48) hours. The postoperative course was uneventful and all the patients were followed for 3 - 6 months period of time with no complaints. Conclusion: Removal of migrated IUDs is recommended in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using minimally invasive approach.

30|$|Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) {{can lead}} to hypomenorrhoea, {{pregnancy}} wastage (including first- and second-trimester miscarriage), errors of placental implantation (placenta accreta, increta and percreta) and infertility. Prior to the advent of hysteroscopy, diagnosis of intrauterine adhesions (IUA) was based on history of hypomenorrhoea and HSG findings of single or multiple irregular filling defects; however, the diagnosis can only be made with certainty only when there is direct inspection of the uterine cavity. Once the diagnosis is made, the aim of treatment is restoration of uterine architecture to normal, to prevent readherence of the uterine walls, to provide stimulation for endometrial growth over the freshly dissected surfaces and to verify that the uterine cavity is normal prior to any attempts at ART. Insertion of the hysteroscope should be under direct vision. Attempts to identify normal landmarks, such as the tubal ostia, are made initially. The extent and thickness of the IUA are first noted. If no landmarks are identified and if the hysteroscope cannot be advanced safely, laparoscopy is performed before further hysteroscopic efforts are made. Once the pelvis is inspected, the light intensity for the laparoscope is reduced markedly. Hysteroscopic division is now resumed. If the hysteroscopic lysis is advertently carried into the myometrium, {{the light from the}} hysteroscope will shine brightly through the uterine serosa. Hysteroscopic dissection should then be redirected in order to prevent uterine perforation. Miniature scissors are used to divide adhesions under direct vision. An inert intrauterine device is inserted into the cavity in order to prevent readherence. Inert devices, such as the <b>Lippes</b> <b>loop,</b> are preferred as they have a larger surface area than the common T-shape IUD and cause less intrauterine reaction than those which release copper. Another option is inflation of the balloon of a 10 -F Foley catheter in the endometrial cavity. This is retained for 5 – 7  days. All patients are prescribed conjugated estrogen 2.5  mg twice daily for 60 consecutive days. Progesterone withdrawal bleeding is induced from day 56 to 60 and the IUD removed. An outpatient hysteroscopy should then be performed to rule out readherence.|$|E
