5|$|Notable Weiquan Lawyers include He Weifang, Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, Guo Feixiong and Chen Guangcheng, Gao Zhisheng, Zheng Enchong, and Li Heping. Many barefoot <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> peasants {{who teach}} {{themselves}} enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights. Some Weiquan <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> the pragmatists {{and some are}} more radical.|$|E

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

50|$|Bag-ao {{believes}} that alternative <b>lawyering</b> <b>is</b> {{not simply a}} career but an advocacy for a particular {{way of life for}} lawyers and legal advocates; alternative <b>lawyering</b> <b>is</b> a life that is not based on sacrifices and compromises, but a choice and a lifelong commitment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lawyers</b> <b>were</b> also {{targeted}} by police. On 11 June at least 20 lawyers gathering at the Istanbul Çağlayan Justice Palace {{to make a}} press statement about Gezi Park were detained by police, including riot police. The arrests of total 73-74 <b>lawyers</b> <b>were</b> described as [...] "very brutal and anti-democratic" [...] by one lawyer present, with many injured: [...] "They even kicked their heads, the <b>lawyers</b> <b>were</b> on the ground. They were hitting us they were pushing. They built a circle around us and then they attacked." ...|$|R
5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend {{the civil rights of}} the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E

5000|$|A cause lawyer, {{also known}} as a public {{interest}} lawyer or social <b>lawyer,</b> <b>is</b> a <b>lawyer</b> dedicated to the usage of law for the promotion of social change. Cause <b>lawyering</b> <b>is</b> commonly described as a practice of [...] "lawyering for the good" [...] or using law to empower members of the weaker layers of society. It {{may or may not be}} performed pro bono. Cause <b>lawyering</b> <b>is</b> frequently practiced by individual lawyers or lawyers employed by associations that aim to supply a public service as a complementary to the State provided legal aid.|$|R

25|$|It {{is often}} the {{experience}} of the Roma that on pressing charges in relation to police brutality, a counter- charge is often threatened by law enforcement, in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges, which is particularly effective as the attitude toward the roma in slovakia is so entrenched that <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> often reluctant to represent Romani victims.|$|E

25|$|The courts {{generally}} {{follow the}} non-acquittals policy; in 2004 acquittals constituted only 0.7 {{percent of all}} judgments.

There was a rapid deterioration of the situation characterized by abuse of the criminal process, harassment and persecution of defense bar members in politically sensitive cases in recent years. The principles of adversariness and equality of the parties to criminal proceedings are not observed.|$|E
