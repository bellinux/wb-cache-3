40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the applicability of}} mastication as a fuel treatment alternative within Northern Rocky Mountain moist and dry forests to treat post-harvest activity slash (moist forest) and standing trees (dry forest). On the moist forest site, we compared four different slash treatments, mastication, machine grapple piling, <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter,</b> <b>and</b> a control within a wildland urban interface setting {{to determine the effects}} of these treatments on soil nutrition, forest floor depth, and woody debris distributions. We randomly assigned the slash treatments and controls to 12 one-acre plots. Nitrogen, soil carbon, and magnesium concentrations within the soil components were not significantly different among the slash treatments. <b>Lopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>scattered</b> sites had significantly here duff depths than duff depths within the other slash treatments and control. Two years after treatment the structure and character of the masticated fuels was such that these areas resembled the grapple piled sites. We established the dry forest site to treat excess standing non-commercial 80 -year old ponderosa pine. We masticated 20 acres in the fall; six one-acre plots were randomly located within the masticated area. We applied prescribed fire the following spring to three of the plots the remaining three plots were post-masticated controls. During the prescribed fire, flame lengths were low (3 ̆c 0. 5 m), although combustion continued to occur from smoldering. The radiation and convection was of sufficient intensity that crown scorching raised canopy base heights by 3 to 5 m. A critical element of the prescription was that lower duff moistures had to be greater than 100 percent during burning, therefore, there was little to no consumption of the forest floor even with the smoldering fire. Based on these results, we recommend that when burning masticated material particular attention to lower duff moisture is critical to minimize the down ward heat pulse...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{has been}} linked to the {{regeneration}} of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) [Lindley] Buchholz but no studies have directly investigated the effects of opening size and fuel treatment on giant sequoia establishment. Giant sequoia seedling density was analyzed in 36 group selection openings harvested in 1993 at Mountain Home Demonstration State Forest, CA. The experiment consisted of four replicates of a randomized 3 3 factorial design which investigated the effects of opening size and fuel treatment on giant sequoia regeneration. Small, medium, and large circular openings had average diameters of 15, 30, and 61 m, respectively. A total of 12 large, 12 medium, and 12 small openings were created. Three fuel treatments were randomly applied to the openings: tractor pile and burn, broadcast burn, <b>and</b> <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter.</b> Analysis of variance (ANOVA) detected no signi®cant differences between treatments and seedling density (p < 0. 05). All the treatments had low giant sequoia seedling density regardless of opening size or fuel treatment. Regeneration was completely absent in all openings with the <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> fuel treatment while small openings had low giant sequoia regeneration density regardless of fuel treatment. Giant sequoia seedling density was low because of below average annual and summer precipitation following the creation of the openings and of low seed dispersal.

50|$|For {{the burning}} of slash, waste {{materials}} left over from logging, there are several types of controlled burns. Broadcast burning is {{the burning of}} scattered slash over a wide area. Pile burning is gathering up the slash into piles before burning. These burning piles may {{be referred to as}} bonfires. High temperatures can harm the soil, damaging it physically, chemically or sterilizing it. Broadcast burns tend to have lower temperatures and will not harm the soil as much as pile burning, though steps can be taken to treat the soil after a burn. In <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> burning, slash is left to compact over time, or is compacted with machinery. This produces a lower intensity fire, as long as the slash is not packed too tightly. However, soil may be damaged if machinery is used to compress the slash.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Despite {{the belief}} that fuels management, a form of {{prescribed}} fire that reduces accumulated fuels in commercially thinned forests, is necessary to restore forest 'health' in the Pacific Northwest, its effects on wildlife has received little attention in the scientific literature. Because fuels management is supported, funded, and implemented nationwide under the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, {{it is imperative to}} understand how these management activities affect wildlife. In this field experiment, I used mark-recapture methods to examine community, population, and individual responses of small mammals one year following three fuels-management treatments (<b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter,</b> pile, <b>and</b> pile/bum) in three commercially thinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest stands within the Applegate Adaptive Management Area of southwest Oregon. Fifteen species were captured during two years of study, and I found that fuels treatments did not appear to affect species richness or evenness, nor did they affect population densities and survival of the two most abundant species, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and western red-backed vole (Clethrionomys californicus). In study plots where fuels provided variable distributions and amounts of cover, only deer mice used piled fuels significantly more than available while randomly using fuels that were <b>lopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>scattered.</b> Deer mouse numbers decreased and their home ranges increased with increasing distance from piled fuels. Thus, it appears that although these three fuels treatments do not affect the population density of deer mice in my study area, piled fuels do affect the distribution and home range size of individuals within these populations, leading to a shift in their local distribution. I hypothesize that environmental conditions created by the open canopy following thinning in this study may have led to poor-quality forest-floor habitat for small mammals, which could have dampened small mammal community- and population-level responses one year following fuels treatments. I recommend that future studies of wildlife responses to fuels management in the Pacific Northwest consider interactions between commercial thinning, fuels management, and regional climate conditions...|$|R
30|$|Thinning without {{subsequent}} slash reduction {{has been}} shown in simulation studies to be less effective than prescribed fire in reducing potential wildland fire behavior (van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Agee and Skinner 2005, Stephens and Moghaddas 2005). This study indicated that thinning, without slash reduction because of the helicopter yarding method used, increased surface fire behavior and brought stands close to historic basal area levels. The slash left after logging, plus smaller trees that were not logged, were treated after the thinning with a <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> method. This expensive additional cost might not occur after every thinning operation, but can aid subsequent survival of residual trees (Agee and Skinner 2005). However, addition of dead fuels from thinning or insect outbreaks (Hummel and Agee 2003), or removal by prescribed fire, does not simply translate into altered fire hazard or severity. Fuelbed depth, surface-area-to-volume ratios, and distribution of loading by size class are fuel model parameters in addition to total loading that will affect fire behavior.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of clearcutting and slash treatment on understory plant species composition in Rocky Mountain coniferous forests, we collected comparable data from 30 - to 50 -year-old post-harvest stands and adjacent mature (> 100 -year-old) stands that originated after wildfire. In general, plant species richness was higher in the post-harvest stands than in adjacent mature stands, {{due in large part to}} the presence of species that benefit from disturbance. Species composition in post-harvest and mature stands was more similar in montane forests (2710 – 2805 m elevation) than in subalpine forests(2800 – 3164 m elevation), suggesting greater resilience of montane understories. Composition in post-harvest and mature stands was least similar when slash was piled and burned, and most similar when slash was <b>lopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>scattered.</b> Eighty-seven percent of the post-harvest stands had at least one exotic species, but total cover of exotic plant species in all post-harvest stands was ≤ 1 %. Exotic species were largely absent from mature forests. Our results suggest that understory species of low-elevation montane forests recover more quickly from disturbance than do those of subalpine forests, with slash treatment and species life history traits strongly influencing this recovery...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{harvesting}} timber is {{one method}} of reducing fuel continuity and subsequent potential fire behavior, the residual slash can greatly increase the surface fuel loading and subsequent risk of wildfire on harvested sites. Fire behavior following silvicultural treatments to a stand can vary greatly, with both depth and loading playing {{a significant role}} (Nives 1989). Surface fuels and subsequent potential fire behavior {{has been shown to}} increase in the first year after harvest in coast redwood forests (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) (Dicus 2003), which threatens not only natural resources but also structures in an ever-increasing wildland-urban interface. Alternatively, logging slash may serve to hold post-harvest soil in place, thereby decreasing soil erosion and stream sedimentation, which may be of greater importance than fire risk in some areas. Logging operations, particularly roads, can significantly increase erosion rates in coastal forests (Amaranthus et al., 1985). Slash may reduce the detrimental effects of harvesting impacts by decreasing raindrop impact and subsequent soil movement. This research examined surface fuel loading, potential fire behavior, and soil erosion following a single-tree selection harvest <b>and</b> subsequent <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter</b> slash treatment in coast redwood stands near Aptos, California. The specific objectives were to (1) quantify fuel loading and potential fire behavior before and for three years after a selective harvest, and (2) determine if residual slash affected surface soil erosion...|$|R
40|$|The future {{resilience}} of Pinus radiata D. Don (Monterey pine) {{is dependent upon}} {{the development of a}} silviculture program inclusive of either preventative or management techniques for the potentially fatal pitch canker disease (Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg and O’Donnell [=F. subglutinans (Wollenw. 2 ̆ 6 Reinking) Nelson et al. f. sp. Pini). As an ecologically and commercially valued species, a myriad of factors threaten the genetic resources of the geographically limited natural range. This study evaluated the effectiveness of uneven-aged forest management for regeneration success in the native, pitch canker infected Año Nuevo stand at Swanton Pacific Ranch in Davenport, California. Seedling survival and growth averages were used to evaluate the impact of the variables of gap size (0. 20 -hectare, 0. 10 -hectare, and 0. 05 -hectare), site-preparation treatment (pile <b>and</b> burn, <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter),</b> <b>and</b> parent tree (13 local seed sources). Pitch canker symptoms were quantified to conclude if there is indeed a range of expressed resistance according to parent tree. Statistical models (i. e. ‘mixed effect’) yielded moderately significant differences in odds of survival between site treatments, with pile and burn plots producing higher survival rates (p= 0. 066). No significant difference in survival was detected between gap-sizes (p= 0. 936 and 0. 803, 0. 05 - and 0. 10 -hectare gaps respectively to 0. 20 -hectare reference). Significant variation was expressed (estimate= 0. 1219, SE= 0. 057) between the 13 parent trees, implicating usefulness in predicting seedling survival. ‘Mixed effect’ models only detected a significant effect from gap-size on growth measures: 0. 20 -hectare gaps yielded height and diameter measures significantly larger than 0. 05 -hectare gaps (p= 0. 027 and 0. 0081 respectively). Contingency tables detected significant association between gap-size and number of pitch canker branch symptoms. The range of infection rates produced by the 13 parent trees did not prove significant by analysis. Pile and burn site preparation treatment increases the probability of survival for artificially regenerated seedlings and 0. 20 -hectare gaps yield significantly higher growth averages over 0. 05 -hectare gaps...|$|R

Stands targeted for tree removal were primarily in the middle stages of juniper encroachment (Phase II, 7 851 ha). Trees were removed using hand felling combined with either <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>scatter,</b> single tree burning, or jackpot burning, which were carried out to minimize loss of shrub cover. Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri) density was greater at treated versus untreated portions of the study area. At sites {{in the third year}} following tree removal, Brewer’s sparrow density was 23. 6 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 19. 4 – 27. 8) territories per km 2 higher than locations that had not yet been treated. This equates to a net increase of 1 212 − 1 737 nesting pairs within the project area. Green-tailed towhee increased by 4. 6 (95 % CI: 3. 1 – 6. 1) territories per km 2 for an estimated project-wide increase of 194 – 381 nesting pairs, and vesper sparrow (Poocetes gramineus) increased by 6. 5 (95 % CI: 4. 6 – 8. 4) territories per km 2 corresponding to an estimated increase of 460 – 559 nesting pairs within the project area. Density of gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrighti) was lower in cut areas, and over the entire project area we estimate a net loss of 183 – 486 nesting pairs as a result of juniper tree removal. This study demonstrates that conifer removal projects designed to retain shrub cover and structure can have benefits to multiple species of ground and shrub nesting birds, including several species of conservation concern...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For a {{wireless}} communications network, Local Pool-ing (LoP) is a desirable property {{due to its}} sufficiency for the optimality of low-complexity greedy scheduling techniques. However, LoP in network graphs with a primary interference model requires an edge sparsity that may be prohibitive to other desirable properties in wireless networks, such as connectivity. In this paper, we investigate {{the impact of the}} edge density on both <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> the size of the largest component under the primary interference model, as the number of nodes in the network grows large. For both Erdős-Rényi (ER) and random geometric (RG) graphs, we employ threshold functions to establish crit-ical values for either the edge probability or communication radius necessary for these properties to hold. These thresholds demonstrate that <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> connectivity (or even the presence of a giant component) cannot both hold asymptotically as the network grows in size for a large class of edge probability or communication radius functions. We then use simulation to explore this problem in the regime of small network sizes, which suggests the probability that an ER or RG graph satisfies <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> contains a giant component decays quickly with the size of the network.

40|$|Since in {{patients}} with Cushing's disease, unlike in normal subjects, tonic inhibitory opioid control of ACTH secretion does not operate, use of the opiate agonist loperamide (LOP) has recently been proposed in the diagnosis of hypercortisolemic states. We compared the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the LOP test (16 mg orally) with corresponding results of the dexamethasone test (DXM, 1 mg orally overnight) in 23 normal subjects and {{in a total of}} 42 patients, affected by Cushing's disease (n = 8), incidentally discovered adrenal masses with impaired function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (n = 6), obesity (n = 21) and depression (n = 7). While in controls both DXM <b>and</b> <b>LOP</b> strongly suppressed plasma cortisol and ACTH, in Cushing's disease and in incidentalomas no patient showed a decrease in cortisol levels below 50 ng/ml or a reduction in plasma cortisol greater than 50 % of basal values in response to <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM. In obese subjects both drugs significantly reduced plasma cortisol and ACTH without giving false positive results. In the depressed group only 3 / 7 patients showed a decrement in cortisol levels below 50 ng/ml after LOP in contrast to 6 / 7 after DXM. Thus, {{in patients}} with impairment of the HPA-axis, i. e. in Cushing's disease and {{in patients with}} adrenal incidentalomas <b>and</b> hormonal abnormalities, <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM test sensitivity was 100 %. In controls and in obese patients specificity was 100 % both with <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM, while in depressed patients it was 43 % and 86 % with <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM, respectively. In conclusion, since the diagnostic accuracy of the LOP test (94. 9 %) is slightly lower as compared to DXM (98. 5 %), use of loperamide gives no additional advantages in diagnosis of hypercortisolemic states. However, in account of its good specificity, the LOP test may be considered a complementary diagnostic procedure to DXM in pathological conditions such as obesity in which the DXM test may give false positive results...|$|R
