40|$|Operation Musketeer, a {{combined}} joint Anglo-French operation aimed at regaining {{control of the}} Suez Canal in 1956, has received much attention from scholars. The most common approach to the crisis has been to examine the political dimension. The political events that led Prime Minister Anthony Eden’s cabinet to decide {{to use military force}} against the wishes of their superior American ally and in the face of American economic pressure and a Soviet threat to attack Paris and <b>London</b> with <b>rockets</b> have been analysed thoroughly. This is particularly the case because the ceasefire and eventual withdrawal were an indisputable defeat of British policy in the Middle East. The military operation not only ruined Prime Minister Eden’s career, but it also diminished the prestige of Britain. It {{was the beginning of the}} end, some claim. The British Empire would never be the same. As the consequences of using force are generally considered more important than the military operations themselves, very little attention has been paid to the military planning of Operation Musketeer. The difference between the number of publications on Operation Corporate of the Falklands War and Operation Musketeer is striking. Not only has there been little previous research on the military aspects of Musketeer, the conclusions drawn in the existing works have not reached a consensus. Some historians, such as Correlli Barnett, compare Musketeer to the utter failures of the Tudor landings and Gallipoli. Among significant politicians, Winston Churchill, who had retired from the prime ministership only a year before the Suez Crisis, described the operation as “the most ill-conceived and ill-executed imaginable”. Colin McInnes, a well-known author on British defence policy, represents the middle view when he describes the execution as “far from failure”. Finally, some, like Julian Thompson, the Commander of 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, rate the military action itself as being successful. The interpretation of how successful the handling of the Suez Crisis was from the military point of view depends very much on the approach taken and the areas emphasised in the subject. Frequently, military operations are analysed in isolation from other events. The action of a country’s armed forces is separated from the wider context and evaluated without a solid point of comparison. Political consequences are often used as validated criteria, and complicated factors contributing to military performance are ignored. The lack of comprehensive research on the military action has left room for an analysis concentrating on the military side of the crisis...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{an example of}} how cities can be {{affected}} by large scale destruction and subsequent reconstruction, through the case study of post WW 2 <b>London</b> bombing and <b>rocket</b> damage and rebuild. This is viewed with the idea that there was a promised effort by planners of the period to move to a more Utopian city layout for London as set forth in the ideals of Ebenezer Howard's Garden Cities of To-Morrow. This thesis seeks to answer three questions: (1) What impact did the Blitz Bombings/V Strikes of WW 2 have on London? (2) Which green space or public areas around today were created {{as a result of the}} bombings? (3) Did the urban planners apply E. Howard's Garden City Theory to the restructuring of land use as promised? This has been done by the use of a comparative GIS exercise utilising pre and post War maps of six London boroughs forming the study area, and an aggregate of bomb and rocket incidents recorded from various sources, to determine which areas which has been previously urban in nature and then damaged were rebuilt as a Green or Open Space. Emphasis was placed on transformation of the old and new maps as well as categorisation of the various Green and Open Space types. The findings of this thesis were that although the damage to urban areas was extensive during this period, the overall layout of London did not change significantly in terms of Green and Open spaces, and any changes that were made were opportunistic rather than a noted trend towards Howard's ideals. It also offers commentary on the process of utilising pre-GIS maps in a modern context and its shortcomings in terms of data accuracy...|$|R

Both ground vegetation and almond trees were most commonly infected with the almond strain of Xf (6 of 7 surveyed sites). ALS-infected almond samples had a Xf concentration within reported ranges, however, we were unable to accurately measure Xf titer in sampled ground vegetation for comparison...|$|E
40|$|Solarization is {{a method}} of soil {{disinfestation}} that relies upon high temperatures to reduce populations of pest organisms in the soil (Stapleton and De Vay 1986). Soil temperatures above 45 C {{have been found to}} reduce emergence of seeds of annual weed species (Horowitz et al. 1983, Peachey et al. 2001). While solarization has promise as a potential alternative to soil fumigation, specific guidelines for treatment are lacking (Stapleton et al. 2000). Time and temperature requirements for thermal death have already been determined for seeds of six weed species (annual sowthistle, barnyardgrass, black nightshade, common purslane, <b>London</b> <b>rocket,</b> and tumble pigweed) at temperatures reached during solarization (Dahlquist et al. 2007). We determined the time required for thermal death for seeds of two additional weed species, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) and black mustard (Brassica nigra L.), at 50 C. Seeds were placed in organdy bags and allowed to imbibe water at room temperature for 2 hours before heat treatment. Seed bags were placed in 0. 47 -L mason-type canning jars filled with 30 -grit silica sand wetted to field capacity (10. 4 % moisture) with deionized water and maintained at 50 C in a water bath. Six jars per species were maintained at 50 C, and three jars were kept at room temperature as controls. In each experiment, three to four bags of seeds were placed i...|$|E
40|$|A "double-tent " {{solarization}} technique, which develops higher {{soil temperatures}} than solarization of open fields, was recently {{approved by the}} California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) as a nematicidal treatment for containerized nursery production. The technique was tested for effect as an herbicidal treatment. Laboratory-derived thermal death dosages (temperature x time) for six weed species important in California [Portulaca oleracea (common purslane), Amaranthus albus (tumble pigweed), Sonchus oleraceus (annual sowthistle), Sisymbrium irio (<b>London</b> <b>rocket),</b> Solanum nigrum (black nightshade), and Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) ] were determined, as previously reported. In a field validation of the laboratory data, moist soil which was placed in black polyethylene (poly) planting bags containing seeds of the six test species was subjected to 24 hours of solarization after reaching a threshold temperature of 60 C (2 hours after initiation of the experiment). Other samples of weed seeds were incubated under ambient temperature (ca. 23 C). Samples were removed at 2, 4, 20, and 24 hours after reaching the 60 C threshold. They were then incubated at ca. 7 C for 12 weeks to ameliorate possible secondary dormancy effects. After the cold treatment, seeds were moistened and incubated at a temperature regimen of 16 hours at 30 C and 8 hours at 20 C, with exposure to a fluorescent grow-light during the 30 C cycle. Apart from the non-solarized control treatment, no weed seeds germinated {{at any of the}} sampling periods, in accordance with the laboratory thermal death data. The "double-tent " solarization technique may be useful to many growers of containerized plants in warmer areas of California...|$|E
40|$|At three test sites, {{ethofumesate}} (Nortron®) at 1. 0 and 2. 0 lb AI /A {{was safe}} on onions. Nortron appeared to provide marginal control {{of light to}} moderate weed infestations of <b>London</b> <b>rocket</b> (Sisymbrium irio) at two sites. Pendimethalin (Prowl®) at 0. 50 and 0. 75 lb Al/A was safe on onions at two sites with furrow irrigation. At three sites with sprinkler irrigation, Prowl treatments caused as high as 62 to 88 % stand reduction when sprinklers were used to incorporate the herbicide. Bensulide (Prefar 0) injured onions at early rating dates and height measurements indicated that the plants were shortened relative to the untreated check. End of the season visual observations showed that onions had grown out of the initial injury and the crop {{did not appear to}} be damaged. Prefar combined with Prowl or Nortron was more injurious to onions with sprinkler irrigation than with furrow irrigated incorporation. Prefar gave marginal weed control in the tests under conditions with low weed infestations. Lactofen (Cobra®) was injurious to onions at all five test sites and caused significant crop stand reduction. Combination treatments of Prowl with DCPA (Dacthal®) or Prefar were damaging to onions under sprinklers but injury was minimal with furrow irrigations. Metolachlor (Dual®) and dimethenamid (Frontier®) caused minimal injury and no stand reduction of onions under sprinklers but with furrow irrigation, the stand was reduced and height reduction was substantial. The series of field tests demonstrated that herbicide performance was significantly influenced by irrigation practices. Prowl herbicide was extremely injurious and caused substantial crop stand reduction with sprinkler irrigation. Dual and Frontier exhibited less injury on onions under sprinklers than with furrow irrigation. Cobra at 0. 25 lb AI /A was damaging to onions regardless of irrigation practice...|$|E
