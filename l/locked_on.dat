5|$|Del Piero's first {{appearance}} after the 2006 FIFA World Cup triumph {{was in a}} Coppa Italia match against Cesena on 23 August 2006. As Juventus played in the Serie B for the 2006–07 season, the Coppa Italia campaign became increasingly important for the club {{in order to achieve}} a UEFA Cup spot. Having been on vacation beforehand, Del Piero started on the bench. Juventus and Cesena were <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> 1–1 when Del Piero entered in the 74th minute and after nine seconds, he scored the winning goal for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed and <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match on}} the card was the main event, which saw The Undertaker face off against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) in a Handicap match. Per the pre-match stipulation, Paul Bearer would be {{cemented}} in a glass crypt if Undertaker lost. Throughout {{the duration of the}} match, Bearer was <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> a chair inside a glass crypt with the pump of cement truck above him. After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys, Undertaker pinned D-Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win. After the match, Undertaker pulled the lever to the cement truck, which in turn filled the crypt with Bearer inside full of cement.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a {{standard}} match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. The match started with Masters applying the Masterlock on Michaels. After breaking the hold, Michaels delivered a clothesline and knife edged chops. Masters, however, dominated Michaels, focusing {{on his back}} by powerbombing Michaels several times. He also lifted Michaels vertically {{in the air and}} stalled him there before slamming him down. Michaels fought back, as he delivered a Diving Elbow Drop. Masters was able to lock in the Masterlock once more. Michaels tried to use the corners to break the hold, but Masters kept it <b>locked</b> <b>on.</b> Michaels then leaped over the top rope and landed on the ring apron, causing the referee to order Masters to break the hold. Michaels countered with a Sweet Chin Music, thus Michaels got the pinfall victory over Masters.|$|E
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

25|$|Anchorage at Valletta was a {{boon for}} career officers, but the {{conditions}} for conscripted sailors, locked in the holds or engaged in hard work, were atrocious. The crew of Alexander Nevsky openly revolted and was promptly suppressed by Geiden.

25|$|Characters on {{reaching}} Level 15 {{can purchase}} {{a house in}} instanced neighborhoods. Neighbourhoods and houses have different themes depending on setting (there are four settings: Man, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit). Decorations/furniture may be purchased or acquired as rewards in certain in-game activities such as quests, deeds or festivals. The items are displayed via item hooks and may be either cosmetic or functional. Houses come in three different sizes and include chests for additional player storage. Houses require weekly maintenance rent (using in-game currency) with houses <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> failure to pay upkeep. The largest size house is reserved for kinships (player guilds). Players can own one personal house per server, and restrict the level of access to himself only, kinship members, or make it publicly accessible.|$|E
25|$|Combat is fast-paced and {{requires}} an offensive approach {{in order for}} players to combat dense hordes of enemies. The player character is agile {{and is able to}} dodge attacks by strafing around enemies while <b>locked</b> <b>on.</b> The new risk-and-reward style of gameplay is emphasized through Bloodbornes Rally system, which allows the player to, within a small window of time, recover portions of lost health by striking an enemy. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that this is representative of the player's increased will to continue after successfully striking an enemy. A New Game Plus mode is also present; after the player has finished the game, a new game will immediately be started. New Game Plus is optional, players retain all their equipment, and the game is harder than the previous play through.|$|E

25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. Not willing {{to let him go}} on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E
25|$|Attacking in a {{climbing}} curve {{behind the}} MiG-21's with his AIM-7 guidance radar <b>locked</b> <b>on,</b> Ritchie was given continuous range updates by DeBellevue. With his Phantom barely making enough speed to overtake the targets, Ritchie launched two Sparrows from over four miles away. The firing {{parameters of the}} two shots {{were out of the}} missiles' performance envelope, an attempt to influence the MiGs to turn and thus shorten the range. Both shots not only missed but failed to influence the opponents. Moments later, tracking one MiG visually by the contrail it was making, Ritchie fired his remaining two Sparrows, also at long range. The first missed, but the MiG made a hard turn and actually shortened the range, and was destroyed by the second. Short on fuel, Ritchie elected not to try to pursue the second MiG-21.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as {{projectiles}} such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting reticule can be moved around the <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight.|$|E

25|$|Post-production {{took place}} in Munich and {{required}} nine months to complete, concluding {{in the third quarter}} of 2006. Film editor Alex Berner was present at all the shooting locations and was on set with Tykwer. Berner also cut dailies as filming progressed which, according to Tykwer, saved a lot of time later. Tykwer said they had to work this way due to the film's tight schedule (the European release dates had already been <b>locked).</b> <b>On</b> every night of filming, Tykwer and Griebe would take screenshots from the dailies and make notes for the film laboratory on what sort of tone and palette they wanted, and the level of brightness and contrast they wanted for the prints. A digital intermediate was used for the film. About three months was spent grading the film. Digital grading tools were used to improve the color of the lavender fields because the film crew had arrived a week early and the flowers were not in full bloom. In the scene where Grenouille murders the plum girl, selective coloring was used to take the tone of the dead body's flesh from its natural color to a pale white color.|$|E
25|$|For several centuries, {{the site}} was used for {{religious}} purposes by both Hindus and Muslims. In 1822, the claim was made {{for the first time}} that the mosque stood on the site of Rama's birth, or the Ram Janmabhoomi. Citing this claim, the Hindu sect Nirmohi Akhara laid claim to the mosque, resulting in inter-communal violence in the period 1853–55. In 1949, an idol of Rama was surreptitiously placed inside the mosque, and an attempt was made to convince devotees that it had appeared miraculously. An official investigation concluded that the mosque had been desecrated and the idol placed there by three men, together with a large band of supporters. This caused an uproar among Muslim people who used the mosque, and the gates to the mosque were <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> the orders of the state government. However, in the 1980s a movement began advocating demolishing the mosque and building a temple there dedicated to Rama. Following its poor performance in the 1984 parliamentary election, the Bharatiya Janata Party shifted toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. It lent its support to the agitation for a temple at Ayodhya. In 1986, the district magistrate of Ayodhya ordered that the gates be opened once more, and Hindus be allowed access to the shrine. On the strength of this agitation, the BJP won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government.|$|E
