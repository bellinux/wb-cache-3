These rocks consist of biotite augen gneisses, and granitic/granodioriticorthogneisses, with porphyro-granoblastic textures and light gray to pink colors. Their mineralogy consists of perthitic microcline,oligoclase, quartz, besides biotite and amphibole, with epidote, titanite, chlorite, opaque minerals, apatite, zirconand allanite as accessory minerals. Petrography indicates that these rocks were affected by amphibolite facies metamorphism,and a later greenschist facies retrometamorphism. They have a prominent low-angle NW-SE foliation containing ahigh rake stretching lineation. <b>Lithogeochemistry</b> indicates high-K, metaluminous to peraluminous and calc-alkaline geochemicalsignatures related to a collisional environment. U-Pb dating of zircon (LA-ICP-MS) provided an upper interceptage of 2252 ± 17 Ma and 2171 ± 20 Ma, for the rocks found north of Florânia (RN), and east of Genezaré, respectively. Inthe latter values of 2. 84 Ga TDM and ƐNd(0) of - 20. 76 were also obtained.

In this report {{emphasis}} is given to further development of the lithogeochemical halo studies and their application to exploration for stratiform lead-zinc deposits. In this regard a database of <b>lithogeochemistry</b> for the McArthur Basin sediments has been established and background distributions for alteration vectors have been determined for the major stratigraphic units. The alteration index approach to exploration has been tested in a number of case studies; including several sub-basins in the McArthur Basin and the Kamarga Prospect on the Lawn Hill Platform. The results of this work are very exciting and confirm the importance of <b>lithogeochemistry</b> in exploration for sedex deposits. In parallel with our applied studes on alteration vectors we report on the results of more fundamental research on iron carbonate formation and its relationship to ore genesis, and fluid flow studies along the Tawallah Fault. This work will be presented at the mid-year field meeting in Darwin on 14 - 15 June followed by a field trip through the McArthur basin to visit areas relevant to the previous and on-going research program.

40|$|Zonal {{alteration}} is {{a common}} feature in volcanic rocks surrounding seafloor massive sulfide deposits. Alteration indexes such as the Ishikawa alteration index (AI) and the chlorite-carbonate-pyrite index (CCPI) {{have been developed to}} measure the intensity of sericite, chlorite, carbonate and pyrite replacement of sodic feldspars and glass associated with hydrothermal alteration proximal to the orebodies. In this paper a simple graphical representation of Ishikawa AI plotted against CCPI, termed the 'alteration box plot', is used to characterise the different alteration trends related to massive sulfide ores, and to assist in the distinction of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) -related hydrothermal alteration from regional diagenetic alteration. Although there are some limitations with the technique, a series of case studies are used to demonstrate that the alteration box plot is a powerful means of understanding the relationship between mineralogy, <b>lithogeochemistry</b> and intensity of alteration in zoned alteration systems related to VHMS deposits and should assist the exploration geologist in determining vectors to the centre of the ore system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Hornträsk deposit is a Volcanic Massive Sulfide (VMS) type deposit {{located in}} the Kristineberg area, Skellefte district, Sweden. A {{geological}} investigation was done to analyze the geology, stratigraphy and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> regarding alterations of this deposit. The results of the observations are compared to the deposits of Rävliden and Rävlidmyran. The investigation included seven drill cores within the area. From those cores 50 geochemical samples and 24 petrographical samples were taken. Lithological observations of the drill cores and thin sections indicate similar stratigraphies and structures compared to Rävlidmyran. Those observations are further supported by the geochemical results showing strong similarities between these deposits regarding the geochemistry. The results in general are further supporting the conclusion that Hornträsk {{is located on the}} same ore horizon as Rävlidmyran. This is especially based on the occurrence of the sulfide mineralization in the contact zone between the Skellefte and Vargfors Groups which is in a spatial relationship with a carbonate-rich layer...|$|E
40|$|Altered {{volcanic}} rocks {{is designed}} to be a practical guide for systematically describing and interpreting altered volcanic rocks, and determining their significance in terms of mineral deposit prospectivity. It discusses the processes and products of the common alteration styles in submarine volcanic settings, including diagenetic alteration, burial metamorphism, hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation, and intrusion-related. It takes a multi-disciplinary approach combining alteration mineralogy, textures and intensity with <b>lithogeochemistry</b> to constrain the characteristics of different alteration styles. To emphasize the ore deposit context, the book includes a major chapter that uses innovative illustrated data sheets to describe the main alteration facies or zones associated with a variety of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. The final chapter describes and presents examples of how altered rocks and their characteristics may be applied to exploration for volcanic-hosted deposits.

The Elder Creek deposit is an oxidized breccia and fault-hosted gold deposit located in the dominantly siliciclastic rocks forming the footwall to the main thrust fault. This study examined the apatite fission track thermal history, phyllosilicate mineralogy, and trace element <b>lithogeochemistry</b> of the Elder Creek deposit {{with the purpose of}} developing a genetic model for its formation. Apatite fission track results indicated two ages within analytical error of one another: 28. 9 +/- 2. 2 My and 31. 3 +/- 5. 2 My. Low temperature phyllosilicate mineralogy determined by near and shortwave infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques were limited to illite, magnesium illite, kaolinite, illite-smectite, and smectite. Antimony, arsenic and mercury anomalies were observed with increasing gold content.

Petrography and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> data suggest a bimodal suite. Felsic and mafi c magma mixing and mingling textures are locally observed indicating thepresence of coeval magmas. Nd and Sr isotope compositions correspond to EMI (Enriched Mantle I) mantle reservoir signatures,suggesting an asthenospheric enriched mantle source with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (from 0. 7049 to 0. 7061) and low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (from 0. 512361 to 0. 512428). The εNd values range from - 4. 03 to - 5. 54, indicating an anomalous enriched mantle reservoir, confi rmed by the high TDM values between 730 - 830 Ma, very different from the 72 - 56 Ma K-Ar cooling ages.

40|$|A {{practical}} application of <b>lithogeochemistry</b> to {{the classification of}} weathered serpentinites {{as to whether or}} not serpentinites are host rocks to Ni-sulphide ore is presented. An effort is made to apply existing concepts used to distinguish between fertile and sterile unweathered ultramafics to explain the observed chemical differences between fertile and sterile weathered serpentinites in southwestern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The data comprise total-attack chemical analyses for Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Si, Ti, V, and partial-attack determinations of Cu and Ni as ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide-soluble metal. Student's t-tests are used to identify element concentration differences between the two serpentinite groups. Discriminant analysis is used to classify the weathered fertile and sterile serpentinites. Non-linear mapping and fuzzy c-means clustering help to assess the validity of the discriminant analysis. Finally, chemical element associations provide extra information on geological and mineralogical causes that can be responsible for the identified differences. It is found that a clear separation and classification of weathered serpentinites is possible using the procedures presented. The observed chemical differences between fertile and sterile serpentinites are interpreted in terms of original magmatic differentiation, the degree of sulphur saturation of the original magma and the behavior of the derived ultramafic rocks in a tropical weathering environment...|$|E
40|$|Ophiolites {{are defined}} as slices of genetically-related upper mantle serpentinized peridotites and oceanic crustal rocks, tectonically {{displaced}} from its primary igneous origin of formation by plate convergence and associated (meta) sedimentary rocks of marine origin. From this premise, a meta-ultramafic-mafic-sedimentary complex (Cr-rich magnesian schists - upper mantle or crustal ultramafic cumulate candidates; epidote amphibolites, metadiorites and metagabbros - oceanic crust candidates; metasedimentary schists, quartzites and marbles - marine sedimentary rocks candidates), located in southeastern Dom Feliciano Belt (southernmost Brazil), started to be interpreted as possible slices of an ophiolitic complex related to the closure of a paleo-ocean during Brasiliano/Pan-African orogenic cycle and was called Arroio Grande Ophiolitic Complex. The present research fills the lack of geochemical data from previous studies and tests the hypothesis of an oceanic setting for the meta-igneous units of this complex from a <b>lithogeochemistry</b> point of view. The meta-ultramafics were interpreted as peridotites (mantle or crustal cumulates) that were subsequently serpentinized (probably in the ocean floor) and posteriorly metasomatized (probably in a continental setting). The meta-mafics were interpreted as oceanic gabbros/basalts formed in a back-arc basin. The results, together with field relationships, rock associations and petrographic evidences, support an oceanic origin for the protoliths of the meta-igneous units. The hypothesis that these rocks represent metamorphosed slices of an ophiolitic complex {{is still the most}} reasonable one. This work updates the geologic knowledge of the area and supports discussions about the evolution of Dom Feliciano Belt and Western Gondwana paleocontinent...|$|E
40|$|Kamojang {{geothermal}} field {{is located in}} a 1. 2 to 0. 452 Ma. Quarternary volcanic caldera system. Around the {{geothermal field}}, there are several volcanoes (cinder cones) which include: Gunung sanggar, Gunung ciharus, Gunung jawa, Gunung pasir jawa and Gunung cakra (here “gunung” means “mount”). The activity of this volcanic complex contributes greatly to the presence of Kamojang geothermal field, which forming steam dominated system with high temperature around 250 oC. The system has capacities of 260 MWe and 140 MWe. Volcanic rocks found around the geothermal field have been altered in general {{and some of them are}} difficult to be identified their initial character. Thus, it is necessary to study alteration rocks and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> of a geothermal field. Based on this idea, this study uses some methods consisting of: petrographic, geochemical and alteration box plot analysis. The analyses have been conducted for the surface samples and alteration rocks of cutting from Well KMJ- 49. This study is expected to improve the understanding on the characteristics of Kamojang geothermal field. AI and CCPI calculation results indicate that the surface samples have a value ranging from 20 to 34 AI and CCPI ranges from 63 to 73. While subsurface samples have AI values around 15 - 46 and CCPI ranges from 68 to 86.

40|$|This {{work has}} as main {{objective}} {{the characterization of}} silica-rich rocks (quartzite), {{from the standpoint of}} spectral and mineralogical patterns for structural geology purposes in the study area. This also contributes to the better knowledge of the geological environment of the surrounding region, where four lithostratigraphic groups and basement rocks occur. These units display monotonous <b>lithogeochemistry</b> characteristics and are deeply weathered. Also important is the regional tectonic context, due to the area being inserted in the Eastern margin of the Brasília Fold Belt, close to the border of the São Francisco Craton (CSF). The spectral mapping targets of interest are quartzite units of the Paranoá Group (occurring as individual layers or interbedded as metarythtmites) that sustain the relief, imparting to the area a linear zone with predominant N 300 - 400 W direction. The use of ASTER thermal images is possible identify quartzite and enhance the structural pattern in the area. These outcrops are obliterated by soil and vegetal coverages in several places. The quartz spectra displays positive and negative peak features, determinant of the wavelength interval referring to 13 and 12 ASTER bands, on order to better discriminate it from emissivity difference. The supervised classification tool SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) that measures the similarity between spectra for each image pixel, were applied as potential tool to classify quartzite areas. The results reached expected objectives. Thermal image processing allows the discrimination of the quartzite crests from enhancement of quartz spectral properties.

40|$|The Falun deposit {{is located}} in the NW part of Bergslagen in the 1. 8 - 1. 9 Ga Palaeoproterozoic, metavolcanic- {{dominated}} Falun supracrustal belt. The Falun mine is hosted in this belt and locally includes lithologies described as leptites, mica schist and quartzite along with marble, skarn, quartz porphyric intrusions and mphibolites. The entire lithological succession is metamorphosed to upper amphibolite facies and exposed to folding in at least two deformation phases to the present synformal structure. The main Falun sulphide ore bodies are concentrated in the hinge and along the limbs of the fold, replacing carbonates and hosted by the ”ore quartzite”. Falun mine was in production until 1992 by the company Stora Kopparberg, producing a total of 28 Mt polymetallic VMS-type Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-(Au) ore. This places Falun amongst the most important mines in Bergslagen and Sweden, both regarding production and historic importance. Two ore types were primarily mined: ”hard ore” of disseminated and vein-type chalcopyrite-pyrite-sphalerite with accessory minerals of pyrrhotite-magnetite-gold and vismuth minerals. The hard ore is especially known for its high copper and gold contents. The compact ore consist primarily of massive pyrite and chalcopyrite-sphalerite-galena. Within the last 30 years limited work has been done to understand the genesis of the volcanic rock and the sulphide ore. Two complicating factors in Falun is the structural geology and intense alteration which both is poorly understood. This Master thesis objective is to resolve the stratigraphy by volcanological logging and applied <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> This approach has been used with success in the Garpenberg and Dannemora mines in Bergslagen. Five drill cores from the Falun mine archive with a total length of 2800 m were relogged. Plane sections and profiles as well as a stratigraphic column were constructed based on this work. The results show that weak to moderately altered hanging wall lithologies of primary pyroclastic mass flow deposits as well as resedimented volcaniclastic deposits can be identified in Falun from primary textural observations. This is entirely new knowledge from the Falun mine. Furthermore is is shown that geochemistry can distinguish hanging wall and footwall lithologies. It is also shown that the Falun metavolcanic succession primarily has a calc-alkaline magmatic affinity with compositional range from rhyolite to rhyodacite-dacite to basalts. The volcanic facies recognized are composed of both coherent, volcaniclastic and carbonate facies. A stratigraphy with six supracrustal units has been established. This stratigraphic succession include pumicous mass flows, homogeneous and thin-very thick graded beds of silt-sandstone and carbonate-skarn. In this succession calcitic-dolomitic marble with associated diopside-hedenbergite and tremolite skarns hosts the mineralizations. Thin units,generally < 5 m thick, of coherent rhyolitic and rhyodacitic-dacitic quartz-feldspar-phyric and quartz-phyric intrusives, and basaltic amphibolites with actinolite skarn is seen throughout the succession. aluminium, ti, zr, nb and y were immobile during alteration in falun. therefore several alteration trends, in incompatible-compatible immobile element plots, suggest the presence of at least three types of intrusive phases, skarns after carbonate and mafic lithologies and a genetic relationship between the units of mass flows and silt-sandstones. the results from this work clearly show that genetic implications can be established in falun from a combination of volcanology and <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> This master thesis is merely a glimpse into the falun stratigraphy. therefore further research on old and new material could significantly improve the geological understanding of the geology in and around the falun mine.

40|$|Mo {{became very}} {{important}} in the last century, because of its sophisticated properties and its use in the new technology of alloys. Porphyry systems (porphyry Cu-Mo and Mo) contribute a significant proportion (90 - 95 per cent) to the Mo world's production. This type of deposit is associated mainly with Phanerozoic orogenic belts. Above 87 per cent of the world resources are in the American Circumpacific belts, both Andean and Cordilleran. Ore grade in porphyry Cu-Mo range from 0, 005 to 0, 04 per cent Mo, whereas in porphyry Mo grades range from 0, 08 to 0, 75 per cent Mo. These deposits {{are associated with a}} magmatism which shows an evolution from calcic in island arcs, to calc-alkaline in magmatic back arcs, with an increase of the Mo content in the same direction. Porphyry Mo deposits display several features in common with porphyry Cu deposits. hydrothermal Similarities include nature of host alteration patterns and distribution of rock intrusives, ore minerals. An interesting difference is found in the Re contents of the molybdenite mineral. This element is higher in the molybdenites of porphyry Cu, than in those of the porphyry Mo. The ore genesis process begins involves partial melting, within enriched zones of the upper mantle and magma differentation, liquid state thermogravitational diffusion, magma convection and boiling. These processes progressively concentrate Mo in the fluids, which are released at some stage, into sulphidic hydrothermal systems, under complex geologictectonic conditions involving fracturing, brecciation and hydrothermal alteration. Major concentrations of the ore mineral are always associated with potassic alteration, and with late magmatic-early hydrothermal stages (Chilean and Western North American porphyries). Geological mapping and a close understanding of alteration and mineralization patterns, and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> are important tools for the exploration of porphyry Mo deposits.

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} between bottled and tap waters {{as well as}} its {{comparison with}} current Serbian regulations, European Union Directives and World Health Organization standard are shown in this paper. Thirteen bottled waters and fourteen tap waters from the territory of Serbia were analyzed in the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) laboratory in Berlin, for the purpose of the “Geochemistry of European Bottled Water“ project conducted by EuroGeo Survey Geochemistry (EGS). Macrocomponents (main cations and anions) of ground waters usually reflect on <b>lithogeochemistry</b> of the aquifer, while microcomponents indicate the circulation of ground water through the different lithological environment. Analyzed bottled waters could be classified as those with low mineral content (M 500 mg/L) with prevailing HCO 3 anion and Na cation. Waters with low mineral content were mainly from limestone and dolomite, while mineral waters mainly originated from magmatic and metamorphic rocks. Higher content of Cs, Li, Ge, Rb and F in bottled waters indicates the importance of the magmatic intrusions influence on their chemical composition. In some waters higher content of B, I, NH 4, as well as of Tl and W has been observed which can be attributed to water’s circulation through different lithological complexes. Tap water was mostly obtained from groundwater (from Neogen and alluvial aquifers and karst springs) with rest being those of rivers and surface accumulations. Tap waters from Central Serbia were with low mineral content, with prevailing HCO 3 anion and Ca and Mg cations, while waters from Vojvodina, the northern province of Serbia, were with higher mineralization, HCO 3 -Na. Chemical analyses of the sampled tap waters showed good quality, with exception of waters from the cities of Senta and Zrenjanin in Vojvodina.

The Log(Ratio) method, utilizing ratio profiles of the immobile elements $ rm Al sb 2 O sb 3 $, TiO$ sb 2 $, Zr, Nb, Y V and Cr, was designed to identify the protoliths of the metamorphosed altered rocks. Detailed geothermobarometry and textural evidence indicate that cordierite-orthoamphibole rocks in the three terranes formed at peak P-T conditions of ${ sim} 2. 5 $ kbar and ${ sim} 55 sp circ$C at Atik Lake (andalusite zone), ${ sim} 4. 5 $ kbar ${ sim} 650 sp circ$C at Nemiscau (sillimanite zone), and ${ sim} 6. 5 $ kbar and ${ sim} 620 sp circ$C at Montauban (kyanite-sillimanite zone). Cordierite-orthoamphibole rocks in the terranes exhibit a range of bulk chemical compositions with the most Fe-rich occurring in the Atik Lake belt, and the most Mg-rich in the Montauban mine sequence. Mineral assemblages in these rocks were in equilibrium with contrasting sulfide-oxide $ pm$ arsenide fO$ sb 2 $-fS$ sb 2 $ buffers: pyrrhotite-ilmenite $ pm$ arsenopyrite $ pm$ lollingite at Atik Lake, pyrrhotite-pyrite-magnetite at Nemiscau, and pyrrhotite-rutile-sphalerite at Montauban. The partitioning of Fe-Mg between cordierite and anthophyllite was studied for use as a geobarometer. The partitioning coefficient ($ rm K sbsp{D}{Fe-Mg}$) is slightly temperature dependant and strongly pressure dependent. This new geobarometer was empirically calibrated using mineral chemistry from the three terranes and from the literature. High $ rm X sb{H sb 2 O}$ of the metamorphic fluid is required so that the X$ sb{ rm Fe}$ values of the anthophyllite will be in equilibrium under peak P-T conditions with the appropriate sulfide-oxide $ pm$ arsenide assemblage.

Houlé (GSC-Q) under the High-Mg Ultramafic to Mafic System subproject under the Targeted Geoscience Initiative IV (TGI- 4) (see Houlé et al., Article 42, this volume). Komatiite-associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposits exhibit generally a relatively small footprint and {{are becoming more and more}} difficult to find especially within poorly exposed and extensively overburden covered Archean and Proterozoic greenstone belts. It has been proposed that <b>lithogeochemistry</b> can be useful to discriminate between rocks from mineralized and barren environments (e. g., Lesher et al., 2001). However, despite the relevance of these lithiogeochemical indicators that can be used as exploration guidelines, Barnes et al. (2004) suggests that overall, the most reliable indicators of the presence of nickel sulfide mineralization is by far the presence of nickel-enriched sulfides. Recently, PGE (Platinum Group Element) content of chromite and particularly the Ru appears to be a good indicator for the presence of Ni-Cu and PGE sulfide deposits and barren komatiitic systems (Locmelis et al., 2011; Pagé et al., 2012; Locmelis et al., 2012). It has been suggested from experimental studies on the PGE fractionation that Os, l¿Ir, Rh, and Ru are included preferentially in the chromite whereas Pd and Pt stayed behind in the magma (Righter et al., 2004). Furthermore, Locmelis et al. (2011) and Pagé et al. (2012) shown that chromite from komatiites are close to the only ones to exhibit concentration above the detection limit for Os, Ir, and Ru. Based on these, we postulated that chromites from unmineralized komatiites (i. e., no sulfides present) have high concentrations of Ru and chalcophile elements in general whereas chromites from mineralized komatiites (i. e., sulfides present) have low concentrations of Ru and other chalcohiles (Figure 46. 1). In this contribution, we present the preliminary results of chromites analysis that come from mineralized and unmineralized komatiitic flows/sills at Alexo mine area in the Dundonald Township within the Abitibi greenstone belt in Ontario...|$|E
40|$|The Harker-Holloway gold camp {{is located}} along the Porcupine-Destor Deformation Zone in the {{northern}} portions of Harker and Holloway Townships, Ontario. The gold camp is host to two operating gold mines, the Holloway and Holt-McDermott mines {{as well as several}} minor gold showings. The Holloway and Holt-McDermott deposits are located entirely within splays of the Porcupine-Destor Deformation Zones within meta-volcanic rocks of the Kidd-Munro and Kinojevis lithotectonic assemblages, respectively, and are separated by a narrow band of Timiskaming meta-sedimentary rocks. The rocks of the area form a steeply south dipping package within which rocks have been deformed associated with development of the Porcupine-Destor Deformation Zone. Within the Holloway mine, a polylithic breccia folded into the volcanic stratigraphy was dated at 2686. 6 +/- 1. 8 Ma. Meta-volcanic rocks which host the two deposits belong to a tholeiitic suite of rocks and can be separated into four distinct groups based on <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> Tholeiites all have flat lying REE profiles and can be grouped into Types I, II and III based on increasing normalized REE values and are interpreted to represent a fractional crystallization trend from a tholeiitic source magma. An additional trachytic meta-volcanic unit was identified in the Holt-McDermott mine and is characterized by an enriched LREE profile and is interpreted to have formed via fractional crystallization from tholeiitic magma. Several episodes of gold mineralization have been identified in the area. The first and most economically important gold mineralizing event (Au 1) is associated with albite alteration (Ab) and pyrite mineralization (Py 1). Primary gold mineralization (Au 1) predates D 1 deformation, and is confined to specific stratigraphic units bounded by zones of intense S 1 foliation development. A second, volumetrically less important, gold mineralization (Au 2) is located within haloes of subhorizontal quartz-carbonate veins which cross cut the S 1 foliation. Secondary mineralization is associated with a sericite+carbonate alteration (Sr) and a second generation of pyrite mineralization (Py 2) and is interpreted to be a remobilization of primary gold mineralization. A third, volumetrically minor, gold mineralization event (Au 3) is associated with N to NNE striking quartz veins which cross cut all other structures. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

This means that a detailed stratigraphy is available, and a much better correlation between rock types and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> is possible for this belt. Geochemically, many of the rhyolite units are peralkaline, determined geochemically, and by the presence of sodic amphiboles and sodic pyroxenes. The REE-bearing mineral in the volcanic units was determined to be a Y-Nb oxide called fergusonite, determined via electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). Although not analyzed, allanite is also an important REE-bearing mineral found in all mineralized units. Zircon was also analyzed via EPMA, revealing that a zircon population consisting of large microporous grains was different than the general population observed in Fox Harbour. These microporous grains are believed to be 1. 05 Ga based on the limited success in obtaining U-Pb dates from them. In-situ determinations of Hf isotopes on the 1. 3 Ga zircon crystals reveal that partial melting of 1. 5 to 1. 9 Ga felsic crustal sources derived the Fox Harbour volcanic units. In-situ Hf determinations of the 1. 05 Ga zircon crystal population suggest that these zircon have the same Hf-crustal evolution array for 1. 5 to 1. 9 Ga sources. This suggests that the 1. 05 Ga metamorphism event was a closed system for Lu-Hf, and that there was no flux of REE into or out of the rocks during metamorphism...|$|E
40|$|Silurian-Devonian orogenic gold {{deposits}} in Newfoundland are typically situated proximal to major regional scale structural lineaments. Such deposits are formed in accretionary settings, {{late in the}} orogenic process with nearby intrusions of similar age, by low-salinity, H₂O-CO₂ ± CH₄ fluids at temperatures ranging from 250 - 350 °C. The White Bay area of western Newfoundland contains at least 3 styles of mineralization including structurally controlled orogenic gold- base-metal mineralization (Type 1), stratabound galena mineralization (Type 2), and minor fluorite and molybdenite occurrences (Type 3). These deposits are proximal to the Doucer's Valley fault system, an interpreted Taconic thrust surface which offsets Carboniferous strata. This fault system may have been episodically active for ca. 150 m. y. providing conduits for mineralizing hydrothermal fluids on a regional scale. [...] The Viking gold property, located 10 kilometers south {{of the community of}} Pollards Point, contains Type 1 orogenic-style gold mineralization west of the Doucer's Valley fault system in the Humber Zone. High-grade mineralization consists of coarse (50 to > 140 micron) blebby gold and argentiferous electrum hosted both within quartz veinlets and as inclusions in the sulfide assemblage (pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite) of these veinlets. <b>Lithogeochemistry</b> and previous U-Pb geochronology demonstrate that the hosts to this mineralization/alteration are ca. 1030 Ma, Grenvillian A-type anorogenic granitoids, ca. 615 Ma continental tholeiitic dykes and inclined sheets of the Long Range dyke swarm and calc-alkaline lamprophyric dykes of unknown affiliation. ⁴⁰Ar-³⁹Ar thermochronology on late-syn-kinematic biotite porphyroblasts constrains the age of the last peak (ca. 250 ° C) metamorphism to the latest Silurian at ca. 419 Ma. Hydrothermal sericite from the alteration assemblage yields plateau and pseudoplateau ages ranging from 409 ± 12 Ma to 377 ± 1. 5 Ma. Fluid inclusion assemblages have homogenization temperatures that range from 240 - 320 °C and are low salinity. Sulfur isotope results indicate that δ³⁴S values are heavier than sulfur from magmatic origins and Pb model ages suggest that Pb was scavenged from multiple sources. These observations collectively suggest that the Viking gold mineralization represents a unique silver-bearing, granite-hosted, orogenic gold deposit in the Humber Zone formed in the Lower Devonian after orogenic collapse, from auriferous fluids fluxed along the Doucer's Valley fault system...|$|E
40|$|On {{the island}} of Newfoundland a number of mafic- to ultramafic {{intrusions}} are exposed; most commonly in the Dunnage Zone. These intrusive suites occur {{in a variety of}} tectonic environments, and have variable relationships with their host rocks. Nickel is extracted from intrusive rocks of similar compositions throughout the world. This thesis evaluates the potential of three intrusive complexes in Newfoundland to host economic Ni-Cu sulphide and/or platinum group element (PGE) mineralization. [...] The Red Cross Lake Intrusive Suite (RCLIS), located in central Newfoundland, is a ca. 431 Ma layered, mafic- to ultramafic intrusion. The Steel Mountain Anorthosite (SMA), located east of Stephenville, in the Southern Long Range Mountains, is a ca. 1275 Ma massive-type anorthosite that hosts abundant Fe-Ti oxides and variable mafic zones. The Taylor Brook Gabbro Suite (TBGS), located southeast of western White Bay, is a ca. 430 Ma gabbroic suite. [...] The RCLIS is divided into an Upper and Lower Series (US and LS respectively). The LS is comprised of predominantly gabbro and troctolite layers with minor dunite, olivine gabbro and serpentinite. The US had a gabbroic- to leucogabbroic protolith that is variably altered to pyroxene amphibole gabbro. Geochemical data indicate the RCLIS exhibits an intermediate to alkaline and sub-alkaline composition and is tholeiitic. The RCLIS evolved through fractional crystallization; it exhibits a progressive decrease in MgO and an increase in FeO+Ti 0 ₂ from the LS to the US. Sulfides comprise at most only a few weight percent; the maximum values are from country rock samples. Magmatic sulfides in the LS locally exhibit a high Ni tenor. Plagioclase composition averages An 69 in the LS and An 54 in the US, whereas paragneiss xenolith samples average An 47. Olivine composition averages Fo 83 in the LS and Fo 56 for the US; xenoliths average Fo 36. LS olivine is locally Ni-depleted with respect to its Fo content. δ³⁴S ratios exhibit a range of 5. 64 ‰, from - 1. 79 ‰ to + 3. 85 ‰. The heaviest ratio is from a country rock sample, whereas igneous samples are closer to 0. 00 ‰, suggesting little country rock contamination. [...] The portion of the Steel Mountain Anorthosite (SMA) mapped is predominantly underlain by elongate, diffuse lenses of leuconorite, leucogabbro, norite and norite hosted by massive, recrystallized pink- to lilac coloured anorthosite. Massive Fe-Ti oxides occur locally in noritic units. Gabbroic units are relatively more altered, whereas noritic units more commonly preserve primary textures. Fe-Ti oxides exhibit complex exsolution textures. <b>Lithogeochemistry</b> was effective in separating the majority of samples along an evolutionary trend from Mg-rich melanorites to evolved anorthositic samples. Plagioclase becomes increasingly An-enriched as the rocks become more mafic. Clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene are consistently Mg-rich throughout the SMA. Locally, oxides display strong solid substitution and exsolution textures, which generally result from hematite exsolution in ilmenite or ulvöspinel exsolution in magnetite. In the Bishops quarries, hercynite is also common in magnetite. At Sheep Brook, pyrite contains up to 4. 7 wt. % Ni in concentric bands. Sperrylite and several other unnamed Pt-Te and Pd-Sb phases were identified. δ³⁴S ratios range from + 7. 33 %o to - 2. 41 ‰; the sulfides from Sheep Brook are near 1. 00 ‰ whereas sulfides in the Bishop quarries massive oxides are negative at - 2. 41 ‰. [...] The Taylor Brook Gabbro Suite (TBGS) is heterogeneous at all scales. It comprises a concentrically layered pyroxene amphibole gabbro intrusion that is cut by multiple sets of mafic and felsic dikes. In the northern region of the intrusion a separate, more mafic and coarse-grained zone is recognized. Much of the TBGS has been altered to greenschist assemblages with variable degrees of recrystallization. TBGS samples display well-developed geochemical evolution and are locally Fe-Ti enriched. The TBGS exhibits a sub-alkaline composition and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> suggests that it was emplaced in a within-plate tectono-magmatic environment. δ³⁴S ratios range from + 2. 22 ‰ to + 4. 81 ‰, suggesting a magmatic isotopic reservoir. [...] The RCLIS has the greatest Ni-Cu-PGE exploration potential {{because of the presence of}} olivine-rich ultramafic rocks, evidence for some country rock contamination, locally Ni-depleted olivine and high-Ni tenor sulfides cropping out in mafic and ultramafic rocks. The SMA has the potential for future discoveries of PGE mineralization in the Sheep Brook area; grassroots exploration based on structural analyses and geological mapping would be most effective at finding similar mineralization in the area. The TBGS has marginal exploration future, primarily because there are few rock types with characteristics to host orthomagmatic sulfide bodies. It is possible that the TBGS is only weakly eroded and that favourable stratigraphic horizons lie at depth...|$|E
40|$|The Cambrian Tally Pond {{volcanic}} belt {{in central}} Newfoundland contains numerous volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits, prospects, and showings that are locally associated with metalliferous mudstones and/or graphitic shales. Deposits in the belt are bimodal felsic-type VMS {{that are both}} base metal- (e. g., Duck Pond, Boundary) and precious metal-enriched (e. g., Lemarchant). At the Lemarchant deposit metalliferous mudstones are genetically and spatially associated with mineralization, whereas the relationship of other mudstones and shales to massive sulphide mineralization is more intricate and remains not fully understood. Metalliferous mudstones represent a hiatus in the volcanic activity where the deposition of hydrothermal products dominated over the abiogenic background sedimentation and/or dilution by volcaniclastic-epiclastic material. Lithogeochemical signatures allow one to distinguish between predominantly hydrothermally or detritally (i. e., non-hydrothermal) derived material. Metalliferous mudstones with a significant hydrothermal component, like those at Lemarchant, have elevated Fe/Al and base-metal contents, compared to detrital shales, and shale-normalized negative Ce and positive Eu anomalies, indicative of deposition from high temperature (> 250 °C) hydrothermal fluids within an oxygenated water column. Mudstones and shales sampled from other locations in the Tally Pond volcanic belt have more variable signatures ranging from hydrothermal (signatures as above) to non-hydrothermal (no positive Eu-anomalies, flat REE patterns), with some that have mixed (hydrothermal and detrital) signatures. Both S and Pb isotopic compositions indicate that proximal sulphides hosted in mudstones immediately associated with massive sulphide mineralization within the Lemarchant deposit contain {{a higher proportion of}} sulphur derived from hydrothermal sources and processes, and have more juvenile lead contributions, when compared to sulphides distal (not associated with massive sulphides) from mineralization. Lead and Nd isotopic compositions of both whole rock and minerals in the Lemarchant mudstones indicate involvement of underlying crustal basement during massive sulphide formation and throughout the evolution of the Tally Pond belt. Metalliferous mudstones precipitated early in the massive sulphide depositional history, but also have undergone syn- and post-ore-forming processes and have a larger lateral extent than the mineralization. Using <b>lithogeochemistry,</b> whole rock and in situ stable and radiogenic isotopes it is possible to distinguish prospective vent proximal (immediately associated with massive sulphide mineralization) from less prospective distal (not associated with massive sulphides) depositional environments and to reconstruct the paleotectonic setting on a deposit- to regional-scale for the Lemarchant deposit and other mudstone-associated prospects in the Tally Pond volcanic belt...|$|E
40|$|The Kangasjärvi Zn-Cu deposit is {{a highly}} {{deformed}} and metamorphosed Paleoproterozoic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit located in the Vihanti-Pyhäsalmi base metal mining district of central Finland. The host sequence to the deposit, {{referred to as the}} Inner Volcanic Sequence (IVS), is comprised of a bimodal suite of metavolcanic rocks and a regionally extensive tonalite-trondhjemite gneiss (sub-volcanic intrusions?). A separate and perhaps younger sequence of mafi c volcanic rocks, with irregular intervals of undifferentiated intermediate to felsic schists and metalimestones, referred to as the Outer Volcanic Sequence (OVS), are separated from the IVS sequence by intervals of metagreywacke and U-P-bearing graphitic schists. A stratigraphic scheme for rocks within the IVS is proposed based on outcrop observations, locally preserved volcanic textures, aspects of seafl oor-related hydrothermal alteration and <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> In this scheme, rare andesites form the lowermost volcanic stratigraphy and are overlain by typical island-arc basalts that were erupted in a subaqueous setting. Tonalite-trondhjemite subvolcanic intrusions were locally emplaced within andesites and coeval rhyolites were extruded on the basaltic substrate. The extrusion of rhyolites, including high-silica rhyolites, was coeval with regional-scale, pre-metamorphic seafloor hydrothermal alteration and local sulphide mineralization. Extensively altered rhyolites envelope massive sulphides and are underlain by altered basalts. The latter rocks are now characterized by a variety of low-variance metamorphic mineral assemblages (e. g. orthoamphibole-cordierite rocks) and define a domain of intense pre-metamorphic chlorite ± sericite alteration in the stratigraphic footwall of the deposit. The altered nature of these rocks is attributed to reaction with seawater-related hydrothermal fluids within a zone of upflow at or near the seafloor. The fundamental controls on convective hydrothermal circulation and subsequent alteration and massive sulphide mineralization at Kangasjärvi, and possibly elsewhere in the district, share many characteristics with other well-described, ancient VMS deposits (e. g. massive sulphide deposits in the Flin Flon Belt, Manitoba, Canada). These characteristics include: 1) an association with bimodal volcanism developed in extensional settings; 2) a close spatial association with regionally extensive felsic subvolcanic intrusions; and 3) petrogenesis of ore-associated volcanic rocks (e. g. high-silica rhyolites, felsic subvolcanic intrusions) indicative of substantial heat transfer from the mantle to the upper crust and the development of anomalous thermal corridors. These features translate into geochemically distinctive rock types that, when combined with aspects of stratigraphy and pre-metamorphic alteration, may be used to develop regional exploration strategies in the Vihanti-Pyhäsalmi district...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} from {{petrographic}} and lithogeochemical {{studies of the}} Late Precambrian terrigenous rocks (sandstones, gravelites, and aleuritic sandstones) from the Oselkovaya series of Prisayanie. The studies were conducted to reconstruct the primary composition of the rocks in the source area. It {{has been found that}} the rocks in {{the lower part of the}} cross-section of this series (Marninskaya suite, and the lower part of the Udinskaya suites) are represented by more coarse-grained terrigenous rocks (gravelites, and sandstones) as compared to the upper part of the cross-section (the upper part of the Udinskaya suite, and the Aisinskaya suite) with sandstones and aleuritic sandstones. Gravelites and sandstones from the lower part of the Oselkovaya series show indicators of epigenetic changes that are less intensively expressed in the rocks from the upper part of the cross-section. The upper and lower parts of the Oselkovaya series are significantly different in terms of <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> The lower rocks show quite low contents of Na 2 O and ratios K 2 O/Na 2 O ranging between 10 and 75. In the terrigenous sediments of the upper part, values of K 2 O/Na 2 O do not exceed 1 – 2. Sandstones and gravelites in the lower part of the Oselkovaya series are characterized by reduced concentrations of radioactive, rare-earth, and highly charged elements, as well as lower concentrations of Ni and Co relative to concentrations of these elements in sandstones and aleuritic sandstones of the Oselkovaya series. The petrographic and lithogeochemical characteristics of the terrigenous sediments of the lower and upper parts of the Oselkovaya series suggest different sources of the denudation of these rocks into the sedimentation basin. It is suggested that acid rocks were the denudation source of the terrigenous rocks in the lower part of the series, and the sandstones and aleuritic sandstones in the upper part of the series were sourced from rocks of a mixed (acid–base) composition. The composition of the rocks in the source area was reconstructed, and the published ages of detrital zircons from the sandstones of the upper and lower parts of the Oselkovaya series were taken into account. The reconstruction suggests that the lower part of the Oselkovaya series resulted from the destruction of the basement rocks in the Siberian craton. The upper part of the Oselkovaya series seems to have formed in the basin, wherein the denudation took place from the orogen formed as a result of the accretion of micro-continents and island arcs of the Paleo-Asian Ocean to the south-western margin of the Siberian craton. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this project}} a quartz-andalusite-sericite {{alteration}} zone in close vicinity to the Udden massive sulphide deposit in the Skellefte District in northern Sweden was studied. The {{objective was to}} find any correlation between the geological, mineralogical and geochemical character of the alteration zone and the associated Au-Te-Bi mineralization. The Udden area is situated in the Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks of the Skellefte Group in {{the central part of}} the Skellefte district. Most of the rocks in the Udden area are interpreted to be volcaniclastic, overlaid by a thick package of basinal sediments. The composition of the volcaniclastic rocks ranges from rhyolitic to mafic. The area has been subjected to several deformation events and regional metamorphism of upper greenschist facies. This, together with local deformation, has created a complex structural environment. A laterally extensive alteration zone is situated about 600 m south of the Udden open pit. It is characterized by strong leaching of most major elements, leaving a residue of mainly SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. The mineral assemblage of the alteration zone mainly consists of quartz, andalusite and sericite with locally occurring biotite, chlorite, topaz, fluorite and minor rutile. Just above the alteration zone occurs a layer of strongly foliated quartz and sericite. The highest concentrations of Au, Te and Bi seem to be spatially related to this layer, although the concentrations of these metals are generally elevated in the whole alteration zone, sometimes together with Hg and Sb. In close vicinity of the Udden area the Kedträsk and Åsen massive sulphide deposits can be found. They are both related to similar types of alteration as occur in the alteration zone in Udden. In other parts of the Skellefte district similar types of alteration are known to occur as well, often related to mineral deposits. For example in the gold-rich Boliden massive sulfide deposit, in Mångfallberget telluride mineralization not far from Boliden, and in Kristineberg massive sulphide deposit. To obtain the aims of this study the rocks have been logged in diamond drill cores and the minerals and their textures have been studied by thin section microscopy. The lithogeochemical analyze data was interpreted by immobile element plots to classify the rock types and mass-balance calculations and studies of the AAAI and ACNK alteration indexes to quantify the alteration intensity. These results have then been compared to similar types of deposits in the world that have been studied more extensively. The mineralogy, <b>lithogeochemistry</b> and overall shape of the alteration zone suggests that the alteration zone in Udden was formed as a steam-heated blanket in an epithermal environment.

40|$|The Aguablanca Ni–(Cu) sulfide deposit is {{hosted by}} a breccia pipe within a gabbro–diorite pluton. The deposit {{probably}} formed {{due to the}} disruption of a partially crystallized layered mafic complex at about 12 – 19 km depth and the subsequent emplacement of melts and breccias at shallow levels (< 2 km). The ore-hosting breccias are interpreted as fragments of an ultramafic cumulate, which were transported to the near surface along with a molten sulfide melt. Phlogopite Ar–Ar ages are 341 – 332 Ma in the breccia pipe, and 338 – 334 Ma in the layered mafic complex, and are similar to recently reported U–Pb ages of the host Aguablanca Stock and other nearby calcalkaline metaluminous intrusions (ca. 350 – 330 Ma). Ore deposition resulted from the combination of two critical factors, the emplacement of a layered mafic complex deep in the continental crust {{and the development of}} small dilational structures along transcrustal strike-slip faults that triggered the forceful intrusion of magmas to shallow levels. The emplacement of basaltic magmas in the lower middle crust was accompanied by major interaction with the host rocks, immiscibility of a sulfide melt, and the formation of a magma chamber with ultramafic cumulates and sulfide melt at the bottom and a vertically zoned mafic to intermediate magmas above. Dismembered bodies of mafic/ultramafic rocks thought to be parts of the complex crop out about 50 km southwest of the deposit in a tectonically uplifted block (Cortegana Igneous Complex, Aracena Massif). Reactivation of Variscan structures that merged at the depth of the mafic complex led to sequential extraction of melts, cumulates, and sulfide magma. <b>Lithogeochemistry</b> and Sr and Nd isotope data of the Aguablanca Stock reflect the mixing from two distinct reservoirs, i. e., an evolved siliciclastic middle-upper continental crust and a primitive tholeiitic melt. Crustal contamination in the deep magma chamber was so intense that orthopyroxene replaced olivine as the main mineral phase controlling the early fractional crystallization of the melt. Geochemical evidence includes enrichment in SiO 2 and incompatible elements, and Sr and Nd isotope compositions (87 Sr/ 86 Sri 0. 708 – 0. 710; 143 Nd/ 144 Ndi 0. 512 – 0. 513). However, rocks of the Cortegana Igneous Complex have low initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and high initial 143 Nd/ 144 Nd values suggesting contamination by lower crustal rocks. Comparison of the geochemical and geological features of igneous rocks in the Aguablanca deposit and the Cortegana Igneous Complex indicates that, although probably part of the same magmatic system, they are rather different and the rocks of the Cortegana Igneous Complex were not the direct source of the Aguablanca deposit. Crust–magma interaction was a complex process, and the generation of orebodies was controlled by local but highly variable factors. The model for the formation of the Aguablanca deposit presented in this study implies that dense sulfide melts can effectively travel long distances through the continental crust and that dilational zones within compressional belts can effectively focus such melt transport into shallow environments...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of alteration mineralogy, mineral chemistry, and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> in the host rocks surrounding the A-B and K lenses {{at the north end}} of the Rosebery mine has revealed a series of overlapping alteration halos with characteristic mineralogy and geochemistry. The study involved logging and sampling from nine drill holes spaced at varying distances from the A-B and K lenses. The stratiform Zn-Pb-Cu ore lenses have a sheetlike morphology and are hosted by a mixed sequence of rhyolitic to dacitic massive mediumgrained quartz-porphyritic pumice breccia, black mudstone, and crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone, overlying a thick homogeneous sequence of rhyolitic pumice breccia. The major alteration minerals at Rosebery are arranged in a complex series of zones passing away from the deposit-quartz-sericite zone, Mn carbonate zone, chlorite zone, and outer sericite zone. The chlorite zone is best developed in the immediate footwall below the copper-pyrite-rich ore lenses, whereas the strongest Mn carbonate alteration occurs in the immediate hanging-wall volcanics or lateral to the ore lenses. The outermost visible sericitic alteration extends about 60 to 100 m into the footwall, 10 to 20 m into the hanging wall, and over 500 m along the upper contact of the footwall pumice breccias. Thallium and antimony form the most extensive trace element halos related to the mineralization. Thallium forms a halo that extends 200 to 300 m into the overlying volcanics and 60 to 100 m into the footwall. Anomalously high thallium also occurs over 500 m along strike marking the contact between the footwall pumice breccias and the overlying volcaniclastic sandstones. Proximal to the ore lenses Tl and Sb values range from 10 to 100 ppm, compared to the halo zone where they vary from around 1 to 10 ppm. Studies of alteration mineral chemistry at Rosebery have revealed some important relationships that may assist exploration. The Mn content of alteration carbonate increases toward ore, both along strike and across strike. Close to ore, alteration carbonates contain > 20 mole percent MnCO 3 (kutnahorite, rhodochrosite, Mn siderite, and Mn ankerite), whereas at distances of 40 to 60 m across strike the mole percent MnCO 3 in carbonate drops to below 10 percent. At greater than 80 m, the carbonates are Mn-poor calcites and are commonly located in synmetamorphic structures. White mica composition changes with stratigraphy and alteration assemblages and may be related to the mineralizing event, although this has not been convincingly demonstrated. Proximal white mica contains minor Ba substituting for octahedral Al. However, except for their Ba content, these phengetic white micas are similar to those found in nonmineralized areas of the Mount Read Volcanics. Sodic white mica with up to 0. 35 Na/(Na + K) and a low phengite content (< 0. 5 Fe + Mg cations) occurs in a zone of volcanic sandstones and black slates overlying the ore deposit. This research has lead to the development of a series of proximal, medial, and distal vectors useful for both regional and mine-scale exploration. The most useful vectors, listed from proximal to distal, include Zn, Ba content of white mica, Na 2 O, K 2 O, Ishikawa alteration index (AI), S/Na 2 O, Ba/Sr, Mn content of carbonate, Tl, and Sb...|$|E
40|$|Exploration {{companies}} commonly rely on geochemistry {{to identify}} alteration of distinctive geochemical and mineralogical character, surrounding metal sulphide deposits that were precipitated from hydrothermal fluids. However, examination of raw analytical data {{is prone to}} error due to closure effects and the difficulty in removing the effects of background variation in unaltered rocks from the variations imposed by later hydrothermal alteration. Closure can be avoided by using ratios, or by utilising mass balance approaches based on fixing volume, mass or concentration changes between samples of parent and daughter lithologies. Using a parent-daughter approach is limiting, because only pairs of samples can be compared {{at any one time}} and because an unaltered equivalent must be produced for each sample examined in this way. Pearce Element Ratio analysis and General Element Ratio analysis (PER and GER) are not restricted in this fashion, and are more amenable to interrogation of large data sets. PER and GER are also capable of decoupling background variation from that variation due to hydrothermal alteration. Furthermore, these ratio methods are readily applied to commercially derived lithogeochemical assays. In this study, various analytical methods and interpretive techniques (including PER and GER) have been applied to identify alteration in rocks around the Century and Elura Zn-Pb-Ag deposits, and to assess whether primary ore-related alteration effects can still be identified once altered rocks have been subjected to weathering. Ratios of trace elements over a conserved element have been used to generate a suite of pathfinder elements for each deposit. Elements enriched in host rocks around both deposits include the economic metals Zn, Pb and Ag, along with Rb and Tl. Sodium is ubiquitously depleted in altered rocks. Other elements in the pathfinder suites are distinctive to each deposit type, and include a number of major and trace elements that are added or removed from the rocks around the mineralised zones. For example, Sb and As are enriched in rocks around Elura mineralisation while Ge and Cd are enriched in samples around Century deposit. Iron carbonate development accompanied by potassic alteration, the destruction of albite and the absence of chlorite are the dominant mineral alteration effects at both deposits. PER and GER diagrams have been used to quantify the intensity of this alteration and allow <b>lithogeochemistry</b> to be used to vector towards high intensity alteration, which is adjacent to Century and Elura mineralisation. These ratio methods are applied to both visibly and cryptically altered rocks at both deposits, and have a very high degree of success in classifying alteration in unweathered rocks. The following simple PER ratios indicate proximity to Elura mineralisation: Ca/C, K/Al for shales, K/(Al-Na) for siltstones/sandstones. The following simple PER ratios indicate proximity to Century mineralisation: Mn/Ti, Mg/Ti and Fe/Ti vs C/Ti, K/Ti vs Al/Ti, K/Ti vs (Al-Na) /Ti. Pathfinder elements can be overlain onto PER and GER diagrams to aid in ranking the prospectivity of samples, and to assess mineral hosts for individual pathfinder elements. Weathering destroys most indicators of alteration in the Elura area, while alteration signatures are better preserved in host rocks around the Century deposit...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, Boliden Mineral AB {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a new mineral deposit in the Laver-area, c. 40 km west of Älvsbyn, Norrbotten, Sweden. The deposit was classified as large volume, low grade Cu-Au-Mo mineralization. This discovery resulted from intense exploration activities in an area c. 1 km south of the historic Laver mine. Geological descriptions in the area are old and restricted to the old Laver mine, which differs in the style of mineralization. For this reason, two M. Sc projects were initiated as collaboration between Boliden Mineral AB, Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg (TUBAF) and Luleå University of Technology (LTU). This report summarizes the results of the LTU M. Sc project, which focused on petrography, alteration and vein types, and the relationship between these features and the mineralization. Three profiles have been studied, through drill core logging with emphasis on rock types, veins and alteration types. In addition, 43 polished thin sections were carefully examined with optical microscope, combined with further examination in SEM and electron microprobe. Furthermore, 15 <b>lithogeochemistry</b> samples, mainly from porphyritic intrusions, have been studied. The Laver deposits are located in the south-west part of the Karelian craton, in the Arvidsjaur-group volcanic rocks, interpreted as deposited in an active continental margin or continental arc. The wall rock in the study area consists of volcanic-sedimentary, mainly felsic rocks, interpreted as post-eruptive mass flow deposit. The intrusive rocks consist of plagioclase-quartz to plagioclase-hornblende-porphyritic intrusions of intermediate to felsic composition. Both wall rock and intrusions have a calc-alkaline affinity. No temporal or spatial correlation of mineralization to specific intrusions has been identified, yet non-porphyritic mafic dykes cut all other rock types including mineralization. Mineralization at Laver is vein- and alteration-related, not bound to specific rock types and most likely related to hydrothermal activity, caused by the intrusion of the porphyritic intrusions. Chalcopyrite is strongly correlated with epidote, and, to a lesser degree, with biotite in veins and in the alteration zones. Molybdenite is observed in quartz-veins and, to a lesser degree, in the groundmass, commonly associated with chlorite. Most veins in the study area carry at least minor sulphides. Mineralized veins cut and displace barren veins, but are themselves cut by barren veins, often with clear displacements along the vein contacts. Furthermore, chalcopyrite and pyrite have locally been tectonically remobilized into ‘ladder-vein´ structures on a small scale. These observations are consistent with a syn-tectonic timing of vein formation and mineralization. Alternatively, the observations could be interpreted as syn-tectonic sulphide remobilization during deformation of existing veins, or a combination of both. The style of the mineralized vein systems and associated alteration, the spatial affinity of mineralization to porphyritic intrusions, the low grade/high tonnage style of mineralization, as well as the indication of a syn-tectonic timing of mineralization at Laver is similar to porphyry systems worldwide. However, a major difference {{is the fact that the}} vein systems and alteration zones at Laver commonly contain a higher proportion of calcic minerals (e. g. epidote) than in typical porphyry systems. This may have resulted from telescoping at a late stage, whereby original potassic and sericitic alteration assemblages have been overprinted by propylitic assemblages.

40|$|The Mount Ayliff Complex (MAC) is {{situated}} {{on the border between}} Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape provinces in the Republic of South Africa, approximately 90 km due west of Port Shepstone. The Complex forms part of the Karoo Igneous Province and includes five lobes (Ingeli, Insizwa, Tonti, Tabankulu, and Horseshoe) that are the remnants of a single continuous intrusive sheet that had an original extent of 18, 000 km 2 • The current outcrop is estimated at 800 km 2 • The lobes all show extensive internal differentiation, from basal ultramafic cumulates to diorites and monzonites at the top, while most other intrusions in the Karoo Igneous Province cooled rapidly enough to produce relatively homogenous dolerites. Most work conducted on the Complex thus far has centered on the Insizwa lobe due to the presence of a Ni-sulphide occurrence near the base of the lobe at Waterfall Gorge. The setting of the ores has analogies to the Noril'sk-Talnakh deposits, which has raised considerable exploration interest on the Mount Ayliff Complex over the last century. The current study investigates the Ni-Cu sulphide potential of the Ingeli and Horseshoe lobes, which have been poorly studied in the past. To this effect, a stream sediment survey was conducted around the Ingeli lobe to try and detect potentially hidden magmatic sulphide ores. Further, the five lobes of the Complex have been compared in terms of lithology and <b>lithogeochemistry.</b> Analytical techniques used for the current study include: XRF, ICP-MS and electron microprobe. Stream sediment samples were analysed using XRF and ICP-OES. Olivines from the ultramafic cumulates of the Ingeli and Insizwa lobes are undepleted in Ni, whereas olivines from the Horseshoe and Tabankulu lobes are strongly depleted in Ni. This suggests that the rocks of the latter two lobes crystallized from parental magmas that interacted with a sulphide liquid and that the magmatic flow direction was from the north to the south. The data indicate that the ultramafic rocks of the Complex plot on or near control lines between olivine and Karoo dolerite indicating that the rocks are mixtures of cumulus olivine and trapped melt of Karoo dolerite composition. There appears to be a copper enrichment towards the top of the ultramafic package in the Ingeli lobe. This pattern corresponds to other studies conducted in the InsiZWa lobe and suggests that the two lobes had originally been connected. The lowermost cumulates of the Ingeli lobe contain an enhanced crustal component suggesting some in situ contamination. No significant sulphide enrichments were encountered in the Basal Zone rocks of the Ingeli lobe. However, the stream sediment data indicate localized PGE enrichment indicating the possible presence of a localized hidden sulphide occurrence of the type found at Waterfall Gorge. Small amounts of sulphides were found associated with the Basal Zone rocks in the Horseshoe lobe consistent with the trends of Ni-depletion of olivines. However, a lack of Co depletion in the ultramafic rocks of this lobe suggests that any sulphide segregation event that did take place was of a relatively small scale.

40|$|Mafic-to-felsic {{intrusive}} rocks of the Horse Cove Complex have been mapped {{in detail in}} the area surrounding Bauline {{on the east coast}} of Conception Bay in the Avalon Zone, Newfoundland. The Horse Cove Complex is characterized by a swarm of mafic-to- felsic dykes that coincide with the extrapolated trace of the Topsail Fault along the east coast of Conception Bay and are hosted by mafic submarine volcanic rocks and, locally, by diorite. In the Bauline area, the Horse Cove Complex is hosted by granodiorite, which has been dated at 625 ± 1. 5 Ma using U/Pb zircon geochronology with the chemical abrasion thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) method. This granodiorite is correlative to the felsic plutonic rocks of the Holyrood and White Hills intrusive suites, located south of Bauline, within and along the eastern margin of the Holyrood Horst. Based on detailed mapping and petrography in the Bauline area, the Horse Cove Complex has been divided into ten rock units. These rocks units include: feldspar porphyry, gabbro and diorite, which are the host rocks to the dyke swarm, and eight rock units that represent dykes of mafic-to-felsic composition. The Horse Cove Complex has been affected by greenschist-facies metamorphism, resulting in partial replacement of igneous mineral assemblages by greenschist-facies minerals, but igneous minerals and textures are still recognizable. The age of magmatism in the Horse Cove Complex has been bracketed by CA-TIMS U/Pb zircon ages of feldspar porphyry (580. 6 ± 2. 0 Ma) and an andesitic dyke (578. 4 ± 2. 3 Ma). Since field relationships indicate that these rock units represent the oldest and youngest datable rocks in the Complex, magmatism occurred over a period of 6. 5 Ma or less: from 582. 6 to 576. 1 Ma, at maximum age limits. This age of magmatism overlaps, within uncertainties, with several magmatic events on the NE A val on Peninsula, including felsic volcanic and fine-grained {{intrusive rocks}} along the eastern margin of the Holyrood Horst and near Cape St. Francis. Based on <b>lithogeochemistry,</b> feldspar porphyry and rhyolitic dykes in the Horse Cove Complex appear to represent volcanic arc magmatism and may be co-magmatic. The mafic to intermediate dykes and host rocks in the Horse Cove Complex are comprised of calc-alkaline and tholeiitic rocks that exhibit a range of compositions, from rocks with EM ORB-like geochemistry to rocks that are LREE-enriched and have negative Nb anomalies, con 1 parable to subduction-related calc-alkaline basalts and andesites. There is an overall progression from rocks with E-MORB-like geochemistry to rocks with arc signatures, but exceptions exist due to the episodic emplacement and complex crosscutting relationships of the dyke swarm. Seven rocks from the Horse Cove Complex, including a rhyolitic dyke and several mafic-to-intermediate rocks, have εNd values (at 580 Ma) ranging from + 4. 1 to + 6. 4. Thus, these rocks appear to have depleted mantle sources that have undergone various degrees of mixing or assimilation with older, LREEenriched sources, such as continental crust and/or sediments in a subduction zone. The interpreted paleo-tectonic setting of the Horse Cove Complex is a back-arc basin environment, in which rocks with LREE-enriched mantle sources and subductioncontaminated sources were emplaced side-by-side and closely in time. The Horse Cove Complex may represent the last phase of subduction-related magmatism in the eastern Avalon Zone in Newfoundland prior to deep marine, deltaic and alluvial fan sedimentation during the late Neoproterozoic...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARIES <b>Lithogeo{{chemistry}}</b> RF Berry, D Selley and MJ White The whole rock {{chemistry of}} the sedimentary rocks of the Mt Read Volcanics {{were compared to}} see if they were useful in distinguishing sedimentary sources sufficiently well to support a basin analysis. The chemical data was also investigated to demonstrate whether it could be used to solve some difficult lithostratographic correlation problems. The trace element chemistry indicates that at least four sources can be readily discerned. These are a low Ti basalt (MUC and Hellyer basalt), an intermediate Ti basalt (from normal Crimson Creek Formation and a very high Ti basaltic suite (unknown source for Tyndall Group), and a felsic source. The separation of the felsic source into several groups may be possible with more Th data. The Precambrian basement source signature lies in the middle of these four types and cannot be detected unless it is a dominant component such as in the Stitt Quartzite. It is best detected by the presence of rounded zircon and tourmaline (and detrital mica). The preliminary investigation indicated whole rock chemistry may be very useful in distringuishing a range of different rock types. The Animal Creek greywacke and Farrell Slate are clearly distinct from Dundas Group. The EQPS has a lower Ti/V than CVC volcaniclastics. The Tyndall Group was separated by high Ti/Th. These relationships need more data for a proper assessment but they are very encouraging. Sedimentological evidence for Cambrian growth faults on {{the eastern side of the}} Dundas Trough, western Tasmania - Matt White Geological evidence in the Anthony River area suggests that Cambrian movement was apparent on what is referred to as the Selina fault, during upper Tyndall Group (Middle to Late Cambrian) time. This is consistent with observations of Keele (1991) and Berry & Keele (1993), who interpreted a normal fault on the contact of the Tyndall Group and the Eastern Quartz-phyric sequence in this area. A southern bounding possible transfer fault may have constrained Tyndall Group deposition into a small fault-bounded basin. Reverse movement on the fault involving east-block upward movement is another possibility. Progress Report 4 : Detecting Cambrian structures in the Mount Read Volcanic Belt using sulfur isotopes - sulfur isotopes of growth faults - Garry J. Davidson and Paul Kitto Sulfur isotope results from Cambrian growth faults can be tentatively divided according to fault style and fluid history. Those containing base-metal sulfides have values similar to known base-metal deposits in the Mount Read Volcanics (Carters Prospect). These consistently vary from north (d 34 S = 5 - 9 permil) to south (d 34 S = 7 - 15 permil) in the belt (Solomon et al., 1988). Those faults with small displacements, likely original Normal fault geometries, and pyrite rather than base-metal sulfides in the alteration assemblage, contain heavy sulfur (e. g. Comstock - Zig Zag Hill, d 34 S > approx 20 permil). Some of these have tentatively been identified at the margins of large base metal deposits, such as Rosebery. Thirdly, faults that lie sub-parallel to stratigraphy, are extensively sericite-chlorite altered, and are defined by wide shear zones (e. g. Moxons Saddle), have d 34 S = 0 ± 5 permil, and may represent deep rock-buffered fluid circulation, although this conclusion requires confirmation of a Cambrian origin, because these values overlap those expected from Devonian magmatism. These conclusions are very preliminary, and will require detailed work on each scenario in the coming field season.

40|$|What tectonic {{processes}} {{were operating}} in the Archean, and whether they were similar to the “modern-style” plate tectonics seen operating today, is a fundamental question about Archean geology. The Superior Province is the largest piece of preserved Archean crust on Earth. As such it provides an excellent opportunity to study Archean tectonic processes. Much work has been completed {{in the southern part}} of the Superior Province. A well-documented series of discrete, southward younging orogenies related to a series of northward dipping subduction zones, has been proposed for amalgamating this part of the Superior Province. The tectonic evolution in the northwestern Superior Province is much less constrained, and it is unclear if it is related to the series of subduction zones {{in the southern part of}} the Superior Province, or if it is related to an entirely different process. Such ideas need to be tested in order to develop a concise model for the Meso – and Neoarchean tectonic evolution of the northwestern Superior Province. To this end, a field mapping, U-Pb geochronology, Nd isotope, and <b>lithogeochemistry</b> study was undertaken in the Island Lake greenstone belt. This granite-greenstone belt is part of the northern margin of the North Caribou terrane, a larger reworked Mesoarchean crustal block located in the northwestern Superior Province. U-Pb TIMS zircon geochronology data shows that the Island Lake greenstone belt experienced a long and complex geological history that included the deposition of three distinct volcanic assemblages at ca. 2897 Ma, 2852 Ma, and 2744 Ma, as well as a younger clastic sedimentary group, the Island Lake group. All of these volcanic assemblages include felsic and mafic volcanic rocks, as well as a suite of contemporaneous plutonic rocks. The U-Pb data set shows that the Savage Island shear zone, a regional fault structure that transects the Island Lake greenstone belt, is not a terrane-bounding feature as correlative supracrustal assemblages are observed on both sides of it. The Nd isotope data shows that the volcanic assemblages and contemporaneous plutons have been variably contaminated by an older ca. 3. 0 Ga crustal source. The mafic volcanic rocks in the assemblages have two distinct geochemical signatures, and show a pattern of decreasing crustal contamination with decreasing age. Together these data suggests that the Meso – and Neoarchean volcanic assemblages are part of an intact primary volcanic stratigraphy that were built on the same ca. 3. 0 Ga basement and have autochthonous relationships with each other. This basement is the North Caribou terrane. The youngest sedimentary group in the belt, the Island Lake group, was deposited between 2712 Ma and 2699 Ma. It consists of “Timiskaming-type” sedimentary rocks, and is the youngest clastic sedimentary package in the belt. A detailed study of detrital zircons in units from the stratigraphic bottom to the top of the sedimentary group indicates an age pattern of detrital zircons that is most consistent with a scenario in which sediments were deposited in inter-diapiric basins created by diapirism and sagduction (i. e., vertical tectonic) processes. During the diapiric ascent of the felsic material, inter-diapiric basins were formed in the synclines between adjacent domes, into which sediments were deposited. U-Pb zircon TIMS geochronology identified two ages of deformation in the Island Lake greenstone belt. Two dykes that crosscut an older, D 1 foliation place a minimum age of ca. 2723 Ma on the D 1 deformation, and two syn-kinematic dykes date movement along two transpressional shear zones to 2700 Ma. Together all these data indicate that the tectonic evolution in the Island Lake greenstone belt and in the northwestern Superior Province took place in three main stages. The first two stages involved the generation of Meso – and Neoarchean volcanic assemblages and contemporaneous plutonic rocks due to southward dipping subduction under the North Caribou micro-continent. The third stage involved the deposition of late “Timiskaming-type” sediments during vertical tectonic processes in conjunction with horizontal tectonic movement along late transpressional shear zones at ca. 2. 70 Ga. At the end of this process the North Superior superterrane was terminally docked to the North Caribou terrane along the North Kenyon fault. This study shows that while a version of horizontal or “modern” style plate tectonics were {{operating in the}} Archean, vertical tectonic processes were also occurring and that these processes operated synchronously in the Neoarchean...|$|E
