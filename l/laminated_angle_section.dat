An approach of transforming the open-angle section to a closed section is used with CFRP {{as a means to}} increase the flexural stiffness and strength. A total of 30 steel <b>angle</b> <b>sections,</b> both CFRP-reinforced and bare steel angle specimens, were tested in 4 -point bending. The slenderness ratio (b/t), different CFRP layers, and orientation of CFRP are the parameters included in this work.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> is simple, but the behaviour and design calculations of <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> {{can be quite}} complicated. Furthermore, lipped <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> with unequal flange widths form a non-symmetric section and the behaviour of the section is even more complicated than a singly-symmetric <b>angle</b> <b>section</b> with equal flange widths. A test program on cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns is presented. The non-symmetric <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> were brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets having nominal yield stresses of 450 and 550 MPa with plate thicknesses of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 1. 9  mm. The material properties of the column specimens were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The behaviour and strengths of cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns were investigated. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification {{for the design of}} cold-formed steel structural members. In addition, the current design rules in the North American Specification for cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns are assessed using reliability analysis.

40|$|Globally, {{there is}} need for {{strengthening}} of steel structures {{due to increased}} load carrying requirements, changes in earthquake / wind codes and rehabilitation due to corrosion degradation. Advanced composites have {{become one of the}} most popular techniques of repairing and/or strengthening civil infrastructure in the past couple of decades. The use of FRP material for the repair and rehabilitation of steel members has numerous benefits over the traditional methods of bolting or welding of steel plates. Carbon FRPs (CFRPs) have been preferred over other FRP material for strengthening of steel structures due to CFRPs possess higher stiffness. The emergence of high modulus CFRP, with an elastic modulus higher than that of steel, enables researchers to achieve substantial load transfer in steel beams before the steel yields. In the present work, experimental investigation is carried out to analyze the behavior of steel <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> wrapped with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) to increase flexural strength and stiffness of parent structural member steel <b>angle</b> <b>section</b> due to CFRP wrapping. A total of 4 tensile coupon tests are conducted to determine the engineering properties of structural steel used. A novel flexural strengthening technique using bonded CFRP wrapping to enhance the strength and stiffness of existing steel <b>angle</b> <b>sections</b> has been developed. This is carried out by varying the CFRP wrap configurations and keeping adhesive properties constant. The experimental program consists of two sets each with 15 specimens to test a total of 30 specimens. Each set has five subsets as four different strengthening configurations and a set representing reference control specimens. The parameters studied include the slenderness ratio (b/t) of steel angles, the thickness and orientation of the CFRP wrap, comparative study on behavior of strengthened specimens, investigation on stiffness enhancement and strain variation across the section in relation with load. This research investigated experimentally the behavior transformation of open sections into closed section, stiffening enhancement in elastic region and strength enhancement in both elastic and post yield regions of high strength CFRP vi strengthened structural steel angles tested under four point bending system in comparison with bare steel angles. Proposed external wrapping (bonded) CFRP reinforcement has been clearly established as a promising alternative to existing strengthening technique for steel structures. This proves that CFRP strengthening can be employed with proposed strengthening configuration to achieve desired degree of effectiveness and efficiency. The new strengthening approach has resulted in novel wrapping technology which has been first time applied to structural steel <b>angle</b> <b>section</b> (open section).

30|$|We {{explain in}} Section “Coupled atomistic and {{discrete}} dislocations in 3 D: core template” {{the importance of}} the core template boundary condition for CADD 3 D to successfully build the multiscale framework. In order to obtain this core template, we provide comprehensive modeling techniques to create a dislocation with arbitrary character <b>angles</b> (<b>Section</b> “Method 1 : Atomistic dislocation modeling”). We also provide an extended variational Peierls-Nabarro (PN) method [15] to validate the obtained MD core structures (Section “Method 2 : Variational Peierls-Nabarro method”). Interestingly, the extended PN method can be used to predict core structures of mixed dislocations which cannot be obtained with MD simulations due to limitation of computational cost. With the successful extension of PN method, we show favorable core structures when compared to MD, and analyze the details of dislocation core structures of all the studied character <b>angles</b> (<b>Section</b> “Results 1 : Comparison between the MD and PN models core structures”). We also measure Peierls stresses for various mixed dislocations (Section “Results 2 : Peierls stresses”), and show that Peierls stresses are largely influenced by the atomistic structures of the dislocation core.
