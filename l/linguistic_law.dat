In Catalonia, on the other hand, there is a high social and political consensus on the language policies favoring Catalan, also among Spanish speakers and speakers of other languages. The United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled in 1993 against similar policies in Quebec stating that [...] "A State may choose one or more official languages but it may not exclude outside the spheres of public life, the freedom to express oneself in a certain language". The US government, based on its Human Rights Report, questions the <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> and reports irregularities of the rights of the Spanish speakers in Catalonia. On the other hand, such organisations as Plataforma per la Llengua reported different violations of the linguistic rights of the Catalan speakers in Catalonia and the other Catalan-speaking territories in Spain, most of them caused by the institutions of the Spanish government in these territories.|$|E

Here we review and critically discuss how these laws can be statistically interpreted, fitted, and tested (falsified). The modern availability of large databases of written text allows for tests with an unprecedent statistical accuracy and also a characterization of the fluctuations around the typical behavior. We find that fluctuations are usually much larger than expected based on simplifying statistical assumptions (e. g., independence and lack of correlations between observations). These simplifications appear also in usual statistical tests so that the large fluctuations can be erroneously interpreted as a falsification of the law. Instead, here we argue that <b>linguistic</b> <b>laws</b> are only meaningful (falsifiable) if accompanied by a model for which the fluctuations can be computed (e. g., a generative model of the text). The large fluctuations we report show that the constraints imposed by <b>linguistic</b> <b>laws</b> on the creativity process of text generation are not as tight as one could expect.

50|$|Historians {{agree that}} the Walloon {{political}} movement began in 1880 with {{the foundation of a}} Walloon and French-speaking defence movement following the first <b>linguistic</b> <b>laws</b> of the 1870s. It took the character of a movement asserting the existence of Wallonia and a Walloon identity without giving up the defence of French. Wallonia asserted timidly since 1898 but which becomes the principal claim since 1905 with a climax at the Walloon congress of 1912 and Jules Destrée's Letter to the King. The First World War and a reviving of Belgian patriotism applied a brake to the movement and it spin offs. Walloon militants banded together in 1930s under the patronage of the Walloon Concentration where the radical ideas of 1912 were born again bringing into existence the <b>linguistic</b> <b>laws</b> of 1932. During the Second World War, several activists distinguished themselves within Resistance by forming various clandestine groupings. This world war radicalised even more the movement which for the first time speaks about independence ideas, and which will lead to its active participation in the Royal Question in 1950. Then follows a lull long of a decade which ends with the 1960-61 Winter General Strike with at its head André Renard who ally Walloon Movement claims and workers' claims.|$|R

A text has the following characteristics: (a) the variables, its transformed functions and parameters are the lexic units or LUN of ecological models; (b) the syllables are constituted by a LUN, or a chain of them, separated by operating or ordering LUNs; (c) the flow equations are words; and (d) the distribution of words (LUM and CLUN) according to their lengths is based on a Poisson distribution, the Chebanov's law. It is founded on Vakar's formula, that is calculated likewise the linguistic entropy for L(M). We will apply these ideas over practical examples using MARIOLA model.

However, this assembly, contrary to the Belgian and regional legislators and the Belgian and European judiciary, has no legal competency in these matters, only a moral one.

The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> that aims to increase the use of Catalan. According to the law, both Catalan and Spanish - being official languages - can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities even though the Generalitat usually uses only Catalan in its communications and notifications addressed to the general population. The citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so request. The various media belonging to Catalan government public broadcasting are monolingual in Catalan. However, except for a few hours in Catalan on La 2 and on some radio station, all the media belonging to the Spanish government are Spanish monolingual in Catalonia, as in the rest of Spain. The language policy favouring Catalan consistently implemented by the successive governments ruling the regional government of Catalonia since the 1980s has become increasingly contentious and controversial during the 2000s, especially in public education.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} of World War I and the reviving of Belgian patriotism brake the Walloon Movement that only began to affirm itself few years early, {{and are a}} source of division in the Movement. The Walloon Assembly, at that time the standard-bearer of wallingant revendications, adopt a Belgian nationalist position, position opposed to its prime goal. That involves tensions with the more radicals wallingants who then leave the Assembly and its satellites. These tensions arrive at the moment of <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> of 31 July 1921 which envisages the constitution of 3 linguistic Regions, two unilingual—one Dutch-speaking and a French-speaking—and one bilingual. Even if in the facts the bilingual communes and of the Dutch-speaking Area and the French-speaking Area become all French-speaking and that the bilingualism of Brussels was also regarded as a victory by the French-speaking people, this law is felt as a threat by the Walloon militants because it blames the experiment up to now unilingual of Wallonia: the law provides indeed that the other language can be used in each linguistic Region. Despite every amendments brought to the law at the Senate, only three walloon deputies on fifty-nine with the Room will vote for it: fifty and one vote against and six abstain from. Since 1920, the Assembly undergoes a large disaffection and loses its more famous names whereas create for themselves dissenting leagues a little everywhere. The Action Committee of the Walloon Assembly in Liege becomes a new Walloon League of Liège and affirms itself more and more since 1923 as the new leader of the movement. This league undertakes then to do a hard work of propaganda: from 1924 to 1930, it organizes seven annual congresses from which is born a new gathering of walloon associations, the Walloon Concentration.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{chromosome}} number tends to decrease as genome size increases in angiosperm plants. Here the relationship between number of parts (the chromosomes) {{and size of the}} whole (the genome) is studied for other groups of organisms from different kingdoms. Two major results are obtained. First, the finding of relationships of the kind "the more parts the smaller the whole" as in angiosperms, but also relationships of the kind "the more parts the larger the whole". Second, these dependencies are not linear in general. The implications of the dependencies between genome size and chromosome number are two-fold. First, they indicate that arguments against the relevance of the finding of negative correlations consistent with Menzerath-Altmann law (a <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> that relates the size of the parts with the size of the whole) in genomes are seriously flawed.

40|$|Identifying {{universal}} principles underpinning diverse {{natural systems}} {{is a key}} goal of the life sciences. A powerful approach in addressing this goal has been to test whether patterns consistent with linguistic laws are found in nonhuman animals. Menzerath's law is a <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> that states that, the larger the construct, the smaller {{the size of its}} constituents. Here, to our knowledge, we present the first evidence that Menzerath's law holds in the vocal communication of a nonhuman species. We show that, in vocal sequences of wild male geladas (Theropithecus gelada), construct size (sequence size in number of calls) is negatively correlated with constituent size (duration of calls). Call duration does not vary significantly with position in the sequence, but call sequence composition does change with sequence size and most call types are abbreviated in larger sequences. We also find that intercall intervals follow the same relationship with sequence size as do calls. Finally, we provide formal mathematical support for the idea that Menzerath's law reflects compression-the principle of minimizing the expected length of a code. Our findings suggest that a common principle underpins human and gelada vocal communication, highlighting the value of exploring the applicability of linguistic laws in vocal systems outside the realm of language.

40|$|Interpreting past {{language}} policies: An {{analysis of}} a <b>linguistic</b> <b>law</b> for the Belgian Congo of 1908 and its present-day effects When in 1908 the Belgian government took over the Congo from the Belgian King Leopold II, a charter was drafted that {{would serve as a}} constitution-like statutory code for the Belgian Congo. This ”Colonial Charter” contained one article, article 3, on language and linguistic rights in the colony. Its text is the expression of a complex microcosm of ideologies and political considerations that surrounded language, identity, community, and human rights {{at the time of its}} creation. Already hard to understand by laymen in its own time, the text certainly defies ready interpretation when read today in the absence of sufficient historical and contextual information. Presented is, first of all, a historical explanation of article 3, as well as an account of the backgrounds and contexts of its genesis. One of the findings here is that article 3 epitomized the duality of language questions with which the Belgian colonizers remained faced until Congolese independence in 1960, i. e. the tension between on the one hand the French-Dutch language question (relating to communication among the Belgian population), and, on the other, the indigenous language question (relating to vertical communication between colonizer and colonized). Secondly an account is also given of the intended or unintended effects which article 3 had throughout Belgian colonization until 1960, and which it still shows to have had on the linguistic landscape of the independent Congo until the present day. In this part, the analysis will zoom in on the official French monolingualism of the Congo, as well as on the ”weak” position of the four national lingua francas, all a consequence of early Belgian language-political decisions.
