5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E

5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals {{are superior to}} lead {{in some of these}} aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> phasing out for some uses.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> collapse.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> dissolution.|$|E
5|$|A port of Resident Evil 2 for the Sega Saturn was {{developed}} internally at Capcom for a time, but technical difficulties <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> cancellation in October 1998. Tiger Electronics released a sprite-based 2.5D version for their Game.com handheld in late 1998. It included only Leon's story path, and removed {{several of the}} original game's core features. In February 2013, an unfinished build of Resident Evil 1.5 was leaked onto the Internet.|$|E
5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E

5|$|Between 1954 and 1962, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a row of houses and the Prime Minister's chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, College Green, was laid out beside the tower, {{on top of an}} underground parking lot. The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and filled with water between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> being drained and lined with gravel.|$|E
5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent.

The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> protection.|$|E
5|$|Frank's father, Otto, {{the only}} {{survivor}} of the family, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved {{by one of the}} helpers, Miep Gies, and his efforts <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> publication in 1947.

5|$|In around 700 BC, the Phoenicians {{founded and}} {{fortified}} {{the city of}} Maleth {{on one of the}} highest points of the island, far away from the sea. Eventually the city was taken over by the Roman Empire and it was renamed Melite. The city was again renamed Medina by the Arabs which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> present name Mdina. Its fortifications were modified a number of times over time, and although most were dismantled and rebuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries, some foundations of the ancient Punic-Roman ramparts, as well as various medieval remains, were recently discovered during excavations.|$|E
