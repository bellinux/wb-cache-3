50|$|Well-fed {{adults do}} not often eat their own young, {{although}} sometimes safe zones {{are required for}} the fry. Specially designed livebearer birthing tanks, which can be suspended inside the aquarium, are available from aquatic retailers. These also serve to shield the pregnant female from further attention from the males, which is important because the males sometimes attack the females while they are giving birth. It also provides a separate area for the newborn young as protection from being eaten by their mother. However, if a female is put in the breeder box too early, it may cause her to have a miscarriage. Well-planted tanks that offer barriers to adult guppies shelter the young quite well. Guppy grass, water sprite, water wisteria, duckweed, and java moss are all good choices. A continuous supply of live food, such as Daphnia or brine shrimp, keep adult fish full and may spare the fry when they are born. Young fry take roughly {{three or four months}} to reach maturity. Feeding fry live foods, such as baby brine shrimp, microworms, infusoria and vinegar eels, is recommended.

To start, each team takes a helicopter ride, then will be dropped into the water, where they will have to swim to the shore to their first checkpoint, [...] "Kayak The Fjord." [...] Each team must kayak their way through the fjord, where they will change into their team uniforms, then sprint to the third checkpoint, [...] "Mind Games." [...] Each team has 30 minutes to unscramble a five-word sentence with a pile of rocks marked with letters. (The five-word sentence is [...] "You will respect the trolls.") The third checkpoint is [...] "Don't Flip Your Lid," [...] where each team has to flip a series of six cards with the Flag of Norway from the edge of a table into a series of six glasses filled with <b>liquid</b> <b>fish</b> eggs. Each team must consume one glass prior to flipping the cards. A team is required to consume a full glass for each time that they fail to flip a card into the glass after three attempts. (Note: Jay & Jenna were disqualified at this checkpoint, after Jay was unable to consume the liquid, leaving Jordan & Sarah and Leroy & Theresa as the only teams competing in the final.) Each team then sprints to the fourth checkpoint, [...] "Get Your Rocks Off," [...] in which teams have 30 minutes to grab five rocks from a rockpile, and then toss the rocks from a distance into a bucket. Prior to this checkpoint, each team is required to consume a tube of liquid caviar. If players from each team misses, they must sprint back and continue the process of collecting rocks from the rockpile until they toss a total of five rocks into the bucket. The fifth checkpoint is a bicycle ride to the Slogen trailhead. The sixth checkpoint is a [...] "Rest Stop," [...] where teams must take their place either within their designated zone next to a campfire, or on top of their beds. On day two, the final race is a grueling climb {{to the top of}} Slogen, in which the first-place team wins $250,000 and the second-place team wins $70,000.

Microencapsulated fish oil powder can improve tolerance and acceptance of LC n- 3 PUFAs. Bioavailability is important to achieve efficacy. We investigated the bioavailability of LC n- 3 PUFAs from microencapsulated powder in comparison with meals enriched with <b>liquid</b> <b>fish</b> oil. Participants (N= 99, age⩾ 50 years) of this 4 -week double-blinded dietary intervention were randomized into three groups. Group 1 (n= 38) received 1. 5 [*]g/d eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as ready-to-eat meals enriched with <b>liquid</b> <b>fish</b> oil; group 2 (n= 30) received the same amount of these LC n- 3 PUFAs as microencapsulated fish oil powder and regular meals; and group 3 (n= 31) was the control group, which received placebo powder and regular meals. Blood samples were taken from fingertips at baseline and at the end point. Seventy-seven subjects (77. 8 %) completed the study.

The published article is copyrighted by American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] (Rubus ssp. Rubus) cultivars, three trailing types (Marion, Black Diamond, and Obsidian) and one semierect type (Triple Crown), were studied for their response to different types of fertilizer from 2011 – 12, at a certified organic, grower collaborator site located in Jefferson, OR. Plants were fertilized at a target rate of 50 lb/acre nitrogen (N) each spring using three different sources: 1) a <b>liquid</b> <b>fish</b> and molasses blend (4 N– 0 P– 1. 7 K); 2) pelletized soy (Glycine max) meal (8 N– 0. 4 P– 1. 7 K); and 3) pelletized, processed poultry litter (4 N– 1. 3 P– 2. 5 K). Plants were drip irrigated, and weeds were managed using a polypropylene, permeable landscape fabric (weed mat). Plant responses were greatly affected by cultivar, whereas the effects of fertilizer type were relatively minor. ‘Triple Crown’ produced the greatest yield in both years, whereas ‘Black Diamond’ and ‘Marion’ had the lowest yield in 2011 and 2012, respectively. ‘Triple Crown’ fruit had the highest percent soluble solids and were the least firm in 2011, whereas ‘Marion’ fruit were the least firm in 2012. Harvest date, within year, affected the fruit quality variables measured in all cultivars. Most soil nutrient levels were within the recommended range for all fertilizer treatments, except for boron (B), which declined to deficient levels in the second year. Fertilizer type had no effect on soil nutrient levels other than fertilization with the fish and molasses blend product increased soil potassium and sodium. Soil nutrient levels were affected by cultivar but varied by year for many nutrients. Primocane leaf tissue nutrient concentrations were above or within recommended standards for most nutrients, except for magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and B, which, depending on the cultivar, were below standards. Over the 2 -year study, the blackberry cultivars responded similarly to the three types of organic fertilizer.

Furthermore, the lack of any detriment to fish growth in diets containing BPC suggests there are no significant issues regarding any negative effects of potential antinutritional factors which can otherwise be the case with other plant origin products.

The objective of this two year study was to evaluate the target and non-target effects of an organic disease management system containing agricultural biostimulants compared to two sulfur-based systems on foliar and fruit diseases, pest and beneficial arthropods, tree growth, yield and fruit quality on four cultivars, `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 and `Liberty 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7. Trees were arranged in a complete randomized design of five three-tree replications in a certified organic orchard.

Each biostimulant application also included kelp meal, unsulfured organic molasses and yucca extract emulsifier. The biostimulant system did not successfully manage apple scab and rust diseases as well as the sulfur-based fungicide systems, and had variable results with other diseases. No differences were observed among the three systems in tree growth parameters; however, the length of the study may not have been sufficient to determine effects. Differences in the incidence of disease among the three systems were reflected in extrapolated figures for gross income per hectare which takes into account fruit yield and quality. In the higher fruit-bearing year of the study, it was estimated that the gross income per hectare of the biostimulant system would be significantly lower than the reduced-sulfur system and the full-sulfur system by at least 5, 800 and 12, 000, respectively. In that same year, it is estimated that the full-sulfur system would have generated approximately 6, 500 more gross income per hectare than the reduced-sulfur system suggesting the number of sulfur sprays can influence fruit quality and income.

40|$|Rescuing biochar: Pre - {{application}} techniques to enhance plant responses to biochar additions: Nigel Gale, U of Toronto A {{growing body of}} literature indicates variable responses of different plant species to biochar, including positive, neutral, and negative, suggesting {{that it is important}} to investigate the nature and mechanism of species-specific responses to biochar additions. Neutral or negative plant responses to additions of biochars have commonly been reported in prior studies, and are likely the result of a combination of changes in soil properties (e. g. pH, surface area, and nutrient and water retention) and the production of volatile organic compounds from pyrolysis. In a series of greenhouse studies in Toronto, Ontario, we tested the effects of: dosage (0, 5, 10, 20, 50 t/ha); biochar type (Maple batch and Spruce batch 475 °C, Maple flow-through 575 °C); and application method (complete mixing vs. top dressing) on the growth and performance of two temperate species commonly used as forage crops and for erosion control: Lolium multiflorum, and Trifolium repens. Freshly produced biochars generally resulted in neutral or negative biomass and leaf area responses regardless of the dosage, biochar type, or application method. Pyrolysis typically produces biochars that contain significant amounts of volatile organic compounds that may have substantial inhibitory effects on plant growth. We subsequently tested methods to ameliorate effects of toxic compounds sorbed by biochars during production, using washing (with water and oil) and convection heating (50 - 150 °C) techniques prior to biochar application. Preliminary results demonstrated that heating biochars at 100 - 150 °C for 24 hours reduced toxic effects exhibited in leaf area by 20 % for Lolium grown in mixed biochars applications. Similarly, Lolium grown in water-washed biochars showed a 17 % increase in leaf area relative to non-washed controls in soils where biochar was applied as a top dressing. Our results suggest that pre-application heating and/or washing treatments may substantially enhance plant responses to biochar, in some cases reversing negative effects. Intuitive Inoculation: Doug Clayton, Dale Hendricks Pre-treating biochar by incorporating it into the composting process has become standard practice for many gardeners, small farmers and permaculturists. Doug and Dale have not only been layering biochar into their compost piles but also pre-soaking their biochars in <b>liquid</b> <b>fish</b> and seaweed fertilizers, molasses, fermented teas, human urine, etc. We are suggesting that incorporating biochar into a comprehensive combination of “composting” processes (hot, cold, vermi-, ferments, etc.), using all of nature’s avenues for breaking down organic matter, may provide a superior biochar treatment. There may be no better inoculation of biochar than that achieved by passing it through a worm’s gut. Both “red wigglers” and “night crawlers” make this an easy process to achieve. Worms thrive in finely ground, urine soaked biochar. Biochar can assist with the efficient and safe recycling of urine, maintaining the fertility of hundreds of square feet of garden plot, giving those who already have fertile soil, and seemingly lack a problem for biochar to fix, an avenue of beneficial use. We will show compost nutrient level test results and pictures of our processes and plant trials...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine quality of smoked catfish (Arius thalassinus) using paddy chaff and coconut shell <b>liquid</b> smoke. The <b>fish</b> were divided into two groups; then processed using paddy chaff and coconut shell liquid smoke. All of the smoked catfish samples were subjected to chemical, microbiological and organoleptic analyses. The result indicated that moisture content of the paddy chaff smoked cat fish was 48. 72 %; a little bit lower than coconut shell smoked cat fish that was 51. 27 %. TPC on paddy chaff treatment was 53. 33 CFU/gr; higher than coconut shell treatment that was 46. 67 CFU/gr. Organoleptic value of smoked cat fish treated by paddy chaff liquid smoke was 8. 26 and coconut shell was 8. 22. It was found that benzo(α) pyrene content in the paddy chaff liquid smoke was not detected and in the coconut shell liquid smoke was 11. 351 ppm. Examination of t-test Independent sample to the TPC and moisture content showed P> 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : {{the problem}} faced in smoking fish is {{primarily}} related to deterioration of lipid caused by oxidation, that may cause of omega- 3 fatty acid content in fish. This research {{was aimed at}} investigating the effect of different method of smoking fish to the organoleptic value, proximate composition and omega- 3 fatty acid content. The experiment {{was carried out in}} The Laboratory of Coastal Zone Ecodevelopment, Diponegoro University, Jepara. Analysis of omega- 3 fatty acid was conducted using Shimadzu Gas Chromathography in The Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Fisheries, Japan. Material and Method : a randomized design was used in this study; filleted skipjack tuna (Eutynnus affinis); approximately 125 gr in weight and about 25 cm in length was used in both coconut shell for the traditional method and liquid smoke from Giulini Chemii for modern method. The temperature of the smoking process was between 40 – 80 °C. Sensory test and proximate composition were determined in order to support an omega- 3 fatty acid analysis. Result and Discussion : the average value of sensory test of traditional smoked tuna was between 3. 00 – 8. 33; liquid smoked tuna was between 6. 67 – 9. 00. the protein composition was 38. 98 % and lipid was 2. 71 % for the traditional product and 32. 21 % and 2. 06 % were obtained in liquid smoked tuna. Analysis of DHA resulted in 17. 6 % (traditional) and 20. 9 (liquid). The results showed a significant difference between two products. The product of <b>liquid</b> smoked <b>fish</b> had better appearance, longer shelf life and higher omega- 3 fatty acid content...|$|R
40|$|Production of silage {{for animal}} feed by {{acidification}} of {{whole fish or}} offal was investigated {{as a means of}} utilizing periodic gluts including small purseseined fish. Fifty-three samples, each of 4 - 10 kg, were selected over 14 months and subjected to various degrees of comminution. Samples were hand-mixed in a plastic bucket with quantities of 85 percent formic acid, usually 3. 5 percent by weight, and kept indoors in covered buckets at ambient temperatures of 10 - 30 °C. All whole fish liquefied satisfactorily; offal tended to liquefy at a slowcr rate, have a more pungent odour and appeared to need more than 3. 5 percent acid. Comminution was unnecessary f m small fish, e. g. anchovies (Stolephonrs spp.), but filefish (Monocanthus spp.) and offal needed mincing. Scads (Decapterus and Trachurus spp.) and similar fish of 10 - 15 cm length needed mincing in the winter, but a coarser comminution, or none at all, was adequate in the summer. Stirring facilitated liquefaction, which varied in speed from 12 h to five weeks. Final viscosity varied; scads producing a glutinous product in the winter, anchovies a watery <b>liquid.</b> Whole <b>fish</b> silages maintained a pleasantly malty smell for one to six months. Deterioration involved the formation of a mould (Aspergil-lus) or infestation with a small dipterid fly. Crude protein was assayed at 15. 6 - 17;O percent and fat at 1. 2 - 7. 0 percent for whole fish. A limited trial showed that whole fish silage supported adequate growth in weaner pigs when incorporated in a cereal-based feed. Possible lines of future development including a small-scale plant for mechanized batch production are discussed...|$|R
