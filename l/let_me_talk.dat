500|$|Spiegelman blurs {{the line}} between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what Maus is {{becoming}} for him, he says to his wife, [...] "In real life you'd never have <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> this long without interrupting." [...] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. [...] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which [...] "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".|$|E
60|$|PRESS. [Laying down-his note-book] I say, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> {{to you as}} man to man for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know it, and I wish unspeakably {{you would}} give it up--it isn't good--it's a great mistake. Stay here and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{appreciate}} your <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you, but it's cold and getting late, {{and you have}} sat on deck long enough. I'll see that somebody looks after the animals." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{she laid}} a hand on his, saying, [...] "I have longed to talk openly to you ever since we met in the cow-shed; but I could not make any advance to any of you, because," [...] she whispered in haste, [...] "I thought it my duty to hold back from Frank. And now, till we go away, Camilla watches me and {{occupies}} me every minute, will not even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ride out with papa. I wonder she <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you now." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Enough About <b>Me</b> (<b>Let's</b> <b>Talk</b> About You)" [...] (Bill LaBounty, Norm Bishop) - 2:58 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{trying to}} tell you about that, if you'd only shut up a second and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk.</b> You don't give a fellow a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She mostly <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to her," [...] confessed Mr Powell. [...] "I don't {{know that}} she was very much interested--but still she let me. She, never cut me short." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--I'm {{coming to}} him. But you--you did mean it that way, too. You sounded--yust {{like all the}} rest. [Hysterically.] But, damn it, shut up! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> for a change! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{alluded to}} them yourself. You {{know that they}} cannot be forgotten. What do you expect? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>talk</b> to you in figurative language. It happens {{sometimes}} that a tree is struck by lightning and killed in an instant--leaf, branch, and root--killed and turned to dust and ashes." ...|$|R
60|$|Alon. You {{told me that}} before, sir; do {{you speak}} oracles, that you require this strict attention? Either <b>let</b> <b>me</b> share the <b>talk</b> with you, or I am gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been making}} rather a trouble of it, old girl," [...] he said affectionately. [...] "It's no good doing that, you know. You wait and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>talk</b> with Henry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. Whatever his {{feelings}} are, he must {{act as a}} gentleman and an officer. Just you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> it over with him. He has great respect for all I say; I've noticed that already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly {{it is both}} {{food and}} rest that I want, at the proper times, but what I want with you now, is {{to take me to}} your own room, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and {{sit down}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you," [...] he replied. Then he {{led her to the}} sofa, and as she seated herself I doubt whether she had not almost {{forgotten}} that her husband was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "After I {{get back}} from my ride I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come and <b>talk</b> with you. Perhaps," [...] he added, [...] "you'll {{be able to walk}} a little way with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know very}} well," [...] she said, [...] "that you never {{intended}} to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> marry him. As I said to you last night, I feel very much aggrieved, Major Mallett. You had said you would be my friend, and yet you let this go on when you could have stopped it at once. You <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get <b>talked</b> about with that man, {{and you would have}} gone on <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> get still more talked about before you interfered. That was not kind or friendly of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Only a {{carriage}} {{with a man}} and a woman in it,” he said, “You <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do the <b>talking</b> if old yellow‐face wants to turn us out of here. Anyway, if I go, what’s left of the wine goes with me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think it}} was the {{champagne}} at Gaunt House, don't you? It ain't that. Come in; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you for a minute. I'll tell you what it is. D----it, let me tell somebody," [...] Foker said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got a {{prisoner}} in there named Blake," [...] went on Pan. [...] "I once lived near him. He used to play horse with me and ride me on his back. Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have wanted}} to talk to you so much. The first time I saw you.... At first I dared not.... I did not know you would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk....</b> And now, just as I am--happy, you are going." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{start off}} with Martin recalling: [...] "Was a long and dark December/From the rooftops I remember/There was snow". Martin {{emphasizes}} towards the thoughts of a soldier going into battle. The line [...] "If you love <b>me,</b> why'd you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go?", <b>talks</b> about a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. The song ends with Martin playing the piano and singing, and pleading in nearly spoken-words: [...] "If you love <b>me,</b> won't you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know?" [...] In live performances of the song, he plays the piano part on his acoustic guitar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Boardotrade! I {{call that}} very mean. Mr. Houston is a gentleman, and the Buncombe {{property}} {{has been for}} ever so many hundreds {{of years in the}} family. I think more of Frank as to birth and all that than I do of Lord Boardotrade and his mushroom peerage. Can't you tell papa that I mean to marry Mr. Houston at last, and that he is making very little of <b>me</b> to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> be <b>talked</b> about as I shall be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} would be the best plan. My two aunts are the kindest creatures possible, but no doubt they will be bewildered at seeing me so suddenly. I do think {{it would be best to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>talk</b> with them, and tell them all about it, before you appear upon the scene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how did you}} manage?" [...] Bertram inquired {{with some}} diffidence. [...] "It raises a point you wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> about at Peshawur, but I've often felt guilty because I didn't insist. Traveling about as you have done is expensive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> {{a little}} with Hetty," [...] {{returned}} the party appealed to; [...] "Was the raft made a'ter you had got your breakfast, gal, and did you walk from the camp to the shore opposite to us, here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! don't {{bother me}} with such trifles just now," [...] cried Ruby, {{thrusting}} his uncle {{into a chair}} and resuming his own seat at his mother's side; [...] "we'll speak of that at some other time; meanwhile <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pop's {{just the}} same as he always is," [...] was the answer. [...] "And now, as I don't want to lose the whole of the seventy-five cents I've got to pay, suppose you call in that niece of yours, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>talk</b> with her. Perhaps I can get {{something}} interesting out of her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{have since}} agreed with Friedman and Schwartz's theory, {{including}} Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, who said: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> end my <b>talk</b> by abusing slightly my {{status as an}} official representative of the Federal Reserve. I {{would like to say}} to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.|$|R
40|$|Thank you {{for coming}} and <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> about the theory and {{practice}} of education. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> start with some observations about {{what we are trying to}} do, or what I think that we should be trying to do, with Education theory. And in thinking about Education theory, we should never forget that what we are actually dealing with is people – living, breathing, feeling individuals with their own purposes and intentions. In view of the diversity and range of individuals that is implied by that simple statement, it is perhaps surprising that we can predict anything about people. But we can predict some things with considerable accuracy – such as traffic jams at particular times of day or seasons of the year, or the sale of food in supermarkets. But if we try to predict everything about a person, then we are not respecting their individuality, their ability to make their own choices, and to exercise free will. Education theory should make predictions that are helpful for planners, but that respect the freedom and individuality of the personal decisions that each of us make. I have argued elsewhere that this means that Education theory should be based on three principles: ● It should be ethical in allowing scope for individual free will; ● It should be multi-centred in allowing that there is more than one correct way to develop one’s educational career; and ● It should allow for partial autonomy between levels of understanding, between the individual, the schoo...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is so, Bell; {{and why not}} say it? Do {{you think}} I never say it to myself in the hours when I am all alone, {{thinking}} over it--thinking, thinking, thinking. You must not,--you must not grudge to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> of it sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now I {{must stop}} chatting about myself, for I {{know that you}} cannot be {{interested}} in a simple old fogey such as I am. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you about your letter and about the difficult question it raises for all marriageable young men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Lester, it isn't any trick. I am Phil, your nephew. I {{want to talk}} to you. I've got {{the best}} kind of news for you; {{something}} that you'll be glad to hear. Won't you please open the door and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne Shirley, don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{hear you}} <b>talking</b> about your teacher {{in that way}} again," [...] said Marilla sharply. [...] "You don't go to school to criticize the master. I guess he can teach YOU something, and it's your {{business}} to learn. And I {{want you to understand}} right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him. That is something I won't encourage. I hope you were a good girl." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Run It!" [...] {{takes place}} in a party setting, with Brown explaining, [...] "It's really a guy {{checking}} for a girl, or a girl checking for a guy...asking {{to see if they can}} run it. If they can be eligible to be your girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. 'Let me see if you can run it; show me what you got.'" [...] "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)" [...] discusses the first conversation someone has with a girl: [...] "Fellas, first thing they say when they see a girl is 'Yo! Yo!'. I'm saying it like that, but technically not like that. She takes my breath away, all I can say is 'Yo, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>talk</b> to you for a minute. Chill with me for a minute.'" ...|$|R
40|$|Acknowledgements I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to thank my advisor, Dr. Yan Zhang, for his guidance and teaching from the first day I was accepted in to the Department of Medicinal Chemistry until now. I {{would also like to thank}} him for providing me with generous financial support. My day to day experiences in the lab could not have been successful without the help from Dr. Guo Li whose patience is endless. I would also like to thank Dr. Joy Ware in the Department of Pathology for the opportunity to work in her lab and gain valuable experience outside an organic chemistry lab and Amanda Richardson for her infinite help with cell culture as well as for always <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> about my mutts. I {{would like to}} thank the other members of Dr. Yan Zhang’s lab, past and present, for helping me learn more about organic chemistry and teamwork. To my friends, I would like to extend my gratitude for giving me friendship, support, and laughter. Thank you Genevieve, for always being willing to take a break. I am especially grateful to Nolan, for sitting through practices of seminars and listening to every detail about my day, and loving me anyway. I would like to thank my family for tolerating my extended stay in Virginia, for buying many plane tickets, and all their love and support. I would especially like to thank m...|$|R
