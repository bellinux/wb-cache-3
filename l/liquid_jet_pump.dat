The project will begin with a review of how the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> operates, aiming to give the reader an insight and overview into the field of an artificial lift method. Primary literature was gathered by searching the SPE online library whereby the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has received much attention in the literature.

In the case studies the design of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> parameters were achieved by searching available literature and the use of in-house software. The use of in-house software and the lack of field data presented made it difficult to compare field results with theoretical performances. In all case studies the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> increased production. * The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> proved to be very reliable * Low installation and operation costs and * Can be placed in highly deviated wells The above reasons can to some extent justify the low efficiency of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performed with efficiencies lower than expected at the different fields.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps).</b> The asymmetric shape of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> results in a time-averaged pressure drop {{that can be used}} to suppress Gedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices.

In this work, the characteristics of flow separation in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are identified and coupled with the observed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother transition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting in more effective and robust <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> To make the proposed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> designs more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance is investigated.

40|$|Thermoacoustic {{engines are}} an {{interesting}} alternative to conventional heat engines (such as Stirling engines) due {{to the absence of}} moving parts in the hot region and the small temperature difference required to operate. These engines can provide a durable solution in, for example, waste heat recovery applications. Using a traveling wave based configuration, consisting of a toroidal geometry, thermal-to-acoustic efficiencies of up to 30 % have been obtained. However, the traveling wave configuration has a major disadvantage: due to the closed looped geometry a time-averaged mass flow, known as "Gedeon streaming", can occur. This type of acoustic streaming can lead to a drastic reduction in efficiency or even prevent the engine from running. Therefore, control of Gedeon streaming is essential in the development of traveling wave thermoacoustic engines. A solution to avoid Gedeon streaming is the application of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump,</b> which is a component with one or more tapered holes. The oscillatory flow through such an asymmetric geometry results in a time-averaged pressure drop across the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> By balancing this time-averaged pressure drop with the pressure drop that exists across the regenerator of the thermoacoustic device, Gedeon streaming can be suppressed. In this thesis, the oscillatory flow in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> is analyzed. The relation between oscillatory flow features and the performance of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> is investigated. Based on this, <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> design guidelines have been formulated for laminar oscillatory flows. Flow separation is identified as a main source of performance loss in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> and can be avoided by introducing a smooth transition to the tapered inner surface.

We obtain useful information about the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> breakup, the region of breakup and, most importantly, the means of controlling the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> breakup. We also obtain an asymptotic solution to the <b>liquid</b> <b>jet</b> equations for large space and time limits...|$|R
30|$|In an oil field, {{when the}} crude cannot {{come to the}} surface on its own due to either low {{pressure}} differential or the fluid properties like high viscosity, artificial lift technology has to be used. The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> {{is one of the}} artificial lift techniques considered to be better than other lift systems because of no moving parts and simple working principle. This makes it easy to monitor and regulate. It works on the fluid power hence it can be placed at greater depths and at varying angles with respect to the horizontal. In a field, some wells are deeper than the others, while some are deviated. The performance of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is different for different cases as the parameters affecting it are the depth and the angle of placement. These aspects with respect to the working of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> need to be investigated and demonstrated. Hence, an effort has been made in this paper to design an experimental setup by which the pump efficiency with respect to depths and angles of placement can be easily determined. The experimental setup uses a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> driven by an electric motor of 2.5  kW along with a measurement setup. The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> was mounted on a hinged fixture and injection fluid from a centrifugal pump was used. The gate valve was used to throttle the flow for injection and create resistance across the delivery line of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> as a measure of increasing depth. These flow rates were used to characterize the performance of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are devices {{capable of}} pumping fluids {{to a higher}} {{pressure}} by inducing the motion of a secondary fluid employing a high speed primary fluid. The main components of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> are a primary nozzle, secondary fluid injectors, a mixing chamber, a throat, and a diffuser. The work described in this paper models the flow of a two-phase primary fluid inducing a secondary liquid (saturated or subcooled) injected into the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> mixing chamber. The model is capable of accounting for phase transformations due to compression, expansion, and mixing. The model is also capable of incorporating {{the effects of the}} temperature and pressure dependency in the analysis. The approach adopted utilizes an isentropic constant pressure mixing in the mixing chamber and at times employs iterative techniques to determine the flow conditions in the different parts of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} integrity of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> assembly of a {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) under hydrodynamic loading was evaluated. This arrangement, which has a riser joined {{with a couple of}} <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> by the transition piece, is part of the reactor recirculation system. It is submerged in water under pressure. The main function is to induce forced flow through the core of the reactor. A dynamic structural analysis was carried out with the finite element method. The first ten modes of vibration and their natural frequencies were calculated. The first five natural frequencies are in the range between 25 Hz and 40 Hz. In this analysis, it was considered that the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> assembly is supported at the riser brace. The restrainer bracket keeps together the riser with the two <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> and there is free movement at the slip joints...|$|R

This device is simple, reliable and light weight, and is attractive for various uses including eventual application to boundary layer control for aircraft. In this study the theoretical flow of a perfect gas through constant pressure and constant area <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> is predicted by analyzing the equations of continuity, energy and momentum. Of particular interest is the effect of heating the high energy jet. The parameters describing optimum heated <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are determined.
