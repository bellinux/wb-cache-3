5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} {{protecting}} her while she moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
50|$|After mating, {{the male}} will {{actively}} guard the female {{with whom he}} has mated by flying above <b>her</b> while she <b>lays</b> <b>her</b> eggs. He does this to prevent other males from mating with <b>her.</b> A female <b>lays</b> <b>her</b> eggs by dipping the tip of her abdomen in the water while hovering just above its surface.|$|R

5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs.|$|E
5|$|HMS Boadicea was {{the lead}} ship of her class of scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. She led the 1st Destroyer Flotilla from {{completion}} until the ship was transferred to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in mid-1912. A year later Boadicea was reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron and she spent the bulk of World War I with that squadron. The ship was present at, but did not fight in, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. Boadicea was converted into a minelayer at the end of 1917 and made three sorties to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> mines before the end of the war. She was placed in reserve after the war and taken out of service in 1920. The ship was used for harbour service at Dartmouth until she was sold for scrap in 1926.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E

5|$|It is {{gradually}} revealed that Ruka's father Souya had {{become obsessed with}} helping complete a ritual dance that would purify the islanders of the Hidden Moon Disease, which required {{the construction of a}} special mask for the dancer. Ruka herself became infected, and was treated at the sanatorium along with the other girls and the dancer, Haibara's sister Sakuya. The ritual was a catastrophic failure, with Sakuya reaching the final stage of the Hidden Moon Disease and falling into a coma, while the other girls collapsed and had their memories wiped. Two years after Ruka and Sayaka left the island, Sakuya woke and spread the Hidden Moon Disease across the island, killing all the inhabitants including Souya. To <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> to rest, the ritual must be completed, and for that her mask must be restored. Ruka comes into possession of all the mask fragments, which reform into the complete mask. Confronting Sakuya atop the island's lighthouse, she manages to pacify her with a sacred tune communicated to her by Sayaka, then Chōshirō puts the mask on Sakuya, completing the ritual and allowing all the island's spirits to pass into the afterlife. Depending on the game's difficulty setting, Misaki's fate is either left unknown, or her illness is cured after she is saved by Madoka's spirit and she leaves the island with Ruka.|$|E

25|$|The adult will finds a {{suitable}} host and remains {{on it and}} others in the same herd for life, with the female only leaving to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs. Horn flies will also move around to different areas on the same animal to regulate their temperature and minimize their exposure to the wind. Both the male and the female subsist completely on blood, using their sharp mouthparts to pierce the animal's hide to suck it out.|$|E
25|$|After emerging, females search rapidly for {{suitable}} host eggs {{by tapping}} their antennae over stems or barks of plants. When a telltale scar left by egg-laying insects is found, they will insert their antennae into the recess and {{check to see}} if the eggs are suitable. If they are, she will thrust her ovipositor into all of the eggs and <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> own eggs inside in quick succession. She retains contact with each of the eggs with her antennae while doing this.|$|E
25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for a few more weeks before setting out on their own.|$|E

50|$|The female goby <b>lays</b> <b>her</b> fertilized eggs on a hard, {{sheltered}} surface, {{like the}} inside of an empty conch shell. The male can mate with several females, and each mate <b>lays</b> <b>her</b> eggs in a single location. The cluster is then protected by the male until the eggs hatch. These males are often extremely territorial, and will chase off intruders. The young gobies can then grow up to an average of about 7.5 cm.|$|R

25|$|The {{reproductive}} P. barbatus caste {{is responsible}} for the formation of new colonies. A single queen ant establishes every colony. Large numbers of winged male ants and virgin queen ants fly to mating aggregation sites following midsummer monsoon rains. To found a successful colony, P. barbatus queens must mate with males from two separate lineages. One lineage results in ants that become the workers of the colony. These are the ants responsible for the nonreproductive tasks of the colony. The other lineage produces reproductive female ants. After mating with the male ants at the aggregation site, the queen flies away to establish a new colony. Upon arriving at her new nest site, the queen loses her wings and builds a nest in the soil. The entrance into the nest is then sealed off to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs in safety. With this, the colony is born. Over the course of the following six to eight weeks, the primary brood of nonreproductive worker ants emerges and begins to forage and build the colony.|$|E
500|$|The Russians' own minefields were {{larger than}} had been expected, and so {{clearing}} them took longer than the Germans had planned. This delay was compounded by stiff resistance from the Russian navy; Deutschland was ultimately unable to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> mines. Reports of Allied submarine activity in the area prompted {{the withdrawal of the}} German naval force on the morning of 20 August. Indeed, the battlecruiser Moltke had been torpedoed by the British submarine [...] the day before, though only minor damage was sustained.|$|E
500|$|Diana, Princess of Wales was interred on a {{small island}} {{in the middle of}} the {{ornamental}} Round Oval lake, which was created by Teulon in 1868. The island was decided as the best place to <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> to rest because the water would, according to Spencer, [...] "act as a buffer against the interventions of the insane and ghoulish, the thick mud presenting a further line of defence. We all agreed that, with its beauty and tranquillity, this was the place for Diana to be". [...] The ground was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough prior to the burial. [...] Her burial place is marked with a white memorial plinth and urn.|$|E

500|$|The clutch size {{is almost}} always two eggs. Occasionally, however, a female will <b>lay</b> <b>her</b> eggs in the nest of another pair, leading {{to three or four}} eggs in the nest. The eggs are white, , [...] long, [...] wide, [...] at laying (5–6% of female body mass). Both sexes incubate, the male from morning to afternoon, and the female {{the rest of the day}} and at night. Mourning doves are devoted parents; nests are very rarely left {{unattended}} by the adults. When flushed from the nest, an incubating parent may perform a nest-distraction display, or a broken-wing display, fluttering on the ground as if injured, then flying away when the predator approaches it.|$|E
