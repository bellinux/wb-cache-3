You have to find what graduate/medical school and especially residency is right for you. You must be selfmotivated to study and perform you best. When it comes to residency, finding the correct “fit” is most important. You will spend more time with your co-residents and attendings than your family members through this time in your life. You must like the education you will receive in your residency, but more importantly, you must like or learn to like the people you work with. This is a life skill that is invaluable. Work should not become a chore. You should wake up every day and enjoy what you do. Find a career in medicine that fits your personality, lifestyle and long-term goals.

40|$|The path to optometry, {{although}} at times challenging, is extremely rewarding. I personally had my eyes set on becoming an optometrist since I was 16 years old, when I attended a Dual Enrollment program called College Academy at Broward College. I had graduated {{high school with}} an Associate of Arts degree, and therefore by the time I attended Farquhar, I knew what my long-term goals were. I {{was lucky enough to}} be accepted into the Dual Admission program for optometry, in which I had a guaranteed seat in NSU’s optometry school once I completed my three years at Farquhar. It is a disciplined program that helps guide you to fulfilling all of the requirements needed to enter into any optometry school. I had two years of college under my belt, and had learned that schools like students to be well-rounded, either with other majors/minors, or extracurricular activities. Due to this, I received my Bachelors in Biology as well as minors in Psychology and Literature. By 2010 I was accepted into NSU’s Optometry school. The first semester was very tough, although the material first year is pretty much repeating the general science classes I had taken during undergraduate year. However, Farquhar is a sprint and Optometry school is a marathon. This is when I realized that I needed to change the ways that I studied in order to do better, and by the time second semester rolled around I had changed {{a lot of things about}} myself. My main tips on transitioning from undergraduate programs to graduate programs are: 1) Change your studying skills if you need to 2) Make lots of friends 3) Balance your life 4) Say yes to as many opportunities as you can Once I graduated in 2014 I felt like I could accomplish anything.

5000|$|Afflalo {{attended}} Centennial High School {{two years}} ahead of rapper Kendrick Lamar, who credited Afflalo's academic and athletic achievements in the first verse of the song [...] "Black Boy Fly", a bonus track from his album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. In the song, Lamar described Afflalo {{as an example of}} someone who had the [...] "determination, ambition plus dedication and wisdom" [...] to get out of Compton. Afflalo nodded towards Lamar's drive in an interview with XXL, saying [...] "I was almost like the golden child in the city of Compton, or at least at Centennial at that time, considering where I was as a basketball player, and all the positivity I had around me, in terms of school and people appreciating me and showing me <b>love</b> for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on the court and in the community at that time in my life. So for him to kind of be in the background and who he is today, it showed you the perseverance that he had for so many years." ...|$|R

But as his studies dove deeper into the complex symbolism of Asian thought, he developed a broader view, and became himself a deeply spiritual man. Blofeld mentored Red Pine in his translation work. According to Red Pine, Blofeld [...] "was a very sincere Buddhist who practiced every night for several hours and <b>loved</b> <b>what</b> he <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> don't think he ever stopped learning." ...|$|R

[...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old <b>loves</b> you.' <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." ...|$|R
