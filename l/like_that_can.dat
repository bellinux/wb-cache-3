5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
500|$|Despite these partnerships, PewDiePie {{maintains}} that he conducts very few promotions {{and works with}} few brands. Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't end up doing many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it. Things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> bring me down. But it's not personal; some people just prefer to believe the worst about others at any given time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{editorial}} cartoonists {{quoted by}} The Washington Post blogger Michael Cavna were {{critical of the}} Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to. [...] The president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists opposed involvement because, [...] "something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression." [...] Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, [...] "childish and needlessly provocative," [...] or demurred because they dislike, [...] "choreographed punditry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peterson {{believed}} he was a player that a franchise could build around. In an interview with IGN following the NFL Draft, he said, [...] "I'm a player who is coming in with the determination to turn a team around. I want to help my team get to the playoffs, win...and run wild. I want to bring people to the stands. I want {{people to come to}} the game to see what I can do next. Things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> change the whole attitude of an organization. I want to win." [...] He later told the Star Tribune in an interview, [...] "I want to be the best player to ever play this game." [...] Nearly three months after being drafted, he was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2007. His contract was worth $40.5 million over five years, with $17 million guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> get your arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{announced}} that Sandé had begun writing sessions with Alicia Keys and Chris Martin of Coldplay. Sandé said {{working with the}} pair was like a [...] "dream come true". Simon Cowell showed his support for Sandé {{and said she was}} his [...] "favourite songwriter at the moment". After she began penning tracks for the likes of Cher Lloyd, Susan Boyle, Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis who are all signed to Cowell's record label, Syco Music. She also revealed that it was never an option to go out and sing other artists' songs which they had written for her. She wanted the whole album to be her own, and every song to be written by herself. She said [...] "For me to feel empowered by music, it has to be my own. The message that the lyric carries is as important to me as singing in tune. Not everyone is a writer or wants to be, so shows <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be a great way of getting exposure – and as we're all aware, this is a tough industry to break into. I just know I'd have found it very difficult to go out and sing other people's songs week after week, though. It simply wouldn't have felt truthful." ...|$|E
