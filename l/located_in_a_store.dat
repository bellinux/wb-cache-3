40|$|Do {{promotions}} in {{a certain}} category lead to higher revenues in other categories? If so, to what degree? The {{answers to these questions}} are highly relevant for retailers that supply products in different categories. Empirical findings in studies that consider a limited number of categories indicate small promotional cross-category effects. This study develops a framework to determine the impact of price promotions on category revenues that include interdependencies among a substantial number of categories at the category demand level. The own- and cross-category demand effects are moderated by variables such as promotion intensity, category characteristics (own-category effects), and spatial distances between shelf locations (cross-category effects). The empirical results based on daily store-level scanner data show that approximately half of all price promotions expand own-category revenues, especially for categories with deeper supported discounts. There is a high probability (61 %) that a price promotion affects sales of at least one other category. The number of categories affected is not greater than two. Moderate evidence supports the existence of cross-promotional effects between categories more closely <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{pervasive}} business model for sales promotion in retail chain stores utilizing WLAN localization and {{near field communication}} (NFC) technologies. The objectives of the model are to increase the customers’ flow of the stores and their incentives in purchasing. In the proposed model, the NFC technology is used as the first mean to motivate customers {{to come to the}} stores. Then, with the use of WLAN, the movements of the customers, who are carrying smartphones, within the stores are captured and maintained in the movement database. By interpreting the movements of customers as indicators of their interests to the displayed items, personalized promotion strategies can be formulated to increase their incentives for purchasing future items. Various issues in the application of the adopted localization scheme for <b>locating</b> customers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> are discussed. To facilitate the item management and space utilization in displaying the items, we propose an enhanced R-tree for indexing the data items maintained in the movement database.

50|$|Although {{the first}} {{settlers}} {{arrived in the}} area during the 1870s, a community did not develop until the mid-1880s. The community received its name because the only telephone in the area was <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general <b>store</b> owned by Pete Hindman. When Hindman applied for permission to open a post office, authorities repeatedly refused his submissions because the suggested names were already used by other post offices in the state. He finally submitted the name Telephone, which was accepted, and the post office opened in 1886. By 1890, Telephone had an estimated population of 30. The community continued to grow and by the outbreak of World War I, the number of residents had increased to 100. Unlike many rural communities in Texas during the Great Depression, Telephone's population remained stable at around 100. By the mid-1940s, the community had ten businesses and 280 residents. In 1990, Telephone had six businesses, a post office, and an estimated population of 210. That figure remained unchanged as of 2000, and still remains unchanged as of 2010.|$|R

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1958, Ganzhorn studied {{marine biology}} at UC Berkeley. She {{worked at the}} Hopkins Marine Station after graduation, but when her son was born, she had an epiphany. “I didn’t want to do {{research}} anymore. I {{wanted to do something}} based on human needs. I wanted to do something that wasn’t esoteric, that was more basic and vital,” Ganzhorn said in her interview. She found meaningful work at the Homeless Garden Project, where she interned in 1991, not long after the Project was started by UCSC philosophy professor and social visionary Paul Lee. Influenced by the ideas of the radical educator Myles Horton, Ganzhorn began to edit “Voices from the Garden,” a series of newsletter profiles of homeless people who worked in the Garden. This interviewing experience infused her with an appreciation for oral history that she brought to the interview conducted by Irene Reti on February 12 and 19 th, 2009, in the modest offices of the Homeless Garden Project, <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> former liquor <b>store</b> not far from the Pacific Ocean in Santa Cruz.

40|$|In the 2006 {{edition of}} the AlMA journal (Hardy et al, 2006) we {{reported}} preliminary research undertaken {{in order to determine}} the effectiveness of combining the federation of maritime archaeological data with semantic search to enable archaeologists to share data. The central question for this research has been to discover whether archaeological information can be made available via a data sharing mechanism. Two additional research questions were also considered: 1. Are there tools available to federate or combine these datasets? 2. How can the search results be appropriately targeted when searching across a variety of data sources? This paper reports the results of the research which indicate that while it is possible to allow access to maritime archaeological datasets using a data federation system that a 1 so employs semantic search (Richards 2006), the usability of such a system can be problematic given the current state of maritime archaeological data and the relatively low level of access to IT infrastructure and technical support by archaeologists, Archaeological datasets are often created <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ad hoc, as-needed fashion that results in the production of files and databases without a uniform structure across archaeological projects (Snow 2006). Due to this lack of consistency across databases, it is very difficult to create a centralized data sharing system, that is capable of handling a multitude offormats and internal organizational schemes. <b>In</b> addition, for <b>an</b> archaeologist to use a data sharing system, significant infrastructure (i. e. underlying networks, software and hardware) must be put in place. At present these support mechanisms are still in the development stage especially as they pertain to research in the social sciences. During the course of this research, a survey of archaeologists working in Australia was undertaken, and then using the information gained from the survey. two software implementation studies were implemented using sample datasets provided by three maritime archaeological research groups (Heritage NSW, Heritage Victoria and Townsville Maritime Museum). Each software study considered the effectiveness of an individual software program <b>in</b> providing <b>a</b> mechanism for the federation of data and semantic searching of data. <b>A</b> primary concern <b>in</b> accessing data is to find resources that are of value to the researcher. Federation and semantic search provide this ability, A federation is a collection of distributed resources that can be searched as if they were grouped,vithin a single system, The data appears to be <b>located</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> central data <b>store,</b> but is actually found in many separate locations. Semantic interoperability, or semantic search entails having a system with the ability to search for digital information across multiple sources that is capable of discerning which datasets are of interest through the use of metadata or schemas. ...|$|R

Arrangement of shelves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> {{which is one of}} in-store promotion strategies, is extremely important for a supermarket to increase sales, because many customers decide what to buy in the store, which is called “unplanned purchase”. However, we cannot experiment with several cases easily to determine the ideal arrangement of shelves, because <b>an</b> experiment <b>in</b> <b>an</b> actual <b>store</b> requires <b>a</b> lot of money and a heavy load. The behavior of customers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> is <b>a</b> typical example of complex systems. Therefore we use MA to carry out an analysis of movement of customers through <b>a</b> pathway <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store.</b> MA enables us to express the movement of customers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> considering the degree of attraction of goods on the shelves in several cases of “planned purchase ” and “unplanned purchase ” of customers.
