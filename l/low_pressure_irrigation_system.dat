40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation to improve application uniformity and reduce energy requirements haste led to problems of water application and potential surface runoff, {{which in turn}} have highlighted {{the importance of the}} soil and cultivation practice in making best use of irrigation water. The objective {{of this study was to}} begin the development of a mathematical model, which will simulate the operation of current sprinkler-soil-crop system, in order to provide a means of predicting surface runoff and so provide a more effective approach to system design. A model has now been developed which will predict runoff from a small simple agricultural catchment in the form of a ridge and furrow ciltivation system. The model is based on the kinematic wave theory involving the continuity equation and the simplified momentum equation. A four-point implicit finite difference scheme is used to solve numerically the kinematic wave equations. The model (SROFF) may be used to predict the runoff at various times from a simple catchment with different slopes, water application rates and soil infiltration rate. A further development of the model was made by the introduction of the interception loss model (INCEPT) to predict the amount of water intercepted by the crop canopy during irrigation. The validity of the model was tested and supported by the results of laboratory experiments conducted on two soil samples with different infiltration rates, using three different application rates. The performance of the model was also evaluated by statistical test. There was good agreement between experiment and model results. The results indicated that this model can provide valuable information for the effective design of sprinkler systems, particularly where runoff may be a potential problem. This is particularly the case with current <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> but equally the problem is common with high pressure systems when applied to soils with low infiltration rates...|$|R

The significant financial investment and the long period over which the investment runs is also complicated by the uncertainty associated with long term input costs (such as energy), crop production, and the continually evolving natural resource management rules and policy.

At present the use of furrow irrigation {{is by far the}} most common form due to the ease of use, relatively low operating cost and well established infrastructure currently in place. The Mulgrave Area Farmer Integrated Action (MAFIA) grower group, located near Clare in the lower Burdekin region, identified the need to learn about sustainable farming systems with a focus on the environment, social and economic implications. In early 2007, Hesp Faming established a site to investigate the use of overhead irrigation as an alternative to furrow irrigation and its integration with new farming system practices, including Green Cane Trash Blanketing (GCTB). Although significant environmental and social benefits exist, the preliminary investment analysis indicates that the Overhead <b>Low</b> <b>Pressure</b> (OHLP) <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> is not adding financial value to the Hesp Farming business.

The region accounts for half of the total area of China, but has less than 20 % of total national available water resources. While the water shortage in this region is severe, irrigation water use efficiency is only about 40 %, with a typical agricultural water use efficiency of about 0. 46 kg m 3. Excessive irrigation in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia has had a significant influence on downstream water users along the Yellow River. It is widely believed that an increase in the agricultural water use efficiency is the key to mitigating water shortage and reducing environmental problems.

40|$|Due {{to climate}} change, {{the amount of}} rainfall, and its uneven {{temporal}} and spatial distribution, affect water availability. As a result, both households and farmers need to adapt to climate change by taking appropriate actions. This dissertation incorporates insights from scholarship on both {{adaptation to climate change}} and innovation adoption. For residents, adopting drought tolerant plants (DTPs) to conserve water use is a potential adaptation to the predicted effects of climate change. Survey responses from 624 households in Missouri are analyzed using a univariate probit model. DTPs adoption is positively correlated with both low and high household incomes, homeownership, living in rural subdivisions, mowing lawns high, time spent on yardwork, pro-environmental attitudes, and concerns about droughts. Policy interventions might include subsidizing the purchase of DTPs, requirements for use of DTPs in new housing developments, and targeted educational efforts. To encourage farmers to conserve water and use water more efficiently, understanding their decision-making on adoption of enhanced <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> and scientific scheduling practices is essential. Using data from the national 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) conducted by USDA, this dissertation employs a mixed and multilevel approach to analyze both land- and crop-specific irrigation decisions. Three land-level equations on irrigation share, irrigation application rate, and harvest share are estimated. Results show that irrigation share, application rate and harvest share are associated with variables related to water costs, farm size, <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> barriers to improvements, information sources, etc. In addition, the adoption decisions are analyzed focusing on corn and soybean farms using multilevel models (MLMs) as they can better deal with the farm-level data embedded in states. Application of MLMs to the analysis of farmers' adoption provides new insights on the proportion of variability in each response accounted for by farm- versus state-level factors. The results suggest that, while adoption is affected by land areas, off-farm surface water, various barriers and information sources, the variability of <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> adoption is mainly accounted for by factors at the state level, while the adoption of scientific scheduling practices is mainly accounted for by farm-level variation. Controlling for farm-level factors, farmers in areas with drought conditions in 2012, i. e., lower than average rainfall and higher than average temperatures, {{are more likely to have}} adopted <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> and scientific scheduling practices by 2013. In addition, sustainability of water resources requires producers to take account of marginal user costs when making production decisions. Adoption of enhanced <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> and higher water cost can achieve potential improvements in irrigation water use efficiency. In a multicrop production <b>system</b> with <b>irrigation,</b> farmers make decisions about land allocated to each crop, irrigation water application, and their decisions, along with growing conditions, determine crop supply. This dissertation also analyses water application to multiple crops at the farm level and the effects of influential factors on irrigation water use efficiency of specific crops. As MLMs permit the incorporation of state-level variables, they are further applied in analyzing the multicrop production decisions and irrigation water use efficiency. The results show higher water price encourages efficient water use. Moreover, adoption of <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> could reduce soybean water use or increase corn yield. Adoption of <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> increases the economic irrigation water use efficiency on soybean farms. The findings from MLMs show that variables representing deviations from 30 year state average climate conditions in 2012 and 2013 have fairly consistent effects. Climate risks and higher temperatures promote more efficient water use and higher yields. Higher precipitation is correlated with lower water application and higher crop yield. Federal programs and policy should not only target specific barriers and increase the effectiveness of incentives at the farm level, but also address differing priorities in each state. Implications from these analyses should benefit future policy design and improve education programs...|$|R

The amount of residual smear layer and debris was evaluated at the scannig electron microscope analysis, and a semi-qualitative score was assigned to each tooth at the coronal, medium and apical third of the root canals. A nonparametric test was performed to compare the results of the S. E. M. analysis. Results: no significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found between the two irrigation methods in the removal of smear layer in the whole lenght of the root canal walls.

Integrated high <b>pressure</b> (IHP) <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> is a hardware and software setup that supposedly delivers savings in water, energy and costs and reduces irrigation’s environmental footprints. This paper discusses a spreadsheet model of horticulture production systems in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) which is a user of surface water diverted from the Murrumbidgee River. The annual water use entitlement for MIA is 1, 253, 000 mega litre. Horticulture (citrus and grapes) is the major high-return land use following the broad acre crops (rice and wheat) in MIA and constitutes a major portion of Australian Horticulture export. Horticulture contributes around 37 % of total value o...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate in vivo the revascularization and the apical and periapical repair after endodontic treatment using 2 techniques for root canal disinfection (apical negative <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> versus apical positive <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> plus triantibiotic intracanal dressing) in immature dogs` teeth with apical periodontitis. Study design. Two test groups of canals with experimentally induced apical periodontitis were evaluated according to the disinfection technique: Group 1, apical negative <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> (EndoVac <b>system),</b> and Group 2, apical positive <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> (conventional irrigation) plus triantibiotic intracanal dressing. In Group 3 (positive control), periapical lesions were induced, but no endodontic treatment was done. Group 4 (negative control) was composed of sound teeth. The animals were killed after 90 days and the maxillas and mandibles were subjected to histological processing. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Mallory Trichrome and examined under light microscopy. A description of the apical and periapical features was done and scores were attributed to the following histopathological parameters: newly formed mineralized apical tissue, periapical inflammatory infiltrate, apical periodontal ligament thickness, dentin resorption, and bone tissue resorption. Intergroup comparisons were done by the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn`s tests (alpha = 0. 05). Results. Although statistically significant difference was found only for the inflammatory infiltrate (P <. 05), Group 1 presented more exuberant mineralized formations, more structured apical and periapical connective tissue, and a more advanced repair process than Group 2. Conclusion. From the histological observations, sodium hypochlorite irrigation with the EndoVac system can be considered as a promising disinfection protocol in immature teeth with apical periodontitis, suggesting that the use of intracanal antibiotics might not be necessary.

40|$|The growing water {{scarcity}} worldwide puts <b>pressure</b> on <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> as main consumptive user to improve performance. In developing countries, where today agricultural water use is often still heavily subsidised, a tendency exists of introducing water pricing policies to stimulate rational water use. The exact impact of water pricing policies {{in terms of}} water saving or {{its effect on the}} farmers¿ production systems remains unknown. This study introduces a new two-stage method that allows estimating at farm level the effects on the agricultural production process and water demand of introducing or raising a water price. In the first stage the technical efficiency frontier is constructed and the technical and allocative efficiency levels of each farm are calculated. This representation of the technology is used in the second stage in a profit maximization model. Applying the method to small-scale irrigators in South Africa, it is shown that water demand of farmers is quite responsive even to small changes in the water price. Furthermore, introduction of a water price is found to significantly decrease farm profit, which is particularly problematic for poor farmers...|$|R
40|$|A great {{challenge}} for the agricultural sector is to produce more food from less water, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions which suffer from water scarcity. A {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of three irrigation methods, using effluent versus fresh water, on water savings, yields and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). The irrigation scheduling was based on soil moisture and rooting depth monitoring. The experimental design was a split plot with three main treatments, namely subsurface drip (SSD), surface drip (SD) and furrow irrigation (FI) and two sub-treatments effluent and fresh water, which were applied with three replications. The experiment was conducted at the Marvdasht city (Southern Iran) wastewater treatment plant during 2005 and 2006. The experimental results indicated that the average water applied in the irrigation treatments with monitoring was much less than that using the conventional irrigation method (using furrows but based on a constant irrigation interval, without moisture monitoring). The maximum water saving was obtained using SSD with 5907  m 3  ha- 1 water applied, and the minimum water saving was obtained using FI with 6822  m 3  ha- 1. The predicted irrigation water requirements using the Penman-Monteith equation (considering 85 % irrigation efficiency for the FI method) was 10, 743  m 3  ha- 1. The <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> (SSD and SD) led to a greater yield compared to the surface method (FI). The highest yield (12. 11  ×  103  kg ha- 1) was obtained with SSD and the lowest was obtained with the FI method (9. 75 x   103  kg ha- 1). The irrigation methods indicated a highly significant difference in irrigation water use efficiency. The maximum IWUE was obtained with the SSD (2. 12  kg m- 3) and the minimum was obtained with the FI method (1. 43  kg m- 3). Irrigation with effluent led to a greater IWUE compared to fresh water, but the difference was not statistically significant.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare two ways of water {{delivering}} in an irrigation scheme, considering the investment and maintenance costs: high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>irrigation</b> scheme considered is the “Circuito Hidráulico de Baleizão-Quintos”, included in the Multi-purpose Project of Alqueva. The scheme is divided in 5 blocks, with a gross scheme area of 7992 ha. The secondary aim is to determine for the blocks that in the original project require pumping stations (blocks 4 and 5), which is the combination between hydraulic head {{in the beginning of}} the secondary network and pipe size along that network, which allows the best ratio between investment costs and maintenance costs, and determine the lowest total present costs, or a close value, for the assumed life span of the project, assuring a pre-determined pressure on the hydrants. It was concluded that the distribution in <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> has lower investment and annual maintenance costs and also presents lower annual energy consumption. A sensitivity analysis to what farmers pay for energy annually showed that if they pay 2. 2 times what the managing entity pays, the total present costs for the assumed life span of the project are lower for high pressure distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{compare the}} apical {{negative}} <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation</b> (ANP) with conventional irrigation {{in the teeth}} of immature dogs with apical periodontitis. Methods: Fifty-two immature pre-molar root canals were randomly assigned into 4 groups: ANP (n= 15); conventional irrigation (n= 17); healthy teeth (control) (n = 10); and teeth with untreated apical periodontitis (control) (n= 10). After induction of apical periodontitis, teeth were instrumented using EndoVac® (apical negative <b>pressure</b> <b>irrigation)</b> or conventional irrigation. The animals were euthanized after 90 days. The sections were stained by HE and analyzed under conventional and fluorescence microscopy. TRAP histoenzymology was also performed. Statistical analyses were performed with the significance level set at 5 %. Results: There was difference in the histopathological parameters between ANP and conventional groups (p 0. 05). However, a lower number of osteoclasts was observed in the ANP group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The EndoVac® <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> presented better biological results and more advanced repair process in immature teeth with apical periodontitis than the conventional <b>irrigation</b> <b>system,</b> confirming the hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Growing water scarcity, due {{to growing}} populations and varying natural conditions, puts <b>pressure</b> on <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> which often {{are the main}} consumptive water users. Therefore, water {{resources}} management to improve the allocation of limited water supplies is essential. In this study, a non-linear programming optimization model with an integrated soil/water balance is developed to determine the optimal reservoir release policies and the optimal cropping pattern around Doroudzan Dam in the South-West of Iran. The proposed model was solved using a genetic algorithm (GA). Four weather conditions were identified by combining the probability levels of rainfall, evapotranspiration and inflow. Moreover, two irrigation strategies, full irrigation and deficit irrigation were modeled under each weather condition. The results indicate that for all weather conditions the total farm income and the total cropped area under deficit irrigation were larger than those under full irrigation. In addition, our results show that when the weather conditions {{and the availability of}} water changes the optimal area under corn and sugar beet decreases sharply. In contrast, the change in area cropped with wheat is small. It is concluded that the optimization approach has been successfully applied to Doroudzan Dam region. Thus, decision makers and water authorities can use it as an effective tool for such large and complex irrigation planning problems...|$|R
40|$|Grass {{establishment}} on railway embankment {{steep slopes}} for erosion control in Central Queensland, Australia, is aided by drip lateral <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The effective field {{values of the}} lateral parameters may {{be different from the}} manufacturer supplied ones due to manufacturing variations of the emitters, environmental factors, and water quality. This paper has provided a methodology for estimating drip lateral effective parameter values under field conditions. The hydraulic model takes into account the velocity head change and a proper selection of the friction coefficient formula based on the Reynolds number. Fittings and emitter insertion head losses were incorporated into the hydraulic model. Pressure measurements at some locations within the <b>irrigation</b> <b>system,</b> and the inlet discharges, were used to calibrate the lateral parameters in a statistical framework that allows estimation of parameter uncertainties using the Metropolis algorithm. It is observed that the manufacturer's supplied parameters were significantly different from the calibrated ones, underestimating <b>pressures</b> within the <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> for a given inlet discharge, stressing the need for field testing. The parameter posterior distributions were found to be unimodal and nearly normally distributed. The emitter head loss coefficient distribution being very significant suggests the need to incorporate it into the hydraulic modeling. Although the example given in this paper relates to steep slopes, the methodologies are general and can be applied to any use of drip laterals...|$|R

Two potential ways to reduce these investment costs are keeping the system intact for many years by burying it so the components do not need annual replacement and reducing the initial investment in tubing by placing tubing between two rows so that one lateral supplies water to both rows.

40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} {{assessments of}} consumptive water use (CWU) {{are still at}} an early stage, and partitioning of CWU has rarely been studied on large scales. In this article, CWU is assessed for China's cropland with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-minutes. The partitioning of CWU is discussed through the simulation of transpiration ratios. The total CWU for Chinese cropland was 839 km 3 /a during 1998 - 2002. Spatial distribution of CWU {{is closely related to}} cropland area and crop production with the highest CWU in the North China Plain. Transpiration accounts for two-thirds of CWU. The transpiration ratio is affected by precipitation and irrigation. Transpiration ratios are higher in irrigated systems than in rainfed systems when precipitation is low. Competition of water use will impose <b>pressure</b> on China's <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> in the near future, and it will have a far-reaching effect on the partitioning of consumptive water use.
