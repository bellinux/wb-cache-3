40|$|In Victoria, {{increasing}} the amount of reliable information on the genetic merit of Merino studs is important in reducing the risk faced by wool producers when they introduce new sources of genetic material into their flocks. The Merinos to Match project is a set of <b>linked</b> <b>stud</b> comparisons across Victoria designed to quickly lift the availability of reliable genetic information on Merino studs commonly used in the state. Details of the objectives, background, design, implementation and stakeholder involvement in the project are outlined in the paper. To date, 4 sites have been established in different wool growing areas of Victoria, evaluating 29 studs from 4 states...|$|R

Amongst them Meepo's wife appeared conspicuous from the large necklaces* [The lumps of amber forming these (called [...] "Poshea") were larger than the fist: they are procured in East Tibet, probably from Birmah.] and amulets, corals, and silver filagree work, with which her neck and shoulders were loaded: she wore on her head a red tiara ("Patuk") bedizened with seed pearls and large turquoises, and a gold fillet of filagree bosses united by a web of slender chains; her long tails were elaborately plaited, and woven with beads, and her cloak hooked in front by a chain of broad silver <b>links</b> <b>studded</b> with turquoises. White silk scarfs, the emblem of peace and friendship, were thrown over our hands by each party; and rice, eggs, fowls, kids, goats, and Murwa beer, poured in apace, to the great delight of our servants.|$|R

The long shining counter, the trim red-stained shelves, the glittering cases, the racks of flaunting ties, were beautiful to him and beckoning. He revolved a pleasantly clicking rack of ties, then turned and fought his way out.|$|R
40|$|Six strand ropes {{generate}} torque under tension. This {{can lead}} to transfer of twist to other mooring line components, either permanently, or dynamically. The effects of this imposed twist can seriously affect strength and fatigue endurance. In order to predict the torsional interactions between components {{it is necessary to}} quantify the tension/torsion behavior of all the different categories of mooring line component, not just the six strand rope. This paper discusses the problems of torsional interaction and presents results of measurements of tension/torsion behavior of six strand rope, <b>stud</b> <b>link</b> chain and a PET fiber rope...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{penetration}} around {{windows and}} doors {{is a problem with}} serious consequences for stud walls and is a common problem regardless of facade systems. The problem has received considerable focus in recent times, as buildings using ETICS (External thermal insulation composite systems) on stud walls have been damaged by penetrating water. In the present paper a robust moisture safe prefabricated window connection for stud walls is proposed. The connector is a device which is <b>linking</b> the facade, <b>stud</b> wall and window and facilitates water sealing. As a result a prototype has been developed and tested in accordance with standard practice. The new window connection is easy to be mounted and is suitable for facades consisting of ETICS, wood paneling or sheet materials and makes it possible to install the window after the facade is complete...|$|R
40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how mooring chains work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on mooring chains. Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common chain link designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study chain links as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in chain links are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in chain links. The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. Mooring components as chain links enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of mooring chains does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the crown section. Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|R

Now, do I {{remember}} that in her most caressing love, there ever gleamed some scaly, glittering folds of pride. Me she loveth with pride's love; in me she thinks she seeth her own curled and haughty beauty; before my glass she stands,--pride's priestess--and to her mirrored image, not to me, she offers up her offerings of kisses. Oh, small thanks I owe thee, Favorable Goddess, that didst clothe this form with all {{the beauty of a}} man, that so thou mightest hide from me all the truth of a man. Now I see that in his beauty a man is snared, and made stone-blind, as the worm within its silk. Welcome then be Ugliness and Poverty and Infamy, and all ye other crafty ministers of Truth, that beneath the hoods and rags of beggars hide yet the belts and crowns of kings. And dimmed be all beauty that must own the clay; and dimmed be all wealth, and all delight, and all the annual prosperities of earth, that but gild the <b>links,</b> and <b>stud</b> with diamonds the base rivets and the chains of Lies. Oh, now methinks I a little see why of old the men of Truth went barefoot, girded with a rope, and ever moving under mournfulness as underneath a canopy. I remember now those first wise words, wherewith our Savior Christ first spoke in his first speech to men:--'Blessed are the poor in spirit, and blessed they that mourn.' Oh, hitherto I have but piled up words; bought books, and bought some small experiences, and builded me in libraries; now I sit down and read. Oh, now I know the night, and comprehend the sorceries of the moon, and all the dark persuadings that have their birth in storms and winds. Oh, not long will Joy abide, when Truth doth come; nor Grief her laggard be. Well may this head hang on my breast--it holds too much; well may my heart knock at my ribs,--prisoner impatient of his iron bars. Oh, men are jailers all; jailers of themselves; and in Opinion's world ignorantly hold their noblest part a captive to their vilest; as disguised royal Charles when caught by peasants.

5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and <b>Stud</b> <b>Link</b> Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The study {{involved}} a detail empirical {{investigation into the}} different road studs in use on South Africa’s national road network and how they performed on the network under different road conditions {{in order to establish}} which road stud, under what conditions, offers best value for money in terms of life-cycle cost for the South African National Roads Agency Limited. These main questions were asked: What is the most cost-effective/value-for-money stud option for SANRAL to choose for each of the specified road categories? Under which conditions do the studs perform differently and what is the most likely mode of failure of specific <b>studs</b> <b>linked</b> to a specific road condition and road category? The South African and Australian road stud standards were reviewed to gain understanding of which criteria one has to consider when evaluating road studs and what information would be needed for the research. Similar studies on road studs were reviewed to compare the criteria that were looked at, namely Guidelines for the use of Raised Pavement Markers, developed by the Department of Transport in the United States, and Feasibility of using accelerated pavement testing to evaluate the long term performance of raised pavement markers, a research paper by the Florida Department of Transport. This research made use of a standardised questionnaire containing questions on various elements found to be key to the road stud performance. The study was done on approximately 4 659 km of roads in SANRAL’s Western region, consisting of the Western Cape and Northern Cape. From the literature review, it was identified {{that there is a need}} for the SABS standards to be updated to include the testing of structural properties of studs. SANRAL should look at the lack in specification requirements when asking for the installation of road studs. From the data available it was observed that the preferred studs were the Ferro Lynx followed by the STA+ 52 stud. They are predominantly used on the roads that were included in the survey. They perform well on the national roads. The data suggests that these two studs and the Rhino stud are the best-performing studs with the least dislodgement and loss in reflectivity. The STA+ 52 and Rhino stud, however, are fairly new on the market and more data for theirs full life cycle should be obtained for further monitoring The regression analysis indicated that 36 per cent of the variation in the reflectivity of the Ferro Lynx stud can be explained by the surface width of the road, the traffic volume measured as ELVS and the period installed. All the coefficients were significant with a 5 per cent significance. The prediction tables on the weighted data set, indicated that one should always consider width of road when choosing a road stud and that the reflectivity of studs deteriorates most on the narrower roads...|$|R
