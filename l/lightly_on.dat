5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A.P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E

25|$|Soja is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} Baccara formula—consisting of breathy lyrics, lush backing, a disco beat and the striking image of two women (Mateos dressed in black, Mendiola in white) dancing. While drawing <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> Spanish flamenco song and dance tradition, the formula was very much rooted in 1970s disco music. Soja's song arrangements generally used Mateos as the lead singer while Mendiola contributed backing and refrains.|$|E
25|$|An {{object in}} motion that {{moves out of}} its natural arc for no {{apparent}} reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> the paper for reference, to be erased later.|$|E
25|$|The weapons {{used are}} also in debate. As {{mentioned}} above, some claim Gonnosuke was using a long staff (bo) reinforced with metal rings. Other versions claim he used an exceptionally long wooden sword which was above {{the average length of}} a Japanese sword over four shaku 1 long, (roughly 121cm or 48 inches), instead of the normal length bokuto of around 2.45 Shaku (roughly 74cm or 29 inches). Musashi's weapon of choice is also debated. One version say he was armed with only a half-finished bokuto, which Musashi was actually still carving as the duel began, and used it to overwhelm Gonnosuke without ever using the X-shaped block, instead hitting him <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> the forehead as to demonstrate his superior stance in battle and emphasizing proper distance to an opponent, or Maai.|$|E

It’s very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said “no,” silence certainly does not equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst."

2500|$|Pinot Meunier can be {{identified}} by ampelographers by its indented leaves that appear downy white, like flour has been dusted liberally on the underside, and <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> the upper side, of the leaf. The name [...] "Meunier" [...] comes from the French word for miller {{with many of the}} grapevine's synonyms (see below) also hearkening to this association-such as [...] "Dusty Miller" [...] which is used in England, [...] "Farineaux" [...] and [...] "Noirin Enfariné" [...] used in France as well as [...] "Müllerrebe" [...] and [...] "Müller-Traube" [...] used in Germany. This characteristic derives from large numbers of fine white hairs on the leaves. However, some clones of Pinot Meunier {{have been found to be}} completely hairless—a chimeric mutation, in fact—which has led ampelographers to more closely draw a link between Meunier and Pinot noir.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pamphlet}} [...] "Why Freegan?"—written {{by former}} Against Me! drummer Warren Oakes in Gainesville, Florida in 1999—defines freeganism as [...] "an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating" [...] {{and goes on}} to describe practices including dumpster diving, plate scraping, wild foraging, gardening, theft, employee scams, and barter as alternatives to paying for food. The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with [...] "freeganism" [...] with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including conserving water, pre-cycling, reusing goods, and using solar energy. More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an [...] "ultimate boycott" [...] of [...] "all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the capitalist system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito" [...] in favor of [...] "liv a full satisfying life...while treading <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> the earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In its North American years, as its celebrity grew, the quartet's members {{naturally}} {{associated with}} notable musicians such as Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Mischa Elman, and—not surprisingly, given the quartet’s Belgian connections—Eugène Ysaÿe. The group also, however, had less obvious associations {{with the famous}} of its day. In one colorful incident, as the quartet toured during the 1916–1917 season, it crossed paths with the famous deafblind author, activist, and lecturer Helen Keller and her teacher and companion Anne Sullivan in Oklahoma City, where Keller was scheduled for a lecture. Keller proposed as an experiment that the quartet should play for her, to determine whether she could sense music; readily acceding to her request, the quartet played music including the celebrated second movement, andante cantabile, from Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet no. 1 in D Major, op. 11, as she held her fingertips <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> a resonant tabletop. Keller quickly sensed the musical vibrations, swaying in time, alternately crying and smiling. Afterward, Keller reacted as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The ECoG {{recording}} {{is performed}} from electrodes {{placed on the}} exposed cortex. [...] In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing {{a part of the}} skull to expose the brain surface. [...] This procedure may be performed either under general anesthesia or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping. [...] Electrodes are then surgically implanted {{on the surface of the}} cortex, with placement guided by the results of preoperative EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [...] Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). [...] ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, Platinum-iridium alloy or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and socket joint for ease in positioning. [...] These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration. Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256 electrode contacts. [...] The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact. [...] Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1cm; individual electrodes are typically 5mm in diameter. [...] The electrodes sit <b>lightly</b> <b>on</b> the cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury. [...] A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy. [...] Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired. [...] Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the hippocampus.|$|E
