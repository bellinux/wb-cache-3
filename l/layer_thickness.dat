The surface structure, texture, and {{extended}} defects were analyzed for films with different MgO <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> A roof-tile structure was only observed for films with <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses</b> exceeding 800 nm. MgO facet widths and amplitudes were determined for different MgO buffer <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> At 800 nm the facets height was 18 nm and the facet width was 71 nm. The corresponding values measured for a 5 μm thick MgO film were 64 nm and 234 nm, respectively. For <b>layers</b> with <b>layer</b> <b>thicknesses</b> smaller than 200 nm the films were polycrystalline {{with a grain}} size of 20 nm.

25|$|This {{dependence}} is crucial, as {{twice as}} much silicon is being consumed at higher temperatures. The deposition occurs selectively on pure Si only, but not on silicon oxide or nitride, thus the reaction is highly sensitive to contamination or substrate pre-treatment. The decomposition reaction is fast, but saturates when the tungsten <b>layer</b> <b>thickness</b> reaches 10–15 micrometers. The saturation occurs because the tungsten layer stops diffusion of WF6 molecules to the Si substrate {{which is the only}} catalyst of molecular decomposition in this process.|$|E
