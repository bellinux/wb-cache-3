40|$|Research {{regarding}} the habitat {{use of the}} neotropical river otter (<b>Lontra</b> <b>longicaudis)</b> is lacking. <b>I</b> assessed habitat use by the species in the San Pedro River of northern México using presence/absence (i. e., detection/non‐detection) data from 21 used and 25 randomly‐selected unused sites. The best fitting logistic regression models and principal component ordination reveal that river otters prefer habitat patches dominated by large, deep pools with nearby talus/rock cover and densely vegetated riverbanks. I mention the importance of understanding habitat use patterns for river otter ecology and conservation and the usefulness of presence/absence data in population ecology and conservation planning research...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} 96 museum specimens {{belonging to}} 14 species of Carnivora from the Mexican State of Puebla.

Eight of these 23 taxa are reported herein {{for the first}} time from the state of Puebla. Of the 18 species, Herpailurus yagouaroundi, <b>Lontra</b> <b>longicaudis,</b> Taxidea taxus, and Galictis vittata are considered by Norma Oficial Mexicana as threatened species, Leopardus wiedii and Eira barbara in danger of extinction, and Potos flavus is under special protection. We found Lynx rufus, Canis latrans, Taxidea taxus, and Bassariscus astutus were found only in the Nearctic region of the State, whereas Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Leopardus wiedii, <b>Lontra</b> <b>longicaudis,</b> Galictis vittata, Eira barbara, Potos flavus, and Nasua narica were found only in the Neotropical region of the State. The remaining seven species (Puma concolor, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, Mustela frenata, Mephitis macroura, Spilogale putorius, Conepatus leuconotus, and Procyon lotor) have been taken in both the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Localities in the Sierra Norte de Puebla had the greatest species richness and abundance of individuals. The carnivores confront serious conservation problems in the state because they are hunted indiscriminately as trophies and by the local residents as harmful species. Moreover they are hunted for economic benefit by the sale of theirs skins or as living pets.

40|$|The current {{distribution}} {{and status of}} <b>Lontra</b> <b>longicaudis</b> annectens on the Southern slope of the Venezuelan Andes was established by carrying out interviews with local people.

The species was recorded on 23 of these rivers, and a clear decreasing trend in the species' population was detected. Based on these results, the main threats for the species appear to be reduction of their natural habitat and the contamination of watercourses, with illegal poaching of secondary importance. It is suggested that more detailed studies are carried out to quantify species' abundance, identify more precisely the potential factors determining population decrease, and detect optimal sites for its protection...|$|R
