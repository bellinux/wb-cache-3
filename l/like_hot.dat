Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets <b>like</b> <b>Hot</b> Topic. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.|$|E
25|$|Vélez {{began her}} career as a {{performer}} in Mexican vaudeville in the early 1920s. After moving to the United States, she made her first film appearance in a short film in 1927. By the end of the decade, {{in the last years of}} American silent films, she had progressed to leading roles in numerous movies like The Gaucho (1927), Lady of the Pavements (1928) and Wolf Song (1929), among others. She was one of the first successful Latin American actresses in the United States. During the 1930s, her well-known explosive screen persona was exploited in a series of successful films <b>like</b> <b>Hot</b> Pepper (1933), Strictly Dynamite (1934) and Hollywood Party (1934). In the 1940s, Vélez's popularity peaked after appearing in the Mexican Spitfire films, a series created to capitalize on Vélez's well-documented fiery personality.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the {{influence}} of American and Swedish death metal bands was quickly evident. Many of the thrash bands of the 1980s had disbanded and heavier groups were beginning to fill the void, such as Necrotomy, Acheron, Disembowlment, Corpse Molestation, Damnatory, Hecatomb, Damaged, Anatomy and Blood Duster in Melbourne, Dreamkillers, Obfuscate Mass, Misery and Mausoleum in Brisbane, Aftermath, Apostasy and Cruciform from Sydney and Psychrist and Alchemist from Canberra. Perhaps due to magazines <b>like</b> <b>Hot</b> Metal and the occasional exposure to extreme metal on some community radio programs, bands like these were appearing at a high rate. Shock Records, the Melbourne independent label, commissioned a compilation album to highlight some of these new acts. Come to Daddy was released in 1992 and compiled by Hot Metal writer Ian McFarlane; it contained 14 tracks from bands like Necrotomy, Mausoleum, Mystic Insight, Deracination, Obfuscate Mass, Misery, Discarnated, Entasis, iNFeCTeD, Open Festering Wounds, and Persecution. When McFarlane went to Roadrunner Records' Australian office the following year, he put together another compilation, Redrum, collecting tracks from another group of completely different bands like Alchemist, Sadistik Exekution, Frozen Doberman, Allegiance and Hecatomb.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the show}} were often favorable, noting it was fun {{entertainment}} for the family. After Double Dare premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the Chicago Tribune, observed that when contestants [...] "squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious," [...] and said, [...] "Double Dare is so refreshing." [...] Noel Holston of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune wrote that [...] "kids and game shows, {{when you think about}} it, go together <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> fudge and ice cream". The Orange County Registers Ellen T. Klein said Double Dare is [...] "such fast-paced, furious and messy fun" [...] and rated the show as [...] "good". In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as [...] "the not-so-secret ingredients in the show's success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers".|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Tony Tyler {{began his}} review {{by stating that}} he had long idolised Harrison as [...] "the finest {{packaged}} object since frozen pizza", but he had changed his opinion dramatically in recent years; after the [...] "dire, ennui-making" [...] All Things Must Pass, Tyler continued, [...] "the unworthiness of my heretical thoughts smote home {{around the time of}} the Bangla Desh concerts." [...] Tyler dismissed Material World with the description: [...] " [...] pleasant, competent, vaguely dull and inoffensive. It’s also breathtakingly unoriginal and – lyrically at least – turgid, repetitive and so damn holy I could scream." [...] The reviewer concluded: [...] "I have no doubt whatever it'll sell <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> tracts and that George'll donate all the profits to starving Bengalis and make me feel like the cynical heel I undoubtedly am." [...] In their 1975 book , Tyler and co-author Roy Carr bemoaned Harrison's [...] "didactically imposing [...] said Holy Memoirs upon innocent record-collectors" [...] and declared the album's spiritual theme [...] "almost as offensive in its own way" [...] as Lennon and Yoko Ono's political radicalism on Some Time in New York City (1972).|$|E
500|$|In the United States, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart {{at number}} 35, {{for the week}} of July 4, 1992. The debut was aided by just airplay points which enabled it to enter the Hot 100 Airplay chart at number 14. The song {{received}} immediate heavy rotation in US radio stations <b>like</b> <b>Hot</b> 97 in New York and Wild 107 in San Francisco. One week later, the song jumped to number 17 on the Hot 100, having had the largest sales and airplay points of any record on the chart. On August 8, 1992, the song {{reached the top of}} the chart for one week, becoming Madonna's tenth number one single, breaking her tie with Whitney Houston as the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. The song replaced [...] "Baby Got Back" [...] by Sir Mix-a-Lot although it was number three on the Hot Singles Sales and Hot 100 Airplay charts. According to Michael Ellis from Billboard, the song edged out [...] "Baby Got Back" [...] by a small margin of chart points. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart and ranked at number 21 on the Hot 100 year end chart for 1992.|$|E

500|$|The JAMs' promotional tactics were {{similarly}} unconventional, {{including the use}} of promotional graffiti, a guerrilla communication method employed repeatedly by Drummond and Cauty, beginning around the time of their first releases. [...] Some copies of the re-released single were supplied in a picture sleeve which showed The JAMs' [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] graffiti defacing a billboard (advertising the Today newspaper) that depicted police chief James Anderton. [...] Anderton, a self-declared Christian, had courted controversy when he said [...] "I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making… We must ask why homosexuals freely engage in sodomy and other obnoxious practices, knowing the dangers involved" [...] As with much of The JAMs' graffiti, the potency of [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] was derived from the context it in which it was placed. [...] Further graffiti followed, [...] "JAMs" [...] and [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] slogans defacing billboards and Government-funded AIDS warnings in London. [...] The JAMs also made available [...] "Shag Shag Shag" [...] T-shirts which King Boy D told the NME were [...] "selling <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> cakes".

2500|$|Suddenly, {{without the}} {{slightest}} warning, the bolt was torn from our hands, and the mass of heavy metal shot across the deck like the shell from a gun. [...] The trajectory was almost straight, and the brass bolt hurtled into the steel winch thirty feet away across the deck and sheared a half-inch notch gouged out by the harder metal. [...] This {{was followed by a}} solid cylinder of water, which slackened after a while into a cataract, pouring out the hole in the door, some air mingled with the water, looking <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> steam, instead of compressed air shooting through ice-cold water.|$|E
2500|$|Oophorectomy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. [...] A potential risk for oophorectomy performed after menopause is not fully elucidated. [...] Reduced levels of testosterone in women is predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density. [...] In women under the age of 50 who have undergone oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often used to offset the negative effects of sudden hormonal loss such as early-onset osteoporosis as well as menopausal problems <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> flushes that are usually more severe than those experienced by women undergoing natural menopause.|$|E
2500|$|Olive trees show {{a marked}} {{preference}} for calcareous soils, flourishing best on limestone slopes and crags, and coastal climate conditions.

Olives <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> weather and sunny positions without any shade, while temperatures below [...] may injure even a mature tree. They tolerate drought well, {{due to their}} sturdy and extensive root systems. Olive trees can live for several centuries and can remain productive for as long if they are pruned correctly and regularly.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{only about}} a month after Wyman and Brockway, the British folklorists Cecil Sharp and Maud Karpeles toured the Southern Appalachian region, visiting places <b>like</b> <b>Hot</b> Springs in North Carolina, Flag Pond in Tennessee, Harlan in Kentucky, and Greenbrier County in West Virginia, as well as schools such as Berea College and the Hindman Settlement School in Kentucky and the Pi Beta Phi {{settlement}} school in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

After their first study in Appalachia, Sharp and Karpeles published English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{performance}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] has influenced numerous artists to incorporate a similar routine during live shows. An anecdote stated [...] "Her {{performance of}} this song, when she brought a fan on {{stage for a}} strip tease during The Velvet Rope Tour has been co-opted {{by the likes of}} Britney Spears and Rihanna in later years." [...] Other artists observed to be inspired by the rendition include Pink, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera, the Sugababes, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, and Chris Brown. Nicole Brown of Vibe stated [...] "Long before Rihanna and Nicki were handing out lap dances <b>like</b> <b>hot</b> cakes, Miss Jackson revolutionized dirty dancing with her [...] "Rope Burn" [...] routine in 1998. Janet works her way up and down a pole before laying a passionate kiss on an excited male fan." [...] A critique of Chris Brown's Fan Appreciation Tour remarked [...] "Brown isn’t the only celeb getting freaky on stage with their fans, singer Janet Jackson {{was one of the first}} celebrities to get freaky with fans on a stage in front of thousands of on-lookers." [...] Katy Perry was also thought to emulate the performance on the California Dreams Tour, in which she brought a male onstage and [...] "teasingly traced a finger down his bare chest and stomach." [...] The Guardian observed influence from Jackson in the Sugababes' performance of [...] "Virgin Sexy" [...] on the Angels with Dirty Faces Tour, [...] "in which they lapdance around the sole member of the audience who is male and in his twenties", adding [...] "It's a trick Janet Jackson did a few years ago, on her Velvet Rope tour." [...] In 2013, Wall Street International reported the performance inspired American artist (who was exhibiting I London at the time), Alex Da Corte's painting [...] "Velveteen (Wilson Kelvin McQuade)", offering the analogy [...] "a lap dance performed by one artwork for another may be crass, yet too fitting to be ignored." ...|$|E
