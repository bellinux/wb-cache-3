40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the structure and stability of vortices in spin- 1 atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) in rotating, optical traps. We numerically study these vortex structures using a classical mean-field theory which allows atomic interactions to change the local expectation value of the atomic spin. Initially applying a model in which the atoms interact only via scattering which does not conserve an initial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation,</b> we identify the energetically stable configurations of singular and nonsingular vortices via propagation in imaginary time in a rotating frame of reference. We find that the cores of singular vortices fill with atoms in the spinor BEC and show that this can be understood in terms of an energetic hierarchy of length scales. By refining the numerical model to explicitly conserve <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation,</b> we show that the conservation of a strong magnetisation can lead to a mixing of the two phases of the ground-state manifold (polar and ferromagnetic), which are characterised by the expectation value of the spin. This occurs {{as a result of the}} introduction of a new characteristic length scale determined by the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation.</b> A surprising consequence is the stability of a ferromagnetic coreless vortex in the polar interaction regime, which otherwise is energetically unstable. We construct analytic spinor wavefunctions which parametrise the interpolation between the polar and ferromagnetic phases, exhibiting different vortex topologies in the respective phases. Finally by identifying stationary states of the system, we show how nonlocal dipoledipole interactions between atoms introduces an additional length scale determined by the strength of the dipolar interaction. The energetic hierarchy of length scales then determines whether the dipolar interactions have a significant effect on the stationary vortex structures. In particular we show how a BEC with polar interactions adopts the properties of a ferromagnetic condensate when the dipolar interactions dominate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{equations}} {{that describe}} the time-evolution of transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> 15 N <b>magnetisations</b> in tetrahedral ammonium ions, 15 NH 4 +, {{are derived from}} the Bloch-Wangsness-Redfield density operator relaxation theory. It is assumed that the relaxation of the spin-states is dominated by (1) the intra-molecular 15 N– 1 H and 1 H– 1 H dipole–dipole interactions and (2) interactions of the ammonium protons with remote spins, which also include the contribution to the relaxations that arise from the exchange of the ammonium protons with the bulk solvent. The dipole–dipole cross-correlated relaxation mechanisms between each of the 15 N– 1 H and 1 H– 1 H interactions are explicitly {{taken into account in}} the derivations. An application to 15 N-ammonium bound to a 41 kDa domain of the protein DnaK is presented, where a comparison between experiments and simulations show that the ammonium ion rotates rapidly within its binding site with a local correlation time shorter than approximately 1 ns. The theoretical framework provided here forms the basis for further investigations of dynamics of AX 4 spin systems, with ammonium ions in solution and bound to proteins of particular interest...|$|R
40|$|The general aims of {{the work}} in this thesis are to locate and {{quantify}} magnetic dipoles using a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system based on Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors, and to generate various target magnetic fields using magnetic dipoles. MEG provides direct, real-time measurements of magnetic fields at sub-millisecond temporal resolution and femtoTesla sensitivity. It is typically used to describe sources in terms of current dipoles, but here we adapt a different approach and use it to characterise magnetic dipoles. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we describe initial experiments which were carried out in order to demonstrate the feasibility of using the high sensitivity of MEG SQUID sensors to detect extremely small magnetic field shifts due to magnetised samples, and to then locate and quantify the magnetic dipoles. We show that a standard MEG system can be used to measure magnetic field shifts due to susceptibility effects from samples exposed to an Ultra Low Field (ULF), as well as to detect and image the distribution of decaying <b>longitudinal</b> nuclear <b>magnetisation</b> from pre-polarised samples. During our experiments, we also identified a long-lived magnetisation in biological samples, whose magnetisation orientation is fixed by the sample orientation. This finding led us to carry out experiments on samples including human tissue (the hand, wrist, and foot) using MEG, and to characterise the magnetisation behaviour. Even though ULF Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has several benefits, it is difficult for it to compete with Ultra High Field (UHF) MRI since the higher the field is, the larger does the SNR tend to be. Yet, higher fields increase the effects of intrinsic magnetic susceptibility differences, which in turn leads to field inhomogeneities. Thus, in the second part of this thesis, we aim at improving the quality of high field MR images. We show how magnetic dipoles can be used to generate different target fields that can be used to shim different inhomogeneous magnetic fields at UHF. These magnetic dipoles can be realised using either an array of orthogonal coils or pieces of strongly diamagnetic material...|$|R

30|$|Arterial spin {{labeling}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (ASL-MRI) has been widely recognised as a valuable method for non-invasive assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) [1 – 4]. Similar to 15 O-water positron emission tomography (PET), the method {{is based on the}} assumption of free (or at least very high) diffusibility of water between blood and tissue. In contrast to PET, however, the relevant time scales for the measurement are much shorter (of the order of a few seconds) due to the rapid free decay of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation</b> of magnetically tagged water. At the same time, the temporal resolution is much higher than in PET. For these reasons, it is not clear to what extent the simple Kety-Schmidt model [5, 6] suffices for reliable perfusion quantitation with ASL. Several refinements and modifications of the basic model have been proposed in the literature [7 – 9].|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{connection}} between the cumulants of a time-integrated observable of a quantum system and the PT-symmetry properties of the non-Hermitian deformation of the Hamiltonian from which the generating function of these cumulants is obtained. This non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can display regimes of broken and of unbroken PT-symmetry, depending on the parameters of the problem and on the counting field that sets the strength of the non-Hermitian perturbation. This in turn determines the analytic structure of the long-time cumulant generating function (CGF) for the time-integrated observable. We consider in particular the case of the time-integrated (<b>longitudinal)</b> <b>magnetisation</b> in the one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse field. We show that its long-time CGF is singular on a curve in the magnetic field/counting field plane that delimits a regime where PT-symmetry is spontaneously broken (which includes the static ferromagnetic phase), from one where it is preserved (which includes the static paramagnetic phase). In the paramagnetic phase, conservation of PT -symmetry implies that all cumulants are sub-linear in time, a behaviour usually associated to the absence of decorrelation...|$|E

The cervical cords of 13 healthy volunteers were scanned at 3 T using a protocol optimised for multi-parameter mapping. Intra-subject co-registration was performed using linear registration, and tissue- and column-specific parameter values were calculated. Cervical cord parameter values measured from levels C 1 -C 5 in 13 subjects are: apparent proton density, 4822 ± 718 a. u.; MT ratio, 40. 4 ± 1. 53 p. u.; MT saturation, 1. 40 ± 0. 12 p. u.; T 1 = 1848 ± 143 ms; R 2 * = 22. 6 ± 1. 53 s(- 1). Inter-subject coefficients of variation were low in both the cervical cord and tissue- and column-specific measurements, illustrating the potential of this method for the investigation of changes in these parameters caused by pathology. In summary, an optimised cervical cord multi-parameter mapping protocol was developed, enabling tissue- and column-specific measurements to be made. This technique has the potential to provide insight into the pathological processes occurring in the cervical cord affected by neurological disorders...|$|E

We assessed the transferability of a T 1 mapping method and determined the reference values of healthy human myocardium in a multicenter setting. METHODS:Healthy subjects (n = 102; mean age 41 years (range 17 - 83), male, n = 53 (52 %)), with no previous medical history, and normotensive low risk subjects (n= 113) referred for clinical cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) were examined. Further inclusion criteria for all were absence of regular medication and subsequently normal findings of routine CMR. All subjects underwent T 1 mapping using a uniform imaging set-up (modified Look- Locker inversion recovery, MOLLI, using scheme 3 (3) 3 (3) 5)) on 1. 5 Tesla (T) and 3 T Philips scanners. Native T 1 -maps were acquired in a single midventricular short axis slice and repeated 20 minutes following gadobutrol. Reference values were obtained for native T 1 and gadolinium-based partition coefficients, lambda and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) in a core lab using standardized postprocessing. RESULTS:In healthy controls, mean native T 1 values were 950 +/- 21 msec at 1. 5 T and 1052 +/- 23 at 3 T. lambda and ECV values were 0. 44 +/- 0. 06 and 0. 25 +/- 0. 04 at 1. 5 T, and 0. 44 +/- 0. 07 and 0. 26 +/- 0. 04 at 3 T, respectively. There {{were no significant differences}} between healthy controls and low risk subjects in routine CMR parameters and T 1 values. The entire cohort showed no correlation between age, gender and native T 1. Cross-center comparisons of mean values showed no significant difference for any of the T 1 indices at any field strength. There were considerable regional differences in segmental T 1 values. lambda and ECV were found to be dose dependent. There was excellent inter- and intraobserver reproducibility for measurement of native septal T 1. CONCLUSION:We show transferability for a unifying T 1 mapping methodology in a multicenter setting.

40|$|An {{important}} {{objective of}} polymer science {{is to establish}} relationships between the microscopic structure or molecular dynamics and the macroscopic properties of materials. Once established, this knowledge then allows the design polymers with improved properties. A new method called AIMS (Accordion Magic Sandwich), which scan the dipolar magic echo shape with the Hahn echo, was developed. Using this method the residual second and fourth van Vleek moments, which are more sensitive to cross-link density, were measured, model free, without the interference originated from static and radiofrequency magnetic fields, or local susceptibility. The mixed echo decays, which are characterized by 1 H residual second van Vleck moment, multispin dipolar correlation time or parameters of the correlation time distribution, were measured {{for a series of}} natural rubber samples with different cross-link densities. The measured segmental order was shown to scale with a polynomial dependence on cross-link density or shear modulus. A Maxwell-Boltzmann type of the distribution function of the end-to-end vector can characterized better the orientation of the polymer chains into a polymer network. The effect of stress and orientation of the stressed elastomers in static magnetic fields on the proton second van Vleek moment was studied using the mixed echo and multipolar spin states. Theoretically and experimental was demonstrates the possibility to obtain an enhanced sensitivity to the change in the values of residual dipolar couplings by measuring high order multiple quantum coherences. By an ingenious combination of high resolution magic angle sample spinning with the 2 D double-quantum filtered spectroscopy and the chemical shift filter the magnetisation exchange process between different functional groups was evidentiated and characterized. The measurement of the self-diffusion coefficient of small penetrant molecules was used as a new tool to determine the polymer networks deformation under stress or compression. The global anisotropy of the collagen fibril orientation in Achilles tendon, evidentiated in the measurement of 1 H residual dipolar couplings determined from DQ build-up curves and DQ-filtered doublets as well as dipolar encoded <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation</b> of bounded water interacting with the collagen fibers, was investigated quantitatively, using a Gaussian distribution functions, and a expansion in Legendre polynomials distribution function. Moreover a localized anisotropy was measured using 1 H NMR images of tendons under mechanical load conditions encoded by the residual dipolar couplings of bound water. Two mobile NMR sensors and a series of radiofrequency coils were characterized. For the simulations of the NMR spine system response in the inhomogeneous magnetic field a simulation program was written in C++. The sensitive volumes of two NMR mobile sensors were studied for different experimental condition like the operating frequency and different RF pulses sequences.

40|$|Naval {{submarines}} {{and surface}} ships are regularly {{subjected to a}} treatment called 'deperming' that seeks to design the vessel's permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate {{various aspects of the}} deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A laboratory MTF was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU 200 T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ± 5 %) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU 200 T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ± 0. 1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0. 94 ± 0. 09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA 2 S-E and CU 200 T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>magnetisation</b> (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU 200 T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5. 97 ´ 10 - 3 and 0. 0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D) : redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel 'anhysteretic deperm' method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin's equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. 'Sympathetic deperming' occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (> 0. 1 m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0. 5 mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines...|$|E
