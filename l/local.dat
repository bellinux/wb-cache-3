5|$|Due to Song's {{enormous}} {{population growth}} and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly gentry class would now take over grassroots affairs on the vast <b>local</b> level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, <b>local</b> tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and <b>local</b> elites supervised <b>local</b> affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of <b>local</b> communities; any <b>local</b> magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon {{the cooperation of the}} few or many <b>local</b> gentry in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of the funds for schools was drawn from private financing. This limited role of government officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and <b>local</b> affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of <b>local</b> gentry to perform necessary duties in their communities.|$|E
