5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale.

5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as {{there has always been a}} need to keep crops free from pests.

5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was not so <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
