40|$|<b>Liquid-level</b> <b>indicator,</b> {{consisting}} of a diode heated by a resistor, allows simultaneous use {{of two or three}} of the liquids nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium. Operation depends on strong temperature-dependence of the forward resistance of a germanium diode and the difference between liquid and vapor in heat-transfer properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{self-supported}} 40 W Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) {{system has}} been developed and performance tested. The auxiliaries in the DMFC system comprise a methanol sensor, a <b>liquid-level</b> <b>indicator,</b> and fuel and air pumps that consume a total power of about 5 W. The system has a 15 -cell DMFC stack with active electrode-area of 45 cm(2). The self-supported DMFC system addresses issues related to water recovery from the cathode exhaust, and maintains a constant methanol-feed concentration with thermal management in the system. Pure methanol and water from cathode exhaust are pumped to the methanol-mixing tank where the liquid level is monitored and controlled {{with the help of}} a <b>liquid-level</b> <b>indicator.</b> During the operation, methanol concentration in the feed solution at the stack outlet is monitored using a methanol sensor, and pure methanol is added to restore the desired methanol concentration in the feed tank by adding the product water from the cathode exhaust. The feed-rate requirements of fuel and oxidant are designed for the stack capacity of 40 W. The self-supported DMFC system is ideally suited for various defense and civil applications and, in particular, for charging the storage batteries...|$|E
