By extract atomic patterns of catalytic residues in surface pockets computed geometrically, we develop a library of atomic patterns on protein functional surfaces of ca 700 structures. Together with propensities of secondary structures and residue occurrence in active sites, we develop methods to identify functionally important surfaces on protein structures and to locate key residues.

40|$|Africa {{has a high}} {{concentration}} of sub-regional economic organisations, multilateral arrangements and institutions promoting the goals of integration. Yet, the continent has remained the least integrated of the world’s major regions. Africa has remained slow in its development trajectory and harbours most of the least developed countries of the world. A large percentage of the African populace is mired in poverty while the sub-continent continues to be marginalised in global affairs. The obvious reality is that Africa is yet to benefit fully from the gains of regional economic integration and that the economic transformation of the African continent as a whole – one of the main objectives often declared in establishing regional economic integration schemes – is yet to be realised. There is, in Africa, a seemingly wide gap between the theoretical aspirations towards regional economic integration and the empirical evidence and practical reality of actual integration.

40|$|Policy-makers have {{instituted a}} variety of fuel economy tax {{policies}} – polices that tax or subsidize new vehicle purchases {{on the basis of}} fuel economy performance – in the hopes of improving fleet fuel economy and reducing gasoline consumption. This article reviews existing policies and concludes that while they do work to improve vehicle fuel economy, the same goals could be achieved at a lower cost to society if policy-makers instead directly taxed fuel. Fuel economy taxation, as it is currently practiced, invites several forms of gaming that could be eliminated by policy changes. Thus, even if policy-makers prefer fuel economy taxation over fuel taxes for reasons other than efficiency, there are still potential efficiency gains from reform. 1 Why do we tax fuel economy? In recent decades, the United States government has introduced several “fuel economy taxes” – that is, taxes or subsidies on the purchase of new consumer automobiles that depend on the vehicle’s fuel economy performance. These policies vary in detail.

It targets at finding size and location of human face on digital image, by identifying and separating faces from the surrounding objects like building, plants etc. For the purpose of developing an advanced face recognition algorithm, Detection of facial key points is the basic and very important task, basically it is about finding out the location of specific key points on facial images. This key points can be mouths, noses, left eyes, right eyes and so on. For implementation of solution, I have used amazon ec 2 gpu instance and convolutional networks consisting of multiple levels. Outputs of multiple networks are fused at every level for accurate and robust evaluation. At the stage of initialization, high level features are extracted over the whole face region which helps in <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> points with high accuracy. Local minimum occurred by data corruption and ambiguity in difficult samples of image caused by occlusions, extreme lightings and large variations in poses can be avoided by this method.

The Umatilla River has seven low elevation dams that may obstruct Chinook salmon and steelhead access to historic spawning areas. We used radio telemetry to examine fallback rates, passage routes, rates, and delays, holding and spawning locations, and maximum upstream distribution of Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Umatilla River basin (Oregon). Analyses focused {{on the effects of}} project modifications on salmonid passage and overall system use by fish. Detections at fixed receivers and mobile tracking of 476 tagged steelhead, 130 spring Chinook salmon, and 206 fall Chinook salmon from 2009 - 2012 provided data for these analyses. Recent project modifications at individual diversion structures have resulted in marked improvements in fish passages times. Species show preference for different aspects of the modifications; for example, jump pools are used by spring Chinook more than steelhead. System passage times have also been markedly reduced. <b>Locating</b> <b>key</b> holding and spawning areas will provide information for additional habitat and restoration needs.

40|$|Abstract: Key {{changes are}} common in Western {{classical}} music. The precise segmentation of a music piece at instances where key changes occur allows for further analysis, like self-similarity analysis, chord recognition, and several other techniques that mainly pertain to the characterization of music content. This article examines the automatic segmentation of audio data into parts composed in different keys, using clustering on chroma-related spaces. To this end, the k-means algorithm is used and a methodology is proposed so that useful information about key changes can be derived, regardless {{of the number of}} clusters or key changes. The proposed methodology is evaluated by experimenting on the segmentation of recordings of existing compositions from the Classic-Romantic repertoire. Additional analysis is performed using artificial data sets. Specifically, the construction of artificial pieces is proposed as a means to investigate the potential of the strategy under discussion in predefined key-change scenarios that encompass different musical characteristics. For the existing compositions, we compare the results of our proposed methodology with others from the music information retrieval literature. Finally, although the proposed methodology is only capable of <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> changes and not the key identities themselves, we discuss results regarding the labeling of a composition’s key in the located segments. The notion of tonality is fundamental in Western music. Most aspects of tonal analysis are based o...|$|E
40|$|Training {{in motor}} {{skills such as}} athletics, dance, or {{gymnastics}} is not possible today except in the direct presence of the coach/instructor. This paper describes a computer vision based gesture recognition system {{which is used to}} metamorphose the user into a Virtual person, e. g. as a Kathakali dancer, which is graphically recreated at a near or diatant location. Thus this can be seen by an off-site coach using low-bandwidth joint-motion data which permits real time animation. The metamorphosis involves altering the appearance and identity of the user and also creating a specific environment possibly in interaction with other virtual creatures. A robust vision module is used to identify the user, based on very simple binary image processing in real time which also manages to resolve self-occlusion, correct for clothing/colour and other variations among users. Gestures are identified by <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> points at the shoulder, elbow and wrist joint, which are then recreated in an articulated humanoid model, which in this instance, representes a Kathakali dancer in elaborate traditional dress.

30|$|One {{characteristic}} of {{this finding is}} that it is inconsistent with a strict interpretation of the eye–mind hypothesis (Just & Carpenter, 1980; Reichle et al., 1998; Reilly & Radach, 2006). It appears that the event index of causality, in relation to the bomb, in participants’ event models is not guiding eye movements, while agency is having a modest effect. One way of explaining these results is in terms of the above-mentioned local and global levels of coherence. Perhaps the process of identifying and <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> agents in the narrative, and attending to them, is an important local coherence maintenance process, as suggested by the agent effect found in experiment 2 a. Agent tracking may operate at a lower level than the maintenance and calculation of causal relationships (e.g., potential consequences of the bomb), which may be considered more of a global coherence maintenance process. According to this idea, during film viewing, local processing of the narrative may strongly guide eye movements, while global processing of the narrative may have a weaker effect. This would not necessarily suggest that global processing of causal event indices cannot affect eye movements. It is possible that, for example, because the bomb was hidden in the trunk of the car, a look at its hiding place provided no new information. 6 Nevertheless, this interpretation of the results would argue for a weaker version of the eye–mind hypothesis. Namely, depending on viewers’ level of coherence processing (i.e., local vs. global) there may be stronger or weaker associations between eye movements and thought (Lamont, Henderson, & Smith, 2010; Smith, 2015).|$|E

40|$|Context: Modern {{commercial}} {{computer games}} use {{a number of}} different stimuli to assist players in <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> objects in the presented Virtual Environment (VE). These stimuli range from visual to auditory, and are employed in VEs depending on several factors such as gameplay design and aesthetics. Objectives: This study compares three different localization aids in order to evaluate their effectiveness in VEs. Method: An experiment is carried out in which testplayers are tasked with using audio signals, visual input, as well as a combination of both to correctly identify objects in a virtual scene. Results: Results gained from the experiment show how long testplayers spent on tests which made use of different stimuli. Upon analyzing the data, it was found that that audio stimulus was the slowest localization aid, and that visual stimulus and the combination of visual and auditory stimulus were tied for the fastest localization aid. Conclusions: The study concludes that there is a significant difference in efficiency among different localization aids and VEs of varied visual complexity, under the condition that the testplayer is familiar with each stimuli. 3 D-ljud och visuella hjälpmedel är vanliga i moderna datorspel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how an English as a Second Language (ESL) doctoral candidate becomes enculturated in the discursive practices of his discipline as he writes his dissertation. The notion of disciplinary enculturation refers to the processes whereby students acquire academic literacy and knowledge in the discipline. It involves an apprenticeship process by which graduate students become competent in using the genre, norms and conventions of the field. The present study explored the enculturation process of an ESL doctoral candidate in agricultural economics using qualitative research methods. ^ The investigation was conducted at Purdue University over the course of two years. During this time, data were gathered by observing student-professor meetings, conducting interviews—open-ended, semi-structured, and discourse-based, and collecting copies of all written documents. Following Miles and Huberman (1994), the analysis of the data consisted of an analytic progression that went from describing what happened to <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> themes and patterns to establishing relationships among those elements. It included the use of charts and matrices to sort, cluster, and link the information collected. In addition, an ethnomethodological approach was used to enhance the analysis of written discourse. ^ Major findings revealed the epistemological nature of writing in the production of a dissertation based on simulation modeling and statistical analysis. It also showed that the apprenticeship process was deeply affected by the status of discipline with respect to other disciplines. Furthermore, disciplinary discourse was found to have a dual role in the apprenticeship process since the doctoral candidate was enculturated to use disciplinary discourse and enculturated through disciplinary discourse. ...|$|E
40|$|Gatekeepers {{in social}} {{research}} constitute an interesting social phenomenon as powerful and normally unpaid agents of research access. Yet, questions {{relating to the}} recruitment of potential gatekeepers and {{to the nature of}} the rewards than they might seek are under-considered and <b>locating</b> <b>key</b> gatekeepers is often characterised as a matter of luck or happenstance. This paper suggests that access to gatekeepers in the conduct of social research is critical when engaging with elite organisations and that it is something which cannot be left to chance but needs to be systematically pursued. Using the example of the shipping industry the paper explains how social researchers can make use of their understandings of the non-pecuniary motivations of gatekeepers in seeking research access. Negotiations with gatekeepers are more likely to succeed when researchers are able to mobilise non-financial resources which have some alternative form of ‘exchange value’. Every year executives come together at commercially organized conferences focussed upon human resource management in the shipping industry. At these events, major global players discuss a programme of issues related to the business of recruiting and training seafarers. However, these international conferences are both much more and much less than they seem. This paper explores their purpose and in doing so reveals the ways in which they can be useful to social researchers. It argues that unlike most conferences these can only be seen as ‘field configuring events’ to a very limited extent but that they nonetheless serve an important purpose in securing symbolic, and more significantly reputational, capital for both individual delegates and interested academics. The paper argues that researchers can mobilise such capital in their favour in negotiating research access...|$|E
40|$|Cancer causes {{deviations}} in {{the distribution}} of cells, leading to changes in biological structures that they form. Correct localization and characterization of these structures are crucial for accurate cancer diagnosis and grading. In this paper, we introduce an effective hybrid model that employs both structural and statistical pattern recognition techniques to locate and characterize the biological structures in a tissue image for tissue quantification. To this end, this hybrid model defines an attributed graph for a tissue image and a set of query graphs as a reference to the normal biological structure. It then <b>locates</b> <b>key</b> regions that are most similar to a normal biological structure by searching the query graphs over the entire tissue graph. Unlike conventional approaches, this hybrid model quantifies the <b>located</b> <b>key</b> regions with two different types of features extracted using structural and statistical techniques. The first type includes embedding of graph edit distances to the query graphs whereas the second one comprises textural features of the key regions.
