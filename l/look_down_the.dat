25|$|In some cases, a {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} may {{be carried out}} - an {{endoscope}} is used to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> trachea, and mucus and cells are washed out of the lower airways for analysis. Typically, a BAL recovers an abnormally high percentage of neutrophils from an RAO horse - up to 50 or 70% in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Back in 1919, Jo asks Louisa to {{help her}} find the {{container}} {{so that they can}} move it, to prevent the later disastrous events happening in 1995. The well is located in the yard of a neighbouring house which is rented by a British visitor to the area, Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne. Jo and Louisa enter the yard and <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> well, but are disturbed in their actions by Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne. Their activities are watched by a teenage boy, Nicholas, whom Sir Ivor had brought from Russia to New Zealand, under the guise of caring for the boy until the dangerous situation in Russia abated. Although Nicholas is grateful to Sir Ivor for his help, he is extremely worried about his family, whom he has not heard about for a long time - and he is worried about the lack of information he receives whenever he asks Sir Ivor about them. Nicholas is also upset that Sir Ivor refuses to allow him to leave the house, or to have any friends of his own age.|$|E

25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
2500|$|Folklore records a {{story as}} a result of the {{explosion}}, Captain Jerome had been blown so high into the air, that he could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ship's chimney, also flying through the air, and see pilot Bas Miller lying dazed on the river bank where the explosion had left him.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock popularized the {{dolly zoom}} in this film, {{leading to the}} technique's sobriquet, amongst several others, [...] "the Vertigo effect". This [...] "dolly-out/zoom-in" [...] method {{involves}} the camera physically moving away from a subject whilst simultaneously zooming in (a similar effect can be achieved in reverse), so that the subject retains its size in the frame, but the background's perspective changes. Hitchcock used the effect to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tower shaft to emphasise its height and Scottie's disorientation. Following difficulties filming the shot on a full-sized set, {{a model of the}} tower shaft was constructed, and the dolly zoom was filmed horizontally.|$|E

60|$|The {{announcement}} was electrifying {{and there was}} an immediate rush to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E

6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Peter promptly, {{turning his}} back to Old Mr. Toad. [...] "I'll <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Crooked Little Path for five minutes and promise not to peek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} sky, but attend to what I say. <b>Look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> trunk and count the limbs below {{you on this}} side. How many limbs have you passed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just come to {{that seat}} now you are here, Miss Stanley, and <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> other path; there's a vista of just the common sort. Better even than these." ...|$|E

60|$|Everybody {{turned to}} <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Lone Little Path. There, ambling {{along in the}} most matter-of-fact and unconcerned way imaginable, came a certain small person who was dressed wholly in black and white.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "they are. But I {{will show}} you how they manage that by and by. There is {{something}} very curious about that. Now let us <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river again." ...|$|E

60|$|All {{shifted their}} {{position}} {{so as to}} <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> valley. An Indian chief, holding up his hands {{to show that he}} was unarmed, was advancing on foot, accompanied by another Indian also without arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "All of {{the little}} meadow people and forest folks turned to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Lone Little Path, {{but it was so}} dark none could see, none but Hooty the Owl, whose eyes are made to see in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "It gets {{me going}} when I <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle {{at the altar}} and see the arches and so on. And the priests in their robes--they look so--so way up--oh, I dunno just how to say it--so kind of uplifted." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he opened}} his eyes and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rifle with a quivering mouth.|$|R
60|$|She blushed and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river. 'I cannot give my reasons,' she said.|$|R
