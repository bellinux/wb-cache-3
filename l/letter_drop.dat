25|$|Several {{weeks after}} General Robert E. Lee's surrender, Mosby's status was uncertain, as some posters above the {{signature}} of Gen. Winfield S. Hancock stated that marauding bands would be destroyed and specifically named Mosby as a guerrilla chief and {{not included in the}} parole, although Mosby received a copy on April 12 at a <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> in the Valley along with a letter from Hancock's chief of staff, Gen. C.H. Morgan, calling on Mosby to surrender and promising the same terms as extended to Gen. Lee. Further negotiations followed, at Winchester and Millwood. Finally, on April 21, 1865, in Salem, Virginia, Mosby disbanded the rangers, and on the following day many former rangers rode their worst horses to Winchester to surrender, receive paroles and return to their homes.|$|E
60|$|Then his {{expression}} changed, {{and a few}} moments afterward he let the <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> and sat very still. The cigarette went out, the hot sun shone upon his uncovered head, and a lizard ran across his leg; {{but he did not}} move. He seemed lost in thought. Walthew, watching with puzzled sympathy, waited for him to speak.|$|E
6000|$|The third {{letter was}} from Rufus Dingwell; announcing {{the close of}} his tour in Ireland, and his {{intention}} of shortly joining Amelius in London. The excellent American expressed, with his customary absence of reserve, his fervent admiration of Irish hospitality, Irish beauty, and Irish whisky. [...] "Green Erin wants but one thing more," [...] Rufus predicted, [...] "to be a Paradise on earth--it wants the day to come when we shall send an American minister to the Irish Republic." [...] Laughing over this quaint outbreak, Amelius turned from the first page to the second. As his eyes fell on the next paragraph, a sudden change passed over him; he let the <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> on the floor.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the brush pass is the live <b>letter</b> <b>drop,</b> in which one agent follows a predefined route, on foot, with a prepared report hidden in a pocket. En route, a second agent unknown to the first agent picks his/her pocket and then passes the report on unread, either to a cut-out or to an intelligence officer. This technique presents opportunities both for plausible deniability and for penetration by hostile agents.|$|E
5000|$|Reese {{had its own}} {{post office}} {{starting}} in 1895; Miss Angie Lane was the first postmistress there, and had the name [...] "Andy" [...] established (for a Jacksonville postmaster, A.J. [...] "Andy" [...] Chessher) initially at the settlement. [...] The area had a post office until the mid-1900s, but since then residents have received rural route service from nearby Jacksonville; otherwise, <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> service and stamps can be found much closer, {{at the post office}} in Cuney.|$|E
50|$|The {{cities of}} Armadale and Cockburn {{joined forces to}} lobby the federal {{government}} to try to secure millions of dollars during the campaign to upgrade major road infrastructure. The two councils believed $300 million was needed to transform more of Armadale Road into a dual carriageway and to build a new bridge over Kwinana Freeway to link North Lake Road at Cockburn Central. The councils planned to <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> householders voting in the Canning by-election urging them to email federal and state MPs to help secure the funding. At the Labor Party state conference on 29 August, Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten promised to spend $170 million on infrastructure projects in Canning.|$|E

50|$|As {{he began}} his {{employment}} with GCHQ in England Prime received Soviet radio messages at night, and was informed of a dead <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> in Esher, Surrey. At the drop he found Â£400 and a note congratulating him. Prime used his Minox camera to photograph documents and sent them using microdots to East Berlin. Other dead letter drops used by Prime were in Abbey Wood in South East London and Banstead railway station in Surrey. Prime would use empty Coca-Cola cans to communicate at the drops as well as chalk marks on trees. Despite his use of drops Prime preferred to meet his handlers personally as the drops were not sufficient for the large amounts of material he produced for them.|$|E

5000|$|When Chambers {{went into}} the Soviet {{underground}} in mid-1932, Cantwell knew; he declined to let Chambers use his home as a <b>letter</b> <b>drop.</b> In April 1934, Cantwell met Chambers' underground comrade, John Loomis Sherman, whom he knew as [...] "Phillips." [...] For {{the rest of his}} life, Cantwell would remain unclear about just how much he knew about or was involved in Chambers' underground activities. In May 1934, when Chambers started working with the Ware Group (according to Cantwell's papers), Cantwell accompanied him; about this time, Chambers let Cantwell know that he was using the alias [...] "Lloyd Cantwell" [...] in Baltimore. Biographer Seyersted notes that in his 1952 memoir Witness, Chambers may have changed dates for his first meetings in Washington for the Ware Group to June and later in order to protect Cantwell.|$|E
40|$|Altruistic {{behaviour}} varies across {{human populations}} and this variation {{is likely to}} be partly explained by variation in the ecological context of the populations. We hypothesise that area level socio-economic characteristics will determine the levels of altruism found in individuals living in an area and we use a lost letter experiment to measure altruism across 20 neighbourhoods {{with a wide range of}} income deprivation scores in London, UK. The results show a strong negative effect of neighbourhood income deprivation on altruistic behaviour, with <b>letters</b> <b>dropped</b> in the poorest neighbourhoods having 91 % lower odds of being returned than <b>letters</b> <b>dropped</b> in the wealthiest neighbourhoods. We suggest that measures of altruism are strongly context dependant...|$|R

5000|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} in the community in 1877. The place name Halfway (historically also spelled Half Way) is said to have referred to the town's location halfway between Bowling Green and the Tennessee state line on the horse-drawn mail route. Though no Official Post Office had existed for many years there- owing {{in large part to the}} historical significance- the USPS would offer to make the owners of the local general store, the Halfway Trading Post, Honorary Postmasters. This allowed the owners of the store to operate a small <b>letter</b> <b>drop</b> inside the store, with postal boxes available only to residents of Halfway, giving the store the full federal protection of a building housing an official Post Office. In addition, the owners were entitled to a small stipend for their duties as [...] "Postmaster", though they did not have official status as such. The Last honorary Postmaster of Halfway, Ky was Martha Shaddix. The Halfway Post Office closed in May 1997 upon Ms. Shaddix having sold the property.|$|E
