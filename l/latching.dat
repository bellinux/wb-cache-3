Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for <b>latching</b> on to prey.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, players {{must find}} and collect items that improve Samus's arsenal and suit, {{including}} weapons, armor upgrades for Samus's Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress {{herself into a}} ball in order to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by <b>latching</b> onto special hooks called grapple points, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that allows her to climb magnetic rails.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by <b>latching</b> onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of <b>latching</b> onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over.

5|$|Bostwick {{was offered}} a new deal by Ebbsfleet ahead of the 2008–09 season, but {{rejected}} the offer and instead opted to join Stevenage on a two-year deal, playing under the management of Graham Westley once more. He made his debut for Stevenage in the club's opening match of the season, a 5–0 defeat to Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground. Bostwick was used in both the centre of defence and the centre of midfield {{during the first half}} of the 2008–09 season, as well as playing at full back in the club's 1–0 defeat to Kettering Town in September 2008. Bostwick provided the assist for Lee Boylan's second-minute goal against Forest Green Rovers in a 3–0 victory. A month later, he scored his first goal for the club, scoring in the 80th minute against Mansfield Town to give Stevenage a 3–2 lead. He scored his second goal of the season against Weymouth in February 2009, <b>latching</b> onto a long pass and sliding the ball past the goalkeeper to secure a 3–0 away win. Bostwick also scored Stevenage's first in a 2–0 away win at Crawley Town, scoring with a strike from just outside the area as Stevenage finished in the final play-off spot. He subsequently played in both of Stevenage's Conference Premier play-off matches against Cambridge United in April 2009, as the club lost 4–3 on aggregate. Bostwick played in all seven of the club's successful FA Trophy campaign, as well as playing the whole match in Stevenage's 2–0 win against York City in the Final at Wembley Stadium. The FA Trophy win meant that Bostwick had won the competition in consecutive years. Bostwick made a total of 49 appearances in his first season at Stevenage, scoring three times.|$|E

He began his football career in England, playing in the Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002. He scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions, before attracting the attention of then–Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season, he subsequently joined the club on a one-year contract in July 2004 after a successful trial. He made his debut as a substitute for the Somerset side in a 4–3 defeat against Torquay United in the Football League Trophy in September 2004. He made his second Yeovil appearance in a 3–1 victory away at Histon in an FA Cup tie, scoring his only goal for the club deep into injury-time. He made a further four appearances for the side, before leaving the club in February 2005 due to personal reasons, and subsequently joined Conference South side Eastbourne Borough two days later. Odubade made his Eastbourne Borough debut in the club's 2–0 victory against Basingstoke Town just three days after signing for the club, playing 45 minutes of the match. In the following game, he scored twice as Eastbourne came from back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at Cambridge City, scoring both goals within the space of five minutes. Odubade made it five goals in his first three games for Eastbourne, as he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 home victory against Thurrock. He also scored Eastbourne's third goal in a 3–1 win in the following game against Newport County, <b>latching</b> onto a long ball and beating the goalkeeper first time. Throughout March 2005, Odubade scored in four consecutive games, netting against Cambridge City, Havant & Waterlooville, Sutton United, and Hayes to take his tally to ten goals for the club. He also provided the assists for two of Eastbourne's goals in a 3–0 win against Redbridge, and scored two goals in late April 2005 against Bishop's Stortford and Weston-Super-Mare respectively. He scored his last goal of the season in Eastbourne's 3–0 away win against Cambridge City in the play-off, and was in the side that lost 2–1 to Altrincham in the final.

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another <b>latching</b> region would allow for the <b>latching</b> of two input values at the two {{different}} outputs.

The gate is placed over a new <b>latching</b> region configured to process data only when both <b>latching</b> regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, <b>latching</b> regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to <b>latching</b> region 7. At this instant, <b>latching</b> region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the <b>latching</b> regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{large number}} of <b>latches</b> in current designs {{increase}} the complexity of formal verification and logic synthesis, since the growth of <b>latch</b> number leads the state space to explode exponentially.

In addition, the proposed approach detects sequential functional dependencies existing in the reachable state space only.
