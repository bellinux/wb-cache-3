40|$|Liability in {{tort law}} is all-or-nothing – a {{defendant}} is either fully <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> at all <b>liable</b> for a claimant’s loss. By contrast, this paper defends a causal theory of partial liability. I’ll {{argue that a}} defendant should {{be held liable for}} a claimant’s loss only to {{the degree to which the}} defendant’s wrongdoing contributed to the causing of the loss. I ground this principle in a conception of tort law as a system of corrective justice, and use it to critically evaluate different mechanisms for ‘limiting’ liability for consequences of wrongdoing and for ‘apportioning’ liability between multiple wrongdoers...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that at this time juries were still being used for tort cases in England and Wales, so the judge's role would be to sum up the law and then leave it for the jury to hold the defendant <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the clause}} is ambiguous, the court interprets it {{narrowly}} and contra proferens. The contra proferentem principle provides {{the basis for}} determining the reach of such clauses. They are interpreted restrictively, confining them within reasonable bounds {{to the extent that}} this can be done without straining the clear meaning of a clause. This interpretation must be one to which the language is fairly susceptible; it must <b>not</b> be fanciful <b>or</b> remote. This means, for example, a provision may not be treated as an exemption clause at all, or a widely drawn clause may be interpreted as not referring to legal grounds of liability, or to cover only the minimum degree of blameworthiness for which the party would be <b>liable,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to deal with the circumstances of the claim, <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to protect against liability where this “would make a mockery of the other provisions of the contract,” in view of the obligations specifically assumed.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the following situation. A risk-neutral plaintiff sues a risk-neutral defendant for damages that are normalized to one. The defendant knows whether she is <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but the plaintiff does not. We ask what are the settlement procedure and fee-shifting rule (which, together, we call a mechanism) that minimize the rate of litigation subject to maintaining deterrence. Two main results are presented. The ?rst is a characterization of an upper bound on the rate of settlement {{that is consistent with}} maintaining deterrence. This upper bound is shown to be independent of the litigants' litigation cost. It is further shown that any mechanism that attains this upper bound must employ the English fee-shifting rule according to which all litigation costs are shifted to the loser in trial. The second result describes a simple practicable mechanism that attains this upper bound. We discuss our results in the context of recent legal reforms in the U. S. and U. K. litigation; settlement; fee-shifting; pleadings; deterrence...|$|R

40|$|Collateral Warranties are {{contractual}} {{agreements between}} parties who otherwise {{might not be}} in a contractual arrangement. In {{the case of an}} Architect it is unlikely he will have a contractual relationship with purchaser, tenant and funder of the constructed building. Therefore the purpose of Collateral Warranty is to create contractual relationship between the Architect and these parties. Particular issue are raised in relation to clauses dealing with "reasonable skill and care". What does this phrase mean and how does a judge, decide whether this standard has been achieved? The objective of this research is to determine the implication of Collateral Warranty on Architects and look into the circumstances in which the Architect is either <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> towards those defects in performing his duty. This research will be limited to cases in Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States of America, regarding detailed provision of variation clauses in relation to ‘collateral warranties’ and Architects in "exercise reasonable skill and care’ in the most commonly used standard forms of contracts, i. e. PAM 2006 Form, PWD 203 A (Rev. 10 / 83), RIBA CE/ 99, SFA/ 99, JCT and provision under Common Law. Finding from this research, Architect can be pursued by parties other than his client in Collateral Warranty. At the same time, Architect will under no circumstances have a greater liability to the third party than he already owes to the client. The use of phrase such as ‘utmost skill and care’ and ‘highest degree of skill and care’ do not tend to add to the Architect’s obligation, as the benchmark by which his performance to be judge is the exercise of such reasonable skill and care as would be exercise by a reasonably competent member of his profession. When the Architect is asked to provide collateral warranty, he is entitled to additional fees calculated on a time basis. Architect is also <b>not</b> <b>liable</b> to gives warranty on "fitness for purpose" as his obligation is to provide adequate advice in his profession to ensure client’s interest is achieved...|$|R

In 2002, one Allegheny student committed suicide, and his parents sued the school; a jury in 2006 found that the school was <b>not</b> <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> negligent.

30|$|To {{obtain the}} {{modified}} porosity variation, which {{is complex and}} of many unknown parameters, the calculation can be simplified as far as possible. Firstly, the fluid flow rate U_f, porous pressure P_f, and porosity variation dϕ_v due to compressibility of matrix and fluid at time t is obtained. Then, substitute dϕ_v into the typical wave equation and get new values of rock physical property P_f^', U_f^', ρ_f^' and η_f^'. Third, substitute the rock physical properties into the modified porosity model, and replace dϕ_v with the new value of porosity variation dϕ. Finally, combined with dϕ or ξ, establish the motion equation and continuity equation at the next moment {{in terms of the}} new porosity, ϕ_t + 1 = ϕ_t + dϕ_t or ϕ_t + 1 = ϕ_t + ξ· e_t· 1 - ϕ_t/ 1 + e_t.

One way to address the issue is the formation of GM-free or GM-only clubs. We model the decisions of individual farmers to cultivate either GM or non-GM crops and combine this with a game theoretic model of club formation to investigate the feasibility of such clubs. We consider two liability regimes: GM farmers are <b>liable</b> <b>or</b> they are <b>not.</b> We consider two benchmarks: Nash equilibrium without negotiations and the efficient allocation and compare those with partial co-operation through a Coasean club. We find that in both regimes a relatively large club can form but they are not always necessary to reach the efficient allocation. In fact, if farmers can freely decide under profit maximisation what to cultivate, they reach 95 % of an efficient allocation. This holds independent of the property rights system and provides strong support for coexistence policies based on ex-post liability such as in the US and Spain. </p...|$|R
