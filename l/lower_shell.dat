Turtle shells are also composed of two layers of osteoderms, while cyamodontoid shells only have one layer. Cyamodontoids typically have more osteoderms forming their carapaces and plastrons (upper and <b>lower</b> <b>shells)</b> than do turtles, and the osteoderms have less well-defined shapes than the geometric scutes of turtles.|$|R

The colors of the mature turtles are lighter and more muted than the colors of the young. Most, but not all, male turtles have red irises. Other characteristics of males include concave plastrons, thicker tails with the cloaca nearer the tip, and longer rear legs with larger, curved inside claws which are used to grip the female shell during mating.|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} of the baryon spectrum is performed using the hypercentral Consituent Quark Model (hCQM), mainly {{in comparison with the}} harmonic oscillator (h. o.). Recentlly many new states, at various levels of confidence have been observed, leading to a softening of the missing resonance problem in the case of positive parity states. However, the number of negative states is higher that predicted by the commonly used h. o. scheme and therefore one is forced to take into account also the higher energy shells, which contain an overall number of states much greater than the observed one. It is shown that, thanks to the peculiar level scheme of the hCQM, the recently observed negative parity states can be considered as belonging to the <b>lower</b> <b>shells,</b> keeping the missing resonance problem within more acceptable limits...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} to electron-impact ionization cross sections from excitations to high-nl shells and a consequent autoionization is investigated.

The obtained {{results show that the}} excitations to the high shells (n >= 9) increase cross sections of the indirect ionization process by a factor of 2 compared to the excitations to the <b>lower</b> <b>shells</b> (n <= 8). The excitations to the shells with orbital quantum number l = 4 give the largest contribution comparedwith the other orbital quantum numbers l.

50|$|The SunStang team {{encountered}} serious challenges at the 2007 WSC. Within 30 {{minutes from}} the start line, just at the outskirts of Darwin, the solar vehicle struck a large rock situated on the road at a speed of 65 km/h. The resulting accident cause the vehicle to spin violently into the ditch. The driver was unharmed. Severe damage was inflicted on the rear suspension as the in-wheel electric motor was completely fractured from the chassis. The upper and <b>lower</b> <b>shells</b> of the vehicle body also sustained moderate damage. After receiving help from a nearby cattle rancher {{in the form of}} two steel plates, the team was able to sandwich the rear suspension back onto the carbon-foam-core chassis. The SunStang was back on the road within 5 hours. However, continuing concerns over safety of the in-wheel motor precluded completion of the race without SunStang being hauled in a trailer. After the race was called off due to severe weather storms, the team made it to the finish line at Adelaide on October 28, 2007.|$|R
50|$|Absorber : As the {{refrigerant}} vapor migrates to the absorber {{from the}} evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed {{over the top}} of the absorber tube bundle.

The exterior has a tiered dome, but the hexagonal interior has the geometric elaborations with alternating convex and concave chapels that recall the architecture of Juvarra and Borromini. In the dome, the elaborately decorated ribs, reminiscent of Guarini’s work, intersect to form a complex design illuminated by natural light playfully concealed by hidden windows.

5000|$|Blanding's turtle is a {{medium-sized}} turtle {{with an average}} shell length of approximately 18 to 23 cm with a maximum of 25.5 cm. A distinguishing feature of this turtle is the bright yellow chin and throat. The carapace, or upper shell, is domed, but slightly flattened along the midline, and is oblong when viewed from above. The carapace is speckled with numerous yellow or light-colored flecks or streaks on a dark background. The plastron, or <b>lower</b> <b>shell,</b> is yellow with dark blotches symmetrically arranged. The head and legs are dark, and usually speckled or mottled with yellow.

5|$|The {{stabilisation}} of ununennium's {{valence electron}} {{and thus the}} contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm), so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the <b>lower</b> <b>shells.</b> Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, {{in addition to the}} +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected. Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding.|$|R

Much of the heat input to the outside dewar shell is radiative heat transfer from the solar panel. To <b>lower</b> the <b>shell</b> temperature, radiative cooled shields were placed between the solar panel and the dewar shell and between the bus and the dewar shell.
