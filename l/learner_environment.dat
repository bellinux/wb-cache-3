The authors assign a prosodic structure, including syllable structure and location of primary stress, to words in large samples of child-directed speech in both languages, and measure {{the means and standard deviations}} of the relevant structures across samples. The results show a remarkable consistency within languages on all measures, and a very large difference between the two languages in each dimension, which may account for some of the cross-linguistic acquisition differences. In addition, the authors divide the samples by the age of the target child, and show that the frequency of coda consonants and weak initial syllables remain constant in both languages as the age of the target child increases, in contrast to other measures, such as mean length of utterance. The frequencies of these features correspond, in a direct way, to the timecourse of their acquisition in each language.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the interaction between}} teacher and learner as one which involves providing opportunities for "learning moments," a concept {{found in the literature}} on organizational leadership. Learning moments are seen as dynamic events that occur when four complex elements intersect: teacher, <b>learner,</b> <b>environment,</b> and chance. One of the major features of this approach is the disconnection between a teacher's efforts and actual student learning. The model described in this paper proposes a more collaborative effort and encourages viewing teaching as a power ally in, but not directly responsible for, student learning. But this view of learning raises questions about modern approaches to the assessment of teaching and learning in higher education, and it is suggested that rather than focusing on student outcomes, attention should focus on what is done by teachers, students, and institutions within the ambiguous context of learning moments; and that rather than trying to assess when and how learning moments occur...|$|E
40|$|Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) in its {{broadest}} {{sense is}} often described as an attempt by educators to provide a schooling-to-work pathway to support the employability of graduates.

These imperatives we have derived from published mission statements, public policies, and institutional governance expressions, e. g.

40|$|Advancements in {{technology}} have {{enabled us to}} learn, adapt and exploit our skills and knowledge in new ways.   Appreciating the potential of technology may yet give growth and enrich the process of language education, particularly through a student-centred mobile learning environment. Consequently, a constructivist approach to learning can create tremendous possibilities for both language learners and teachers. By exploiting the affordances of mobile technologies and the Internet, a new platform of learning or Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) can be realised, through which learners truly learn to learn.   Yet, while many of today’s language institutions and places of learning have begun to understand the potential presented by mobile technology as a tool and resource to content and language development, apprehension may still exist among educational practitioners, learners and senior management.   Such apprehension may stem {{from a lack of}} understanding in fully appreciating the opportunities and affordances posed by MALL in creating a support structure to learning and teaching excellence. This may be particularly true within developing countries such as those found in the Middle East. Consequently, set in a Saudi university context, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate learners’ and teachers’ perceptions towards the proposed implementation of a MALL programme, while exploring whether the promotion of mobile technologies could assist learning and become a viable support structure in teaching English as a second language.   Interviews were conducted with three English instructors who teach on the first year Business English programme at the university. The study also analysed 191 student participants who completed a Likert scale questionnaire designed to explore their mobile learning experiences, attitudes and perceptions towards the proposed MALL programme in their educational context. The findings from the student questionnaire and teacher interviews generally highlight positive attitudes and a receptiveness towards mobile learning implementation. This is perhaps due to the possibility of new pedagogical scaffoldings being created through MALL in their learning/teaching environment. The results further highlighted opportunities MALL presented in facilitating communication and affording learners greater motivation to engage in independent learning, thus facilitating learner autonomy and allowing for greater collaboration within a richer <b>learner</b> <b>environment.</b> However, while analysis highlighted a proposed MALL implementation could be a useful tool to support language acquisition for ESP/ESL learners (English for Specific Purposes/English as a Second Language), technical issues, network sustainability and comprehensive training were still significant factors of concern...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{problems}} are a constant threat to {{student learning and}} the <b>learner</b> <b>environment,</b> namely, the classroom. Researchers have identified empirically validated classroom-based strategies to support teachers to manage/deal with problem behaviours, {{but there has been}} very little research on whether these strategies are used in New Zealand (NZ) classrooms. The purpose of this present study is to fill the gap by conducting a survey of teachers’ self-reported use of management strategies, to increase students’ learning engagement and academic outcomes, and reduce behaviour interruptions. The present study is a partial replication and extension of a cross-cultural comparative study conducted in the United States (US) and Greece by Akin-Little, Little, and Laniti (2007) {{to determine the extent to}} which teachers’ utilized research-based management strategies in their classroom. The process and methodology of the present study was similar in that it used the same questionnaire but a different sample of teachers. The replication was an opportunity to compare the US-Greek findings with the situation here in NZ. The survey questionnaire was slightly modified to cater for the New Zealand demographic, such as the racial/ethnic background of the participants and the racial/ethnic composition of the classes. Another change was made regarding the use of “corporal punishment” in the school, which was replaced with the use of “restraint,” as non-violent crisis physical restraint is used as a last resort in some NZ schools/classrooms as a safety strategy to manage acting out students’ extreme behaviour. The use of corporal punishment was banned in all NZ schools (including Early Childhood Centres) in 1990. Participants for this study comprised 53 practising teachers from a range of co-educational primary schools within the metropolitan area of Auckland. The survey questionnaire contained four sections which gathered information on teacher characteristics, classroom rules, classroom child-management systems, and teachers’ perceptions of their role as a teacher, relative to their use of classroom-based management strategies. The results showed that most schools used a school-wide discipline plan, and a large number of teachers developed their own classroom rules with student input. Teachers’ overall reported the use of research-based management strategies (including those identified in the survey), as well as approaches appropriate to the ecology, culture/climate, and ethos of their particular school. In addition, the results showed that there was a greater emphasis on strengthening positive teacher-student relationships and proactive, preventative systems of managing behaviour, with less frequent resort to reactive-consequence based approaches. The results further indicated that over half the teachers perceived they communicated and monitored their students frequently during lessons and could attend to more than one event without undue disruption. In regard to teacher efficacy, the majority of teachers perceived that their classroom management strategies were adequate. These results have important implications for teaching practices and student learning. A comparison with teacher classroom management practices in the United State and Greece, limitations of the study, and possible further studies in this area are discussed...|$|E
40|$|With {{universities}} {{adopting a}} learner-centered, constructivist {{approach to learning}} and greater use of technology, combined with the pressures of 21 st century living and {{the increasing number of}} people taking up tertiary study, there is a greater need than ever to determine how a learner constructs and uses his/her learning environment, and what drives that process of construction and use. This thesis investigates the <b>learner’s</b> learning <b>environment</b> from the <b>learner’s</b> perspective. Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews, and personality type as determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®, it identified three drivers that impact upon the construction and use of the <b>learner’s</b> learning <b>environment.</b> These three drivers are: 1) the learner’s impetus to learn; 2) the self-perceived technology ability of the learner; and 3) the personality type of the learner. This thesis looks at the construction of the <b>learner’s</b> learning <b>environment</b> as part of constructivist theory, recognizing that, as in the construction of new, individual representations of knowledge, each learner forms new, individual representations of his/her own learning environment, determined by the drivers that impact on this construction and use.

40|$|D. Cur. The overall aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} a model to facilitate reflective thinking of learners in clinical nursing education. This aim is realised through exploration and description of the meaning of reflective thinking in phase one of the study using Wilson (1963). Theoretical validity was ensured. The results of phase one provided a conceptual framework to direct data collection in phase two by exploring and describing the perceptions of nurse educators with regard to how reflective thinking of learners can be facilitated in clinical nursing education. An etic approach to qualitative data analysis as described by Morse (1994) was used, with matrices (Miles & Huberman, 1994) to provide meaningful categories, subcategories and themes. Both the results of phase one and two provided the main concepts, which were classified and defined within Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968 : 435) 's six components of the survey list. Conceptualisation of the six components constitutes phase three of the study. Lastly phase four deals with the description and evaluation of the model with guidelines to operationalise the model. Nurse educators, who are facilitators, are challenged with the responsibility to establish quality clinical nursing education in line with the international norms, ethics, legal and professional standards. They are challenged with the creation of the environment conducive to facilitate reflective thinking through interaction. The facilitative interactive methods of teaching and assessment based on the constructivistic approach to learning demands dialogue, discourse and narratives, and therefore problem-based learning, outcomes-based education and community-based education using the PHC principles forms an integral aspect in creating the environment conducive to the facilitation of reflective thinking in clinical nursing education. These teaching and learning approaches needs active involvement of the learner in constructing his/her own clinical knowledge, skills, attitudes and values through collaborative, co-operative shared activities in partnership with all other stakeholders responsible to provide clinical learning opportunities for learners to integrate theory to practice. The affective component of both the facilitator and the learner actually drives the process of reflective thinking in a specific cultural context. The traditional methods of teaching and evaluation hinder the facilitation of reflective thinking. Models and conceptual frameworks that address reflective thinking in nursing does not address how reflective thinking can be facilitated, hence the research question is "how can reflective thinking of learners be facilitated in clinical nursing education"? The explorative, descriptive, qualitative, theory generative and contextual design is used to describe a model to facilitate reflective thinking of learners in clinical nursing education, with guidelines to operationalise the model. Paradigmatic perspective with regard to man (facilitator and the <b>learner),</b> <b>environment</b> (clinical nursing education), reflective thinking (purpose) and the interactive facilitation as the dynamic of the study are described within Theory for Health Promotion in Nursing (1991). The constructivistic perspective provides the theoretical framework. The qualitative approach that is exploratory and descriptive for theory generation provides the methodological assumption. The results of concept analysis and the results of the perceptions of nurse educators with regard to how reflective thinking of learners can be facilitated in clinical nursing education provide conceptual meaning and identification. The identified major and minor concepts are classified and defined using Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968 : 435) 's six components of the survey list. Through synthesis, {{at the end of each}} conceptualisation, concluding relational statements are described from which the model is inferred. The model is described using Chinn and Kramer (1991 : 107 - 125) 's method of theory generation and evaluation. Experts in qualitative research and model development do refinement of the model. The facilitator is responsible to create the environment that is stimulating and conducive for learning. The learner on the other hand is responsible for selfdirected, self-regulatory learning where active participation in the construction of own learning through interaction is the hallmark, in order to facilitate reflective thinking in clinical nursing education. Interactive facilitation is the dynamic through which reflective thinking has to be facilitated. Clinical nursing education provides the context. The procedure to facilitate reflective thinking of learners in clinical nursing education is through the three phases of reflective thinking guided by the adapted educational process in the format of the nursing process. Once the purpose of the model is achieved (reflective thinking), the learners will be expected to improve practice through rational decision making and solving of problems. They will be expected to practice independently and autonomously, and to view clinical situations holistically with changed perspective based on the existing conception. Learners will have acquired skills for lifelong learning. The described guidelines will assist nurse educators with the operationalization of the model in order to provide quality assurance in clinical nursing education, with subsequent provision of quality nursing care and the improvement of the credibility of the profession...|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} this thesis is {{learning}} in internship in New Zealand (NZ). Internship {{is a period of}} apprenticeship in medicine which bridges the transition from medical school to practise as a registered doctor. It is a formal apprenticeship leading to the professional practise of medicine, and is central to the identity construction of the junior doctor. However, because the workplace is changing the traditional model of apprenticeship is described in the literature as failing. As a consequence, internship has been subject to cycles of review and reform {{since the turn of the}} century, first in the United Kingdom (UK) and more recently in Australia and NZ. Despite the reforms current literature and professional commentary indicate that the problems are not all solved by what are essentially structural reforms. A review of the literature on clinical learning and supervision identifies a gap in the research that is contributing to the wider problem. While it is recognised that supervision is a key component of internship there is no conceptual model or framework to guide supervisory practice or to inform the training of supervisors. This is the problem addressed in this thesis. This thesis proposes a solution using socio-cultural learning theory to understand learning in internship in order to offer an explanation of learning that can inform the supervisory practice; and then for the development of a model of learning and a supervision framework to guide and inform the practice of interns, supervisors and managers in health provider organisations. A review of the literature since 1990 (Chapter 2) shows that there has been very little research on postgraduate supervision but there has been considerable work investigating the learning environment (or the immediate context of learning), drawing on experiential learning theory, describing the attributes of supervisors, devising models for giving feedback, and more recently seeking to understand and explain learning at work and the development of expertise. However, the transference of research findings into a conceptual and structural model of supervision has not occurred. In addition, recent research (2002 - 2010) has demonstrated that social learning approaches exploring clinical/workplace learning can be useful in bridging this gap. While there is an emerging body of work exploring the immediate (ward or clinic) learning climate there remains an absence of research on supervision and little consideration of the wider organisational and professional context in which internship is conducted. Before proposing a solution, literature describing the learning demands placed on interns and the expectations placed on supervisors is used to develop criteria for a specification to guide the development of a model of supervision that will meet the needs of the sector. The specification recognises the importance of an underlying educational framework that: addresses how learning occurs, how competence is developed, the supervisee and supervisor relationship, relationships with the team, the structure and context of supervision in internship at both the micro-level (<b>learner</b> <b>environment)</b> and the macro-level (organisational and national). The specification also recognizes that within the NZ context a model of practicebased teaching and supervision must be flexible enough to be translated into varied health contexts, including Maori health environments. Certainly in a Maori world view, learning (ako) and health practice is seen as part of the community and knowledge is a treasure (taonga) owned by the community not by individuals. Practice must support the articles of the Treaty of Waitangi and therefore seek to encourage participation, partnership and self determination. (This is a legislative requirement in NZ.) The thesis is reported in three parts looking at the micro-level (learner - supervisor), and macro-level (organizational) levels of the problem, and then bringing these together to inform a framework for supervision. In Part I a series of studies explore interns’ perceptions of learning in clinical areas and support the proposition that a social learning perspective can be applied to internship. The initial exploratory qualitative study shows that interns recognise and value a participatory learning environment with supervision strategies that promote participation and engagement and which are linked to knowledge sharing and identity formation. From these outcomes a model is presented that sets out the critical components that ensure clinical settings are positive learning environments which encourage social interaction. The model also provides an evaluation tool to assess placements as learning environments. Finally, strategies are offered that both supervisors and learners can use to promote and support learning in clinical workplaces. Part II uses document analysis to describe the organisational and professional context of learning in internship in order to lay out clearly the wider environment in which internship is enacted, and to uncover the rich formal, and often tacit, informal learning opportunities available. Critical analysis of Wenger’s (1998) model of communities of practice (CoPs) shows that this conceptual model of learning can provide a framework to organize and consider the learning environment of internship in a way that is more compatible with a teambased approach to the delivery of healthcare than previous perspectives. Importantly, the CoP framework also appears to be compatible with a Maori world view and this offers a platform for future research by, or with, Maori practitioners to develop a blended model of supervision for Maori health contexts. The CoP framework and its potential as a conceptual model in the context on internship was shared and discussed within workshops at conferences and learning events with over 100 practitioners who identify and described three sites where CoPs naturally occur these are: the clinical team who provide patient care, the interprofessional ward or unit and the medical team. In Part III, descriptions of these three sites as CoPs, the data on support structures, formal and informal learning opportunities within health provider organizations and the outcomes from Part I are combined to develop a framework of supervision and to describe the roles and responsibilities of a supervisor. The result of combining these two streams of work is: 1. A model of learning by participation and engagement in clinical practice to guide supervisory practice and assist interns as they develop the skills needed to be active lifelong learners throughout their medical careers. 2. An alternative framework from which interns, supervisors and organisations can view, and therefore plan and coordinate internship. The thesis is upheld that social learning theory is useful as a framework for understanding learning in internship and for developing a framework to guide supervision. The potential to utilise socio-cultural models either as supplementary, or an alternative to individualistic models, and to utilise team and organisational learning is a strategy that fits with discourses about healthcare teams, patient safety, inter-professional learning and the emergent properties and facets of work within current post-reform health services. This thesis offers an alternative way to conceptualise and define the role of the supervisor and the supervisee and transform supervisory practice in a way that aligns it to modern healthcare systems of delivery and accountability with, and to, other health professionals and other stakeholders. This study concludes with recommendations for a framework and overarching structure that is neither implemented nor tested, and this is clearly a necessary direction for future research. It is hoped that publication of this framework will lead to further testing and refinement, including its applicability to Maori, and the exploration by Maori medical educators of the recommendation for a blended model of supervision. Internship as a period of identity formation is introduced within the framework, but is less well explained than was possible within this study and warrants further investigation. More work is also needed to explore the impact on learning of the hierarchical structures in health and the possibility that not all healthcare environments are friendly and supportive...|$|E

The learner can take advantage of these enhancements to further reduce the amount of input it has to deal with, by paying attention. Attention is a collection of mechanisms that determine the significance of stimuli. We argue that attention and stimulus enhancement can be used as tools for learning, and discuss their individual and mutual contributions to learning. We present two preliminary, statistical approaches to the modelling of attention, and point out several issues, problems, and possibilities for further work that arise.

50|$|When {{a learner}} {{interacts with the}} {{e-learning}} environment, it's called augmented learning. By adapting {{to the needs of}} individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the <b>learner's</b> natural <b>environment.</b> Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive education.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an innovative}} method of teaching basic {{skills necessary to}} effectively produce and receive messages while reducing the potential for misunderstandings. As educators, developing such methods is paramount to student success. Likewise, success beyond college depends heavily on basic speaking and listening skills. Whether a student continues within academia or enters the workforce, s/he must possess {{the skills necessary to}} communicate in a competent fashion. This paper will first examine the theoretical distinction between skills and competence as well as research in the areas of memory and cognition. I then propose a method grounded on these precepts that also utilize e-learning technology to bring micro-lessons into the <b>learners</b> <b>environment.</b> Concept Keys leverages the established educational concepts of chunking, priming, and active learning into a learning support system that enables students to integrate information into their memory and into their skill base. Example exercises are also presented as well as a call for further research...|$|R
50|$|When {{a learner}} browses the web or reads a document, {{the act of}} {{pointing}} with a mouse or touching a screen commands a pop-up window to provide supplemental information. This in-context, augmented content may {{take the form of}} text, images, video, or even music or speech. By tailoring the supplemental content to the <b>learner’s</b> immediate <b>environment,</b> the <b>learner</b> associates the supplemental information with the original text.|$|R
30|$|Connectivist models or {{theories}} {{treat the}} <b>learner’s</b> <b>environment</b> as unique to that learner, largely under their control, {{but at the}} same time deeply and indivisibly social, formed by and embedded within a network of connections. This is networked individualism (Wellman, 2002) writ large. Unlike the traditional hierarchical, teacher-controlled, scheduled, planned, goal-driven groups of traditional education, networks are by definition centred around nodes (individuals), and are different for every learner (Dron & Anderson, 2014). Teacher-like roles – didactic, supportive, role-modelling, and so on - are played by other nodes of the network, including the non-human, but most prominently by the learners themselves. The central skill of connectivist era learners is that of sense-making: of being able to discern patterns, make connections, filter out the useless, organize the useful, find meaning in the plethora of knowledge flowing through the network. Networked learners are not working alone – there may be many ways they are helped by, inspired by, and guided by others, including digital systems – but they are on a personal learning journey. A smart connectivist learning environment is not one that guides a learner to a predetermined destination, but one that is responsive, that challenges, engages, reflects back, and connects a learner with a network. What makes it smart is that, in adapting to the <b>environment,</b> <b>learners</b> play an active role in changing it (for themselves and others) and, in the process, they learn themselves.|$|R
30|$|Conversely, other {{environmental}} features {{may lead to}} more effective learning. Sometimes, a bland, evenly lit room at a comfortably temperature {{with a couple of}} chairs might be all that is needed to help provide focus. At other times, a walk in the garden, or a meandering voyage on a sailboat might provide the right combinations of relaxation, stimulation, exercise, and fresh air needed to spark inspiration and expansive thinking. Both learners and teachers can affect their environment. It makes a difference how they position chairs, what postures they adopt, whether a window is open, where they position themselves in relation to each other, where they choose to meet in the first place, and so on. Each decision makes the overall environment more or less smart for a given learner in a given situation. This also illustrates that, at least when an environment contains other people, every <b>learner’s</b> <b>environment</b> is different from that of every other. It is not the same environment to the tutor as it is for the student, because the student is in it, not the one that is experiencing it.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} of machine learning is deciding how to act in an uncertain world. For example, if I want my robot to bring me a cup of coffee, it {{must be able to}} compute the correct sequence of electrical impulses to send to its motors to navigate from the coffee pot to my office. In fact, since the results of its actions are not completely predictable, it is not enough just to compute the correct sequence; instead the robot must sense and correct for deviations from its intended path. In order for any machine learner to act reasonably in an uncertain environment, it must solve problems like the above one quickly and reliably. Unfortunately, the world is often so complicated that it is difficult or impossible to find the optimal sequence of actions to achieve a given goal. So, in order to scale our learners up to real-world problems, we usually must settle for approximate solutions. One representation for a <b>learner's</b> <b>environment</b> and goals is a Markov decision process or MDP. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} emphasis today on realistic applications of school mathematics. However, many educators assert that mathematics exists independently of its applications {{and that it}} should be taught in its “pure ” form. Such an approach ignores the lessons learned from the history of mathematics when significant advances resulted from attempts to solve important social problems. These applications include such topics as geometry in Ancient Egypt, astronomy in the middle ages, and computers in the modern era. In modern mathematics, symbolism has been developed independent of applications. Nevertheless, for the mathematics to be meaningful, appropriate applications must be foundational. In the recent history of mathematics considerable interest has developed in the field of ethnomathematics, which D’Ambrosio interprets to mean the mathematics used by any cultural group. Thus we can say that the study of ethnomathematics focuses attention on the real meaning of the mathematics being studied. From an instructional standpoint this means that a mathematics curriculum should draw stimulus from the <b>learner’s</b> <b>environment.</b> The presentation will include examples of an ethnomathematics approach to the curriculum from the presenter’s experience...|$|R

50|$|Technologies {{incorporating}} rich {{media and}} interaction {{have demonstrated the}} educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing. Instead of focusing on memorization, the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the <b>learner's</b> natural <b>environment</b> by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.|$|R
