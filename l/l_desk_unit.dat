50|$|Jack Scantlin of Scantlin Electronics, Inc. (SEI) {{developed}} the Quotron I system, {{consisting of a}} magnetic tape storage unit that could be sited at a brokerage and <b>Desk</b> <b>Units</b> with a keyboard and printer. The storage unit recorded {{the data from the}} ticker line. Brokers could enter the stock symbol on a <b>desk</b> <b>unit.</b> This triggered a backward search on the magnetic tape (which continued recording incoming ticker data). When a transaction was located, the price was sent to the <b>desk</b> <b>unit,</b> which printed it on a tape.|$|R
50|$|When Ultronics {{introduced}} their Stockmaster <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> in 1961 they priced {{the service}} at {{approximately the same}} price as the Quotron <b>desk</b> <b>units.</b> They did not want a price competition only a performance competition. All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges. The cost of the system, <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> at prices significantly less than Stockmaster or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their Stockmaster and Quotron systems. The Telequote <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their price cutting did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S.. Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this price cutting was not a factor.|$|R
50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each <b>desk</b> <b>unit</b> in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a <b>desk</b> <b>unit</b> identifier. Because the <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> set up the requested stock code statically the <b>desk</b> <b>unit</b> would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.|$|R
50|$|The first Quotron {{units were}} {{installed}} in 1960, and were an immediate success. By {{the end of}} 1961 brokers were leasing Quotrons in some 800 offices, serving some 2,500 <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> across the United States.|$|R

Since there was no cafeteria, students ate lunch at their desks.|$|R

50|$|Sinn formed Ultronic Systems Corp. in December 1960, and was {{president}} and CEO from then until {{he left the}} company in 1970. By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> (Stockmaster) in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Stockmaster <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and General Telephone (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company Reuters signed a joint venture agreement to market Stockmaster worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information. Ultronics invented time division multiplex equipment to utilize Reuters’ voice grade lines to Europe and the Far East to transmit U.S. stock and commodity information plus Reuters’ teletype news channels.|$|R
50|$|The 9:30 Club {{was founded}} by artist and dancer Dody DiSanto and her husband, Jon Bowers, a local real estate {{developer}} and music enthusiast who had just purchased the Atlantic Building in 1979.

50|$|STU-III is {{a family}} of secure {{telephones}} introduced in 1987 by the NSA {{for use by the}} United States government, its contractors, and its allies. STU-III <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> look much like typical office telephones, plug into a standard telephone wall jack and can make calls to any ordinary phone user (with such calls receiving no special protection, however). When a call is placed to another STU-III unit that is properly set up, one caller can ask the other to initiate secure transmission. They then press a button on their telephones and, after a 15-second delay, their call is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. There are portable and militarized versions and most STU-IIIs contained an internal modem and RS-232 port for data and fax transmission. Vendors were AT&T (later transferred to Lucent Technologies), RCA (Now L-3 Communications, East) and Motorola.|$|R

50|$|Scantlin Electronics reacted {{immediately}} to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system {{and put it into}} service in December, 1962. It used four Control Data CDC 160A computers in New York which recorded trading data in magnetic core memory. Major cities hosted Central Office equipment connected to newly designed Quotron II <b>desk</b> <b>units</b> in brokerage offices on which a broker could request, for any stock, price and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&T's Dataphone high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to address the role of ICT-support call-centres in {{supporting}} mobile professionals. In global organisations, mobile professionals require constant and continuous access to information services. In modern global banking firms, ICTs are intensively utilised for electronic transactional processing and in supporting banking professionals in accomplishing their global tasks across geographical locations and time zones. The use of ICTs by global mobile bankers is crucial to access real-time information, anytime and anywhere. In their remote mobility, banking professionals may experience technology failure or difficulties in accessing information services. This inability of the banking mobile professionals in utilising ICTs could have serious consequences in terms of risk on the bank operations and profit.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s when these first <b>desk</b> top {{quotation}} <b>units</b> were developed {{the only real}} time information available from the various stock and commodity exchanges were the last sale and the bid and ask ticker lines. The last sale ticker contained every trade with both price and volume for each trade. The bid-ask ticker contained only the two prices and no size. The volume of data on the last sale ticker was therefore much greater than on the bid-ask ticker. Because of this, on high volume days the last sale ticker would run as much as fifteen minutes behind the bid-ask ticker. This time difference made having the bid-ask on their <b>desk</b> top <b>unit</b> extremely important to a stockbroker {{even though there was}} an extra charge to the exchange for this information.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of performance data in organizations {{is often described}} as a functional process that managers enforce on their employees to provide leaders with accurate information about employees' work and their achievements. This study draws on a 15 -month ethnography of a <b>desk</b> sales <b>unit</b> to build a dramaturgical model that explains how managers participate in the {{production of}} performance data to impress rather than inform leaders. Research on management information systems is reviewed to outline a protective specification of this model where managers participate in the production of performance data to suppress information that threatens the image they present to leaders. Ethnographic data about the production and use of performance records and performance reports in a <b>desk</b> sales <b>unit</b> is examined to induce an exploitive specification of this dramaturgical model. This specification explains how people {{can take advantage of the}} opportunities, rather than just avoid the threats that performance data presents for impression management.
