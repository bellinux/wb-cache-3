60|$|For {{a moment}} Claire did not speak. Then she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and got up.|$|E
60|$|Joan <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> She had {{an article}} to finish. Madge stood on tiptoe and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|No {{one was in}} {{the room}} but Marian. She was reading, and she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> in surprise, when I came in.|$|E
6000|$|Before Miss Churton had {{finished}} welcoming Fan, Miss Starbrow, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and directly addressing the elder lady, {{said in a}} cold voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wants {{a quarter}} to six at present," [...] said Bathsheba, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "I daresay he'll be in directly. Well, now then"--she looked into the book--"Joseph Poorgrass, are you there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. What {{on earth}} {{are they going to}} do? (Going out.) I really must go and stop this--- (She follows them, {{speaking}} as she disappears. Gloria stares coolly at Valentine, and then deliberately <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Fleur <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and rose. His {{mother went}} with her into the house. Jon stayed with his father, puffing at the cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gallilee's maid <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{when the}} {{carriage}} left Mr. Mool's house. [...] "We shall be {{nearly an hour}} late, before we get home," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|The {{evening was}} drawing on; {{it was nearly}} half past seven when Helena <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> remembering Louisa, who would be {{waiting for her to}} return to Cornwall.|$|E
60|$|She {{unlocked}} the door, after first <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> It was close on twelve o'clock. There was barely an hour left to try her desperate experiment, and {{to return to}} the lodging before the landlady's children came back from school.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we can't {{get there}} by five, for it's half past four now," [...] said Diana, with a despairing <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "We'll arrive {{after they have}} had their tea, and they'll have all the bother of getting ours over again." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} door of {{communication}} and led the way eagerly into Magdalen's room. As Mrs. Lecount followed, she stole a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> Never before had time flown as it flew that morning! In twenty minutes more Mr. Bygrave would be back from his bath.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Milroy {{had just}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and had just}} put her hand once more to the bell-pull, {{when the door opened}} and the nurse entered the room.|$|E
60|$|Finding that I {{had nothing}} to say on my side, Mrs. Fosdyke <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and remembered her {{domestic}} duties. To my relief, our interview came to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "A well." [...] Tasso relaxed. [...] "Then we'll find a well." [...] She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "We {{have about}} an hour, Major. Do {{you think we}} can find it in an hour?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} turns and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> She rises {{with an air}} of one who waits, and is almost {{at the end of her}} patience. She is a pretty girl, slender, fair, and {{intelligent}} looking, nicely but not expensively dressed, evidently not a smart idler.|$|R
60|$|After {{the little}} one was again hushed in slumber and cuddled in warm {{blankets}} on a seat beside them, the two imprisoned girls renewed their desultory conversation. They realized it must be long after midnight but Mildred avoided <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> because that made the minutes drag so slowly.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (rising and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch).</b> I {{shall be}} happy to see your friend at lunch, if you can persuade him to come; but I can't wait to see him now: I have an {{appointment}} at the hotel at a quarter to one with an old friend whom I have not seen since I left England eighteen years ago. Will you excuse me? ...|$|R
6000|$|As we {{went down}} {{the steps of the}} hotel Mrs. Colesworthy <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "It is twenty-five minutes to twelve," [...] she said. [...] "We must get home as fast as we can." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and was {{surprised}} to find how early it was. She could catch him at the office and make him take her out to lunch. She put on her hat and went out.|$|E
6000|$|Mildred <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> {{and found}} it was nearly four o’clock. With a little care in its {{administration}} the baby’s food might last until morning, but not longer. For themselves, they must be content without food, unless— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} is come after all," [...] said Miss Stanbury, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> Had the train arrived {{at the moment that}} it was due, had the {{expectant}} visitor jumped out of the railway carriage into a fly, and had the driver galloped up to the Close, it might have been possible that the wheels should have been at the door as Miss Stanbury spoke.|$|R
60|$|Madame de Rambouillet {{hesitated a}} little at the irreverence, but the Duke of Enghien {{requested}} that the sermon might take place, and she consented, only <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and saying it was near midnight, so that the time was short. M. Voiture, the poet, carried round a velvet bag, and each was to write a text on {{a slip of paper}} to be drawn out at haphazard.|$|R
60|$|I think, had {{the meal}} lasted much longer, I {{should have made}} a dash for the street; the contemplation of such step was forming in my mind. But Miss Sellars, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> {{declared}} we must be getting home at once, for the which I could have kissed her voluntarily; and, being a young lady of decision, at once rose and commenced leave-taking. Polite protests were attempted, but these, with enthusiastic assistance from myself, she swept aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you mustn't be in a hurry, mamma." [...] Mrs. Clavering <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and {{declaring that}} it still wanted three-quarters of an hour to dinner, promised {{that she would not}} be very much in a hurry.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and relapsed into silence. He {{clinched}} his hands, and writhed {{from side}} to side of his chair in an agony of indecision. Mrs. Lecount passively refused to take the slightest notice of him.|$|E
60|$|Again their unperceived {{companion}} made {{a gesture}} of vexation, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> as if time were precious. But the dialogue still flowed on upon this new subject, and {{showed no sign of}} returning to its old channel.|$|E
6000|$|... [CHLOE {{starts up}} from the sofa feverishly, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> [...] <b>watch,</b> <b>at</b> the window, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch; then softly crosses to the [...] window and opens it.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is half-past six now,' said Miss Linnet, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> as {{the servant}} {{appeared}} with the tea-tray. 'I suppose the delegates are come back by this time. If Mr. Tryan had not so kindly promised {{to call and}} let us know, I should hardly rest without walking to Milby myself to know what answer they have brought back. It is a great privilege for us, Mr. Tryan living at Mrs. Wagstaff's, for he is often able to take us on his way backwards and forwards into the town.' ...|$|R
60|$|Underneath the ivy-covered gateway {{she stood}} still and listened for two, or {{possibly}} three minutes, till she became conscious {{of others in}} the park. Seeing the pair she stepped back, with the apparent intention of letting them pass out of sight, and evidently wishing to avoid observation. But <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch,</b> and returning it rapidly to her pocket, as if surprised at the lateness of the hour, she hurried out again, and across the park by a still more oblique line than that traced by Owen and his sister.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman behind}} the hedge, who had still {{continued}} to dog their footsteps, made an impatient movement at this change in their conversation, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> again. Yet she seemed reluctant to give over listening to them.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} Cynthia and {{her friend}} and they pointed out the different wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, {{but after a few}} moments Cynthia called to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl {{shook her}} head, so Ernestine {{walked out into}} the street. Then she remembered Cecil Davenant and his strange manner--the story which he was even now waiting to tell her. She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and after a moment's {{hesitation}} called a hansom.|$|E
6000|$|The driver {{turned into}} the street in which Mr. Farnaby's house was situated. Mrs. Farnaby stopped him, and got out at some little {{distance}} from the door. [...] "You think the young ones will follow us back," [...] she said to Amelius. [...] "It doesn't matter, the servants will have nothing to tell them if they do." [...] She checked him {{in the act of}} knocking, when they reached the house door. [...] "It's tea-time downstairs," [...] she whispered, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "You and I are going into the house, without letting the servants know anything about it. Now do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{recovered}} herself {{sufficiently to}} be able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch</b> and to estimate the lapse of time that might yet pass before Julian returned to her as he had promised. While her mind was still languidly following this train of thought she was disturbed by the ringing of a bell in the hall, used to summon the servant whose duties were connected with that part of the house. In leaving the library, Horace had gone out by the door which led into the hall, and had failed to close it. She plainly heard the bell--and a moment later (more plainly still) she heard Lady Janet's voice! ...|$|R
60|$|Vauxhall Walk! Those {{two words}} told Mrs. Lecount {{she was on}} the brink of another discovery. She stole a second <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>watch.</b> There was barely ten minutes to spare before the time when Mr. Bygrave might return; there was not one of those ten minutes which might not bring his niece back to the house. Caution counseled Mrs. Lecount to go, without running any more risks. Curiosity rooted her to the spot, and gave the courage to stay at all hazards until the time was up. Her amiable smile began to harden a little as she probed her way tenderly into Mrs. Wragge's feeble mind.|$|R
