25|$|An {{important}} factor that distinguishes different radiation types {{from one another}} is the <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (LET), which is {{the rate at which}} the radiation loses energy with distance traveled through the absorber. Low LET species are usually low mass, either photons or electron mass species (β particles, positrons) and interact sparsely along their path through the absorber, leading to isolated regions of reactive radical species. High LET species are usually greater in mass than one electron, for example α particles, and lose energy rapidly resulting in a cluster of ionisation events in close proximity to one another. Consequently, the heavy particle travels a relatively short distance from its origin.|$|E
25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (<b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer)</b> {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E
25|$|Several {{experimental}} studies, {{which use}} heavy ion beams simulating space radiation, provide constructive {{evidence of the}} CNS risks from space radiation. First, exposure to HZE nuclei at low doses (<50 cGy) significantly induces neurocognitive deficits, such as learning and behavioral changes as well as operant reactions in the mouse and rat. Exposures to equal or higher doses of low-LET radiation (e.g., gamma or X rays) do not show similar effects. The threshold of performance deficit following exposure to HZE nuclei depends on both the physical characteristics of the particles, such as <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (LET), and the animal age at exposure. A performance deficit {{has been shown to}} occur at doses that are similar to the ones that will occur on a Mars mission (<0.5 Gy). The neurocognitive deficits with the dopaminergic nervous system are similar to aging and appear to be unique to space radiation. Second, exposure to HZE disrupts neurogenesis in mice at low doses (<1 Gy), showing a significant dose-related reduction of new neurons and oligodendrocytes in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Third, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal precursor cells arise following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons at low dose, and can persist for several months. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents can possibly reduce these changes. Fourth, neuroinflammation arises from the CNS following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons. In addition, age-related genetic changes increase the sensitivity of the CNS to radiation.|$|E

To understand the <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> that occur during {{the development of an}} extreme event we perform a spatially localized analysis of the energy distribution along different wavenumbers by means of the Gabor transform. A stochastic analysis of the Gabor coefficients reveals i) the low-dimensionality of the intermittent structures, ii) the interplay between non-Gaussian statis- tical properties and nonlinear <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> between modes, as well as iii) the critical scales (or critical Gabor coefficients) where a critical amount of energy can trigger the formation of an extreme event. We analyze the unstable character of these special localized modes directly through the system equation and show that these intermittent events are due to the interplay of the system nonlinearity, the wave dispersion, and the wave dissipation which mimics wave breaking. These localized instabilities are triggered by random localizations of energy in space, created by the dispersive propagation of low-amplitude waves with random phase. Based on these properties, we design low-dimensional functionals of these Gabor coefficients that allow for the prediction of the extreme event well before the nonlinear interactions begin to occur.

Deconvolution of kinetics is used to analyze the evolution of HO˙ track segment yields as a function of time and temperature. It takes care of involving the ionic strength effect and Arrhenius expression in the rate constants correction.

40|$|Introduction: Heavy ions are {{nucleus of}} {{elements}} of iron, argon, carbon and neon that all carry positive electrical charges. For these particles {{to be useful}} in radiotherapy they need to accelerated to high energy by more than thousand mega volts. Also the cosmic environment {{is considered to be}} a complicated mixture of highly energetic photons and heavy ions such as iron. Therefore, the health risks to astronauts during long mission should be considered.   Materials and Methods: The induction of interphase death was tested on Chinese hamster ovary cells by exposing them to accelerated heavy ions (carbon, neon, argon and iron) of 10 - 2000 <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> (LETs). The fraction of cells that underwent interphase death was determined by observing individual cells with time-lapse photography (direct method) as well as by the indirect method of counting cells undergoing interphase death made visible by the addition of caffeine (indirect method). Results: The interphase death due to the exposure to X- rays is increased linearly as the dose exceeds the threshold dose of 10 Gy. Whereas the interphase death increases at a higher rate due to the exposure to high LET heavy ions and no threshold dose was observed. The range of LET values corresponding to the maximum RBE for the interphase death is 120 - 230 keV/µm. The probability of inducing the interphase death by a single heavy ion traversing through the nucleus is about 0. 04 - 0. 08. Discussion and Conclusion: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of heavy ions as compared to X- rays as determined at the 50 % level of induction is increased with LET. It reached a maximum value at a LET of approximately 230 keV/µm and then decreased with further increase in LET. The range of LET values corresponding to the maximum RBE appears to be narrower for interphase death than for reproductive death...|$|R

40|$|Radiotherapy aims to {{sterilize}} cancer cells through ionization induced damages to their DNA whilst {{trying to reduce}} dose burdens to healthy tissues. This can be achieved {{to a certain extent}} by optimizing the choice of radiation to treat the patient, i. e. the types of particles and their energy based on their specific interaction patterns. In particular, the formation of complex clusters of energy deposits (EDs) increases with the <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> for a given particle. These differences cause variation in the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). The complexity of ED clusters might be related to complex forms of DNA damage, which are more difficult to repair and therefore prone to inactivate the cells. Hence, mapping of the number and complexity of ED clusters for different radiation qualities could aid to infer a surrogate measure substituting physical dose and LET as main predictors for the RBE.   In this work the spatial patterns of EDs at the nanometre scale were characterized for various energies of proton, helium, lithium and carbon ions. A track structure Monte Carlo code, LIonTrack, was developed to accurately simulate the light ion tracks in liquid water. The methods to emulate EDs at clinical dose levels in cell nucleus-sized targets for both 60 Co photons and light ions were established, and applied to liquid water targets. All EDs enclosed in such targets were analyzed with a specifically developed cluster algorithm where clustering was defined by a single parameter, the maximum distance between nearest neighbour EDs. When comparing measured RBE for different radiation qualities, there are cases for which RBE do not  increase with LET but instead increase with the frequencies of high order ED clusters. A test surrogate-measure based on ED cluster frequencies correlated to parameters of experimentally determined cell survival.

This could be obtained {{with the use of}} particles for radiation therapy. However, the radiation response of normal tissue stem cells is still an enigma. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a model to investigate the in vitro response of stem cells to particle irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used the immortalized human salivary gland (HSG) cell line resembling salivary gland (SG) cells to translate the radiation response in 2 -dimensional (2 D) to 3 -dimensional (3 D) conditions. This response was subsequently translated to the response of SG stem cells (SGSCs). Dispersed single cells were irradiated with photons or carbon ions at different <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> (LETs; 48. 76 ± 2. 16, 149. 9 ± 10. 8, and 189 ± 15 keV/μm). Subsequently, 2 D or 3 D clonogenicity was determined by counting the colonies or secondary stem cell-derived spheres in Matrigel. γH 2 AX immunostaining was used to assess DNA double strand break repair. RESULTS: The 2 D response of HSG cells showed a similar increase in dose response to increasing higher LET irradiation as other cell lines. The 3 D response of HSG cells to increasing LET irradiation was reduced compared with the 2 D response. Finally, the response of mouse SGSCs to photons was similar to the 3 D response of HSG cells. The response to higher LET irradiation was reduced in the stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse SGSC radiosensitivity seems reduced at higher LET radiation compared with transformed HSG cells. The developed model to assess the radiation response of SGSCs offers novel possibilities to study the radiation response of normal tissue in vitro...|$|R

The slowing down of these neutrons through elastic scattering produced recoil protons elastically of ~ 0. 5057, 0. 186, and 0. 0684 MeV which had <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> (LETs) of ~ 40, 67 and 76 keV/µm, respectively, at 25 °C. The effects of neutron radiation can be predicted based on the contribution of those first three recoil protons by neglecting the radiation effects due to oxygen ion recoils. Then, the fast neutron yields could be estimated by summing the yields of contributing protons after corresponding weightings were used according to their energy. In this work, yields were calculated at 10 - 7 and 10 - 6 s after incidence of neutron radiation in water at the aforementioned temperature range. Overall, there is a reasonably good agreement between our calculated and existing experimental G-values for the entire temperature range.

Therefore, it is essential to experimentally characterize the single event effects (SEE) of hardened and unhardened SRAM cells to determine their appropriate applications, especially when a low supply voltage is preferred. In this thesis, a SRAM test chip was designed and fabricated with four cell arrays sharing the same peripheral circuits, including two types of unhardened cells (standard 6 T and sub-threshold 10 T) and two types of hardened cells (Quatro and DICE). The systems for functional and radiation tests were built up with power supply voltages that ranged from near threshold 0. 4 V to normal supply 1 V.

Experimental results of the alpha test and heavy ion test were consistent with the results of the simulation. The cross sections of 6 T and 10 T cells present much more significant sensitivities than Quatro and DICE cells for all tested supply voltages and LET. The 10 T cell demonstrates a more optimal radiation performance than the 6 T cell when LET is small (0. 44 MeV·cm 2 /mg), yet no significant advantage is evident when LET is larger than this.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the photophysical properties of a number of fluorene molecules used for organic semiconductor lasers. These results are then combined with lasing results to assess what the important properties in an organic semiconductor laser material are. Photophysical measurements were performed on a family of oligofluorenes; results show a redshift in the peak absorption and emission wavelengths with increasing length. There is also an increase in the molar extinction coefficient and photoluminescence quantum yields of the molecules. Transition dipole moments also increase with length, but fluorescence scales slower than absorption due to self-trapping occurring at longer molecular lengths. This study was then expanded to two families of star-shaped molecules with fluorene arms and differing cores. These molecules have three arms connected to either a central benzene unit or a larger truxene core. These molecules show an increase in PLQY and roughly three times higher molar extinction coefficients than comparable linear oligofluorenes. The star-shaped molecules PLQY and transition dipole moments are both greater than their <b>linear</b> oligofluorene counterparts. <b>Energy</b> <b>transfer</b> was then studied in the truxene-cored molecules, which showed that the symmetry of the molecule was broken due to interactions with the solvent. <b>Energy</b> <b>transfer</b> was observed on two timescales; a fast 500 fs process which is attributed to a localisation onto a single arm to emit, and a 3 - 10 ps second decay component, and was assigned to resonant <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> between the arms. Both decays were found to be wavelength dependent. Lasing results were then obtained for the benzene cored molecules. It was found that star-shaped molecules present improved lasing characteristics with lower ASE and lasing thresholds. These results were compared with those obtained for truxene-cored molecules whose rigid core provides them with better lasing and ASE characteristics...|$|R
