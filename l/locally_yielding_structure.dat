40|$|A general {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the analysis}} of arching in soils {{as an extension of the}} conventional shear plane approach, in which the slip surfaces within the soil mass are considered as vertical planes. Such an assumption results in a low estimate of the design load on the <b>yielding</b> buried <b>structure</b> because of a considerable separation between the assumed vertical slip surfaces and the actual curved slip surfaces. The arching theory presented in this paper overcomes this limitation of the conventional theory by assuming inclined slip surfaces close to the actual slip surfaces. Based on this concept, an analytical expression for the vertical stress on the <b>yielding</b> <b>structure</b> is derived; a special case of this general expression reduces to the conventional expression. The variation of the vertical stress on the <b>yielding</b> <b>structure</b> with depth has been presented graphically along with a comparison with the conventional vertical shear plane approach. It is observed that the amount of arching increases with increase in the ratio of depth to width of the <b>yielding</b> <b>structure</b> as reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for generating a random {{process that has}} the pertinent properties of recorded strong-motion earthquake accelerograms. The model accelerograms are sections of a stationary, Gaussian, random process with a power spectral density found from the average undamped velocity spectrum. Eight pseudo-earthquakes of thirty seconds duration are generated on the digital computer and the velocities, displacements, and velocity spectra calculated. The average velocity spectra of the real and pseudo- earthquakes correspond closely and the velocities, displacements, and velocity spectra of the real and pseudo-earthquakes exhibit similar statistical behavior. It is concluded that the pseudo-earthquakes are satisfactory models of strong-motion earthquakes {{for the purposes of}} structural analysis. A general nonlinear hysteretic force-deflection relation for dynamic studies is presented. The relation is a continuous, smooth function and includes the linear and elasto-plastic relations as limiting cases. The steady-state response to sinusoidal excitation is studied in detail and the results presented. It is concluded that the hysteretic relation is general enough to be useful in structural analysis and that comparison of test results and theory may enable the dynamic force-deflection relations of real structures to be approximated. A class of <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> suitable for earthquake response studies is defined by the geometry of the hysteresis curves and the law describing yielding behavior. The general yielding relation is included in this class as are the linear, the elasto-plastic and the bilinear hysteretic relations. The equation of motion and the energy equation for the response of <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> to earthquake motion are examined and a typical <b>yielding</b> <b>structure</b> is subjected to the ensemble of pseudo-earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gravity on the {{earthquake}} response of one degree of freedom <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> is studied by subjecting them to earthquake-like excitation. Interest is centered on the time required for yielding to progress {{to the point of}} collapse. The results show that the {{effect of gravity}} is to increase significantly the development of permanent set over that occurring when gravity is ignored. Because the gravity effect increases as the deflection grows, the permanent set increases rapidly just prior to failure. A statistical study of the time to failure for elasto-plastic structures indicates that the average time to failure is inversely proportional to the square of the ratio of the earthquake strength to the lateral yield level of the structure, implying that an earthquake of short duration would have to possess significantly higher accelerations than a longer earthquake in order to cause failure of a given structure. It was found that for the range of periods considered the average time to collapse for the <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> was independent of period. For the bilinear hysteretic structure the results show a large increase in the time of failure when the second slope increases from zero. Calculations made with simultaneous vertical and horizontal excitation, and with recorded strong earthquake accelerograms, indicate that the thesis results, obtained from artificial earthquakes, should be applicable for strong earthquake excitation. Comparison of the results with those of a one-dimensional random walk indicates that on the average a <b>yielding</b> <b>structure</b> will collapse after the input of a certain amount of energy...|$|R

Polarized light microscopy showed substantial local matrix yielding near the fibre-matrix interface {{in the case of}} good fibre-matrix adhesion. The level of fibre surface treatment proved to have a large influence on both the final fragment length distribution and the debonded length. The experimental fragment length distributions were compared to predicted fragment length distributions resulting from a numerical simulation of the fibre fragmentation test, based on stress transfer through a yielding matrix and frictional shear stress. Good agreement between the experimental results and the predictions was observed for the case of little debonding. Because of the observed stress transfer through a <b>locally</b> <b>yielding</b> matrix, the classical stress transfer theories for the fibre fragmentation test do not determine a realistic value for the strength of the fibre-matrix interface...|$|R

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to study {{the influence of the}} shear yield stress of the matrix on the stress situation in carbon/epoxy model composites containing a planar fibre array. The fibre used was a surface-treated high-modulus Tenax® HMS- 40 carbon fibre showing good fibre/matrix adhesion. Three matrices were used, all consisting of a common epoxy resin and a mixture of a di-functional and a tri-functional aliphatic amine-based curing agent. By varying the ratio of the di-functional to the tri-functional curing agent, the shear yield stress of the matrix was varied. For all three matrices, it was found that in the area immediately neighbouring a fibre fracture, stress transfer takes place through a <b>locally</b> <b>yielding</b> matrix. More importantly, it was shown that the maximum interfacial shear stress approximately equals the shear yield stress of the bulk matrix. In addition, it was found that an increase in the shear yield stress of the matrix results in a decrease of both the ineffective length and the positively affected length. Further, the experimental results show that the shear yield stress of the matrix does not significantly influence the stress concentration in the fibres adjacent to a broken fibre...|$|R

This duration can be described by an exponential function of magnitude for 2. 5 < M < 7. 5. It is related to the times it takes the dislocation to spread over the fault width (1 /f 2), and the fault length (- 1 / f,), and to reach its ultimate amplitude (To). The results in this paper can be used to estimate the range of amplitudes and the duration of long period pulses of strong ground motion near faults, as these long period pulses can be related to the properties of high-frequency radiation from the source.

40|$|A novel scaling {{algorithm}} {{for ground}} motion accelerograms (GMs) is proposed {{in support of}} incremental dynamic analysis used to establish dependable statistical relationships between scalable intensity measures (IMs) and engineering demand parameters (EDPs) within a performance based earthquake engineering framework. Specifically, an iterative harmonic wavelet based scheme is employed to accomplish “surgical ” changes to the spectral shape of suites of GMs to span various pre-defined levels of the spectral acceleration at the structural fundamental natural period, the most widely adopted IM. Since the target IM values may not be accomplished precisely by the local spectral modifications, a second step involving global uniform GM scaling is further considered. The proposed algorithm requires significantly smaller global (amplitude) scaling factors compared to the currently used scaling approach in which no initial local GM modification is undertaken. A numerical application of the proposed algorithm to elastoplastic structural systems shows {{the extent to which}} spectral shape may influence the displacement response of <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> and explains the conservative bias introduced by uniform global scaling...|$|R

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient harmonic wavelet-based {{iterative procedure}} is proposed to modify suites of recorded accelerograms {{to be used}} in the aseismic design of critical structures regulated by the European code provisions (EC 8). Special attention is focused on assessing the potential of appropriately defined orthogonal harmonic wavelet basis functions to derive design spectrum compatible time-histories which preserve the non-stationary characteristics of the original recorded signals. This is a quite desirable attribute in the practice of the aseismic design of <b>yielding</b> <b>structures.</b> In this regard, seven recorded accelerograms recommended for the design of base-isolated structures are modified via the proposed procedure and base-line adjusted to meet the pertinent EC 8 compatibility criteria.

A few methods have been proposed to recover some of the missing information in limited-angle tomography, for example, by using convex projections (Carazo and Carrascosa 1987). Recently, the reconstruction method proposed by Chen and Förster (2014) was shown to restore some of the missing information by iterative extrapolation. Total variation minimization (TMV, or “regularization”) based on compressed sensing (CS) (Donoho 2006) has been applied successfully to ET in material sciences, <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> with minimal missing wedge artifacts and improved contrast (Saghi et al. 2011; Goris et al. 2012; Leary et al. 2013). Variations of this method have also been demonstrated for cryoET specimens (Aganj et al. 2007; Song et al. 2012). Recently, the iterative compressed-sensing optimized non-uniform (ICON) reconstruction (Deng et al. 2016) method demonstrated that CS can restore missing information in noisy cryoET data of both cells and isolated macromolecules, thereby minimizing missing wedge artifacts and yielding measurably better reconstructions than WBP.|$|R

Three different chip structures were probed {{with the use of}} electron diffraction pattern: (i) totally amorphous lamellar structure, (ii) amorphous structure with remnant crystalline material and, (iii) partially amorphous together with amorphous with remnant crystalline material. Furthermore, micro-Raman spectroscopy from the chips left in the cutting tool rake face showed different silicon phases. We have found, from a detailed analysis of the debris, five different structural phases of silicon in the same debris.

Shearing results from structural changes related to phase transformation induced by pressure and shear deformation. Extrusion, <b>yielding</b> crystalline <b>structures</b> in the chips, may be attributed to a pressure drop (due to an increase in the contact area) from the tool tip towards the region of the cutting edge where brittle-to-ductile transition occurs.

The method involves the deposition of a thin (about 10 nm) metal layer, in the desired pattern, on a substrate before the deposition of the superconducting thin film. During growth the metal reacts with the YBCO, forming locally an insulating compound. Best results are obtained with Ti or W, <b>yielding</b> <b>structures</b> with sharp boundaries and creating insulating areas with high resistivities. The technique has been analysed for the titanium case. It was found that during the YBCO growth the titanium layer reacts with the YBCO to form an amorphous Ba-Ti-O compound.

The resistivity of the insulating parts has been investigated {{as a function of the}} layer thicknesses of both the titanium and the YBCO.
