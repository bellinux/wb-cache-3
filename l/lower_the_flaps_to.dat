2500|$|Before landing, {{the pilot}} {{would open the}} BLC vents as well as <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> achieve slow, stable flight. [...] A {{consequence}} of the blown wing was that the engines were required to run at high power for low-speed flight; in order to generate sufficient compressor gas for blowing. [...] Blackburn's solution to this situation was {{the adoption of a}} large air brake; this also allowed an overshooting aircraft to pull away more quickly during a failed landing attempt. [...] The nose cone and radar antenna could also be swung around by 180degrees to reduce the length of the aircraft in the carrier hangar. [...] This feature was particularly important due to the small size of the aircraft carriers that the Buccaneer typically operated from.|$|E
5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> reduce speed and shorten his turn radius, {{rather than the}} standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reluctance}} {{to declare a}} missed approach pervaded the descent. Radar controller, captain, first officer and flight engineer all had indications of an {{out of the ordinary}} approach, producing a rushed and busy environment. An example of this that the captain failed to <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> landing gear immediately after <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> 25 degrees, because he [...] "wanted to avoid placing a simultaneous demand on the hydraulic system while <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were in transit". Similarly, the first officer never made the required 1,000-ft callout, because he never got to 1,000 ft mentally, because his [...] "inner time clock" [...] which was based on a normal descent rate. In addition, each person chose not to ask for or offer additional assistance or warnings, including recommended announcements and acknowledgments. The lack of crew communication and a [...] "no problem here" [...] attitude resulted in false awareness of altitude and descent rate on the part of all involved.|$|R
50|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> reduce speed and shorten his turn radius, {{rather than the}} standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.Emil Clade said {{that none of the}} other pilots could do this effectively, preferring instead to dive on single opponents at speed so as to escape if anything went wrong. Clade said of Marseille's tactics:Marseille developed his own special tactics, which differed significantly from the methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even took it {{to the point where he}} had to operate his landing <b>flaps</b> as not <b>to</b> fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|R
2500|$|American Airlines Flight 1572 (12 November 1995) – The crew {{incorrectly}} set the altimeter on {{approach to}} Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, {{so they were}} flying 70 feet lower than they thought they were. This led to them crashing into the treetops {{as they tried to}} perform a night landing. The engines ingested the trees and failed, so <b>the</b> pilots <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> 40 degrees <b>to</b> create a [...] "wing in ground effect", which enabled them {{to make it to the}} runway and land with no casualties.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{for both}} the Shuttle and the HL-42, as the {{airspeed}} dropped below Mach 3.5 with denser air and a lower angle of attack, the rudder would begin to meet the airflow and take over yaw control from the RCS. From here until landing the HL-42 would behave more like a normal aircraft, controlled mainly by elevons and rudder, with some roll control from <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> body <b>flaps.</b> At <b>lower</b> speeds <b>the</b> upper body <b>flaps,</b> moving together, could also assist the elevons in controlling pitch (at higher speeds they {{would be out of}} the airflow and ineffective). After touchdown <b>the</b> upper body <b>flaps</b> would be extended together with <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> body <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> serve as air-brakes.|$|R
50|$|The SM.89 was {{intended}} to be a bomber/attack aircraft, something similar to Junkers Ju 88. The aircraft displayed some impressive features, {{but it was not a}} new project, rather an extrapolation from the earlier SM.84. The project utilized the wings, the aft fuselage and the mixed construction of the latter almost untouched, with a totally redesigned nose. The fuselage was made from a skeleton of steel tubes, covered with duralumin and wood back as far as the dorsal turret, the remainder of the fuselage being of wood and fabric construction. The wing was made of wood using three spars and a covering of compensate wood. The control surfaces comprised slats and <b>flaps,</b> and <b>the</b> ailerons, that were <b>lowered</b> partially with <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> increase lift.|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of post-radiation wound breakdown over the posterior cervico thoracic region {{can be a}} challenging task for a surgeon. The {{aim of the treatment}} is to produce a well vascularized and a low tensile flap which will close a large defect. We describe the use of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> trapezius <b>flap</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct <b>the</b> wound breakdown and to obtain stable tissue coverage in a patient with postradiation necrosis. This <b>flap</b> minimizes <b>the</b> disruption of the scapula-thoracic function while preserving the range of movement over the shoulder. From the literature review, it was noted that the dorsal scapular artery (DSA) and transverse cervical artery (TCA) aid in the blood supply to the trapezius muscle and prevent local necrosis during rotation of <b>the</b> <b>flap.</b> <b>The</b> trapezius <b>flap</b> is widely accepted because of the minor donor site morbidity, large arc of rotation and adequate blood supply...|$|R
40|$|Low Reynolds number {{airfoils}} {{have become}} of interest recently for applications on Micro-air Vehicles (MAVs). Airfoils at low Reynolds numbers and high angles of attack {{are known to}} be unstable due to low lift to drag ratios. This study investigates the effect of a movable leading edge <b>flap</b> on <b>the</b> lift <b>to</b> drag ratio of an airfoil for use on MAVs. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is used to fully resolve the flow around a thin airfoil at high angles of attack. The airfoil is represented numerically using a fictitious domain approach and assuming two-dimensional flow. The solver is validated using the standard case of a cylinder in cross-flow. Preliminary experimental data for the lift of the airfoil compares well with the numerical results for two angles of attack. Cases were run at a Reynolds number of 14, 700 and an angle of attack of 20 degrees to study the effect of <b>the</b> front <b>flap</b> at a static angle and the effect of an oscillating front <b>flap.</b> <b>Lowering</b> <b>the</b> front <b>flap</b> <b>to</b> an angle of 20 degrees increased the lift to drag ratio to 5. 84 compared to 2. 47 for <b>the</b> no <b>flap</b> case. Cases with a moving front flap were run at 1, 3, and 5 Hz. <b>The</b> <b>flapping</b> motion caused <b>the</b> time-varying lift coefficient to become more predictable and periodic. The presence of lift and drag fluctuations is found to depend on how vortices are shed from {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil...|$|R
50|$|The captain {{recognized}} Curles Neck Farm, {{selected the}} largest field, and landed straight ahead with <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> up and <b>the</b> landing gear retracted. He felt it inadvisable {{to make any}} turn, <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps,</b> or otherwise <b>to</b> change the flight configuration, since {{the cause of the}} severe buffeting was unknown. During the last few moments of flight, as the nose of the aircraft touched high corn in a field, the copilot and flight engineer cut all switches. A power line pole {{at the edge of the}} corn field was struck by the right wing as the aircraft passed under the wires. After passing over Curles Neck Road, a section of fence was torn down and the aircraft skidded 1,100 feet through a field, another fence, and finally came to rest in a pasture 265 feet from the second fence at 15:59. A localized fire developed outside of the No 4 engine, but was quickly extinguished by rain and the local fire department who arrived at the scene within a short time.|$|R

50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust over <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} lift {{beyond that}} attainable with mechanical <b>flaps.</b> Types include <b>the</b> original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>flap,</b> <b>the</b> externally blown <b>flap,</b> which blows engine exhaust over <b>the</b> upper and <b>lower</b> surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>flap,</b> and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust over the top of <b>the</b> wing and <b>flap.</b> While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown <b>flaps</b> wasn't until <b>the</b> 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar.

5000|$|The pilot {{probably}} {{tried to}} overshoot and set <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct 10 degrees, {{but due to}} the mechanism design this was not sufficient <b>to</b> cause <b>the</b> starboard <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event).

50|$|It was a {{high wing}} aircraft; the wing had {{constant}} chord out to rounded tips and had a wooden structure with plywood skinning. The Villiers XXIV {{had been the first}} French aircraft maker to use Handley Page slats and the Villiers 26 reconnaissance seaplane used a combination of automatically opening slats on the leading edge in front of the ailerons and another set which the pilot opened as he <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> <b>flaps.</b> <b>The</b> Type 31 had a similar combination of automatic and commanded slats.|$|R
50|$|After First Officer Davtyan {{extended}} <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>to</b> full, {{few seconds}} later, the master warning sounded, {{and continued to}} do so {{until the end of}} the recording. The speed at the time was too fast, which could tear <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> apart and could cause the plane to crash, similar to Austral Lineas Aereas Flight 2553. The plane was banking to the right. Flight 967 began a nose-down attitude and <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> then retracted <b>to</b> 18°. Captain Grigoryan then made an 11° nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.|$|R
50|$|At {{first it}} was {{classified}} as a Standard Class glider, which at <b>the</b> time allowed <b>flaps</b> instead of air-brakes for approach control.

50|$|In the 1970s, Hogan and Shprintzen {{advanced}} posterior pharyngeal <b>flaps,</b> leading <b>to</b> {{an increased}} success {{rate in the}} elimination of VPI.

In this flap, lateral ports exist {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> pharyngeal <b>flap</b> <b>to</b> assist in drainage, nasal breathing, and nasal resonance. Using the pressure-flow studies of Warren and colleagues as a basis for lateral port size, Hogan placed a 4 mm diameter catheter through the lateral ports on either side of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> <b>to</b> tailor <b>the</b> port size to the perception of nasal resonance (Sloan, 2000). Consistent with Warren’s aerodynamic data, Hogan advocated that the velopharyngeal opening be no greater than 4 mm in diameter because a larger gap would most likely result in hypernasal speech (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001).|$|R
