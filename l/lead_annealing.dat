Electrostatic instability at the polar surface of WO 3 (001) is avoided by termination of the outer WO 2 layer with half a monolayer of oxygen ions to produce a (√ 2 × √ 2) R 45 ° arrangement of on-top oxygen. An additional periodicity is introduced in some terrace areas by tilting of WO 6 octahedra to produce alternately long and short on-top O-O separations along the [110] direction. This produces a (2 × 2) superstructure approximating to the space group c 2 mm. Prominent defect troughs on oxygen annealed surfaces are attributed to missing oxygen ions.
