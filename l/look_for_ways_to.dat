500|$|Several {{film and}} {{entertainment}} critics have noted similarities and {{parallels between the}} stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists. [...] Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and {{came as a surprise}} to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. [...] According to Hahn, [...] "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet.

500|$|One of {{the goals}} of current {{research}} in string theory is to develop models in which the strings represent particles observed in high energy physics experiments. For such a model to be consistent with observations, its spacetime must be four-dimensional at the relevant distance scales, so one must <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> restrict the extra dimensions to smaller scales. In most realistic models of physics based on string theory, this is accomplished by a process called compactification, in which the extra dimensions are assumed to [...] "close up" [...] on themselves to form circles. In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling {{on the surface of the}} hose would move in two dimensions.|$|E

The 2nd Duke had spent heavily on artworks, womanising, and attempting to influence elections, and by 1847 he was nicknamed [...] "the Greatest Debtor in the World". Over [...] of the family's [...] estates, and their London home at Buckingham House, were sold to meet debts, and the family seat of Stowe House was seized by bailiffs as security and its contents sold. The only property remaining in the control of the Grenville family was the family's relatively small ancestral home of Wotton House, and its associated lands around Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire. Deeply in debt, the Grenvilles began to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> maximise profits from their remaining farmland around Wotton, and to seek business opportunities in the emerging fields of heavy industry and engineering. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, who became the Marquess of Chandos on the death of his grandfather Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839, was appointed chairman of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 27May1857. On the death of his father on 29July1861 he became the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from the chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family's remaining estates.|$|E

Further exacerbating the problem (and unlike kidney, liver, and heart transplants, where only one donor is needed for each recipient) most islet transplant patients require islets from two or more donors to achieve euglycemia. Lastly, the current methods for islet isolation need improvement, since only about half of attempted isolations produce transplant-ready islets.|$|E
