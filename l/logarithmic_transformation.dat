50|$|The {{technique}} is often performed {{in cases where}} {{it is easier to}} differentiate the logarithm of a function rather than the function itself. This usually occurs in cases where the function of interest is composed of a product of a number of parts, so that a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>transformation</b> will turn it into a sum of separate parts (which is much easier to differentiate). It can also be useful when applied to functions raised to the power of variables or functions. Logarithmic differentiation relies on the chain rule as well as properties of logarithms (in particular, the natural logarithm, or the logarithm to the base e) to transform products into sums and divisions into subtractions. The principle can be implemented, at least in part, in the differentiation of almost all differentiable functions, providing that these functions are non-zero.|$|E

40|$|Microwave image {{reconstruction}} {{is typically}} {{based on a}} regularized least-square minimization of either the complex-valued field difference between recorded and modeled data or the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>transformation</b> of these field differences. Prior work has shown anecdotally that the latter outperforms the former in limited surveys of simulated and experimental phantom results. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation of these empirical findings by developing closed form solutions for {{the field and the}} inverted electromagnetic property parameters in one dimension which reveal the dependency of the estimated permittivity and conductivity on the absolute (unwrapped) phase of the measured signal at the receivers relative to the source transmission. The analysis predicts the poor performance of complex-valued field minimization as target size and/or frequency and electromagnetic contrast increase. Such poor performance is avoided by <b>logarithmic</b> <b>transformation</b> and preservation of absolute measured signal phase. Two-dimensional experiments based on both synthetic and clinical data are used to confirm these findings. Robustness of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>transformation</b> to variation in the initial guess of the reconstructed target properties is also shown. The results are generalizable to three dimensions and indicate that the minimization form with <b>logarithmic</b> <b>transformation</b> offers image reconstruction performance characteristics that are much more desirable for medial microwave imaging applications relative to minimizing differences in complex-valued field quantities...|$|E
