40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{recommend}} a rapid classification system for sustainable flood retention basins (SFRBs) to control runoff in a temperate climate.

Particular emphasis is given towards vegetated retention basins in Baden (Germany). The most important groups of variables were of engineering, environmental {{and land use}} nature. The classification methodology {{can be used by}} urban and landscape planners to determine the type of Sustainable Flood Retention Basin based on a total sum of weights obtained for 34 qualitative or quantitative variables.

The methodology was developed with a general database (approximately 460 basins) and a very detailed database (24 basins). Most of the thoroughly researched SFRB of the latter database are Traditional Sustainable Flood Retention Basins.

This chapter also discusses the GPS measurements and the sieve analysis of the beach sand. In chapter 4 the wave measurements are discussed. Some measurements on the wave height and wave period and length were done. The results have been checked to see if the waves were Gauss distributed and if the data were reliable. There is also something told about the groyne measurements in chapter 5. In order to get a view on the stability and change in volume some results of measurements are discussed.

40|$|International audienceAt {{the scale}} of a river reach, the {{dynamics}} of the river bed is typically modelled by Exner equation (conservation of the solid mass) with an empirical solid flux of transported sediments, which is a simple deterministic algebraic formula function of i) the sediment physical characteristics (size and mass) and of ii) the averaged hydrodynamical description of the ambient water flow. This model has proved useful, in particular through numerical simulations, <b>for</b> <b>hydraulic</b> engineering <b>purposes</b> (like estimating the mass of sediments that is drained through an open dam). Though, the model is also coarse. And its applicability at various space and time scales remains a question of considerable interest for sedimentologists.

This work is a preliminary study of the coupling of a stochastic Exner equation with a hydrody-namical model for large scales.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study fluid flow in {{fractures}} using numerical simulation {{and address the}} challenging issue of hydraulic property characterization in fractures. The methodology is based on Computational Fluid Dynamics, using a finite-volume based discretization scheme. Steady-state, viscous, laminar flow simulations for a Newtonian fluid are carried out in both 2 D and 3 D fracture models. In 2 D, flow is analyzed in single fractures, series and parallel combination of fractures, inclined fractures, intersecting fractures, mixed networks, and in real (rough-surface) fractures. In 3 D, flow is simulated in both uniform and variable aperture fracture models. To characterize each fracture model with an equivalent hydraulic aperture, equations are derived for all possible scenarios followed by comparison and validation with results derived from flow simulation. Based on the fracture models analyzed, the following {{are some of the}} important findings: 1) For fractures connected in series, the equivalent hydraulic aperture is a weighted harmonic mean of cubed apertures of all fractures. 2) For fractures connected in parallel, the equivalent flow is simply the sum of all flows through individual fractures. 3) If a fracture is inclined with respect to the axis of pressure gradient, then the amount of flow will be reduced by a factor of cosine of the inclination angle. 4) Any network of randomly intersecting fractures can be replaced by a single fracture to give flow equivalence; the aperture of that equivalent fracture will roughly be close to the aperture of the fracture in the network that cuts across the boundaries (inlet and outlet) in the most continuous fashion and have the smallest inclination (with respect to the pressure gradient axis). 5) <b>For</b> <b>hydraulic</b> characterization <b>purposes,</b> fluid flow in fractures can be sufficiently modeled using both Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations for flow Reynolds number upto approximately 100...|$|R

The scheme delivers approximately 10 000 ML of water annually to a land district of 10 000 ha. The scheme consists of mostly open, earth lined channels, with sections of concrete lined channel, pipeline, culverts, drop pipes, and siphons or drop siphons where required <b>for</b> <b>hydraulic</b> design <b>purposes</b> or to provide road access and crossings. The system consists of over 100 km of channel and pipe, in a network of 17 distinct channel sections. The full system and its subcomponents have been modelled, using the generally available package, HEC-RAS, to model open channel sections, approximate pipe performance and to model the network operation under various scenarios. The performance of pipe and culvert sections was independently checked using spreadsheet analysis. The objective of the analysis {{was to determine the}} maximum capacity of the system in its current state; determine restrictions to the flow of water through the network; and to identify strategies to increase the capacity to deliver water by at least 30 %. The key restraints on the analysis were to ensure that any increased volume of water carried into the network could be safely discharged out of the network to adjoining natural watercourses in the event that irrigation was suddenly stopped and/or water input to the system increased, for example {{in the event of a}} sudden rainstorm. It was found that the system was currently underutilised, and that in most cases the culverts were capable of running full, which greatly increased the possible flow rates allowable in the system.

The authors also provide data on the earlier studies of the effect produced by domestic superplasticizers on the plasticity of fine-grained concrete mixtures and the curing behaviour of plasticized fine concretes. Russian-made superplasticizer Khimkom F 1 was used to retain the plasticity of the fine concrete under consideration. Khimkom F 1 produces a better effect on concrete curing than Polyplast SP- 1, Cemactive SU- 1, and Linomix SP 180 - 2. Superplasticizer Khimkom F 1, as opposed to plasticizers based on lingo-sulfonate or naphthalene, for example S- 3, has no bad odour; it is non-corrosive if applied to steel reinforcement inside concrete. The research has proved that the optimal amount of Khimkom F 1 is 1. 2 % of the total amount of the binder. Metakaolin fume was used to improve the microstructure of the concrete, including its strength, waterand frost-resistance. Improvement of the above properties was proved {{in the course of the}} experiment. Its optimal content equals to 15 % of the total amount of the binder. The study of the two domestically made water repellents (Sofexil 40 and Sofexil 60 - 80) was conducted to identify and to compare their water and frost resistance.

25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow. This incompressible nature makes a <b>liquid</b> suitable <b>for</b> transmitting <b>hydraulic</b> power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|R
