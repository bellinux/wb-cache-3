50|$|The Paigah tombs is {{near to the}} Dargah of Barhana Shah Sahab {{are very}} {{delicate}} and splendor works of art in Mughal Provinces Style. Though these stunning tombs are strewn over 35-40 acres, tombs of the Paigah as who had married daughters of the Nizams and their spouses are confined to a two-acre site. It is this enclosure which {{is now known as}} Paigah tombs., are in the shape of chaukhandis with <b>latticed</b> <b>panels</b> but open to sky. As all the Nizam's tombs till the ascending to the throne by 7th Nizams were exposed to sky, to emulate the tomb of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb, of whom the Nizam were the governor. So the Paigah nobles preferred their graves to be without any roof. It is as per the simple tenets of Islam. The surrounding beautiful structure of walls have <b>latticed</b> <b>panels</b> with geometrical and floral design. The delicate polished stucco work and Jali is art is tic which represents the general style of the period.|$|R
60|$|Red-brick walls harmoniously {{toned down}} in colour by time, strong-rooted ivy, <b>latticed</b> windows, <b>panelled</b> rooms, big oaken beams in little places, and stone-walled gardens where annual fruit yet ripened upon monkish trees, were the {{principal}} surroundings of pretty old Mrs. Crisparkle and the Reverend Septimus {{as they sat}} at breakfast.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{verandah}} has been enclosed {{at the southern}} end with glass louvres, and glass louvres and <b>latticed</b> timber <b>panels</b> frame the stair and form entrance screens to the two first floor flats. French doors open onto the verandah, and the northern end has timber slat blinds and a fibrous cement sheeted room with a corrugated iron hipped roof and a sash window with a timber batten and corrugated iron hood. The room abuts the northern boundary wall which has quoining to the Quay Street frontage.|$|R
50|$|A wide {{entrance}} stair, with rendered masonry upstands {{to either}} side, is located centrally. Non-original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are {{located at the}} top of the stair, the verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and <b>latticed</b> timber <b>panels</b> are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end of the roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from the first floor of the rear wing is located adjacent to the gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} address the {{performance}} complexity of the various constituent materials of (dense-column) <b>latticed</b> concrete-gypsum composite <b>panels</b> and the difficulty in {{the determination of the}} various elastic constants, this paper presented a detailed structural analysis of the (dense-column) <b>latticed</b> concrete-gypsum composite <b>panel</b> and proposed a feasible technical solution to simplified calculation. In conformity with mechanical rules, a typical panel element was selected and divided into two homogenous composite sub-elements and a secondary homogenous element, respectively for solution, thus establishing an equivalence of the composite panel to a simple homogenous panel and obtaining the effective formulas for calculating the various elastic constants. Finally, the calculation results and the experimental results were compared, which revealed that the calculation method was correct and reliable and could meet the calculation needs of practical engineering and provide a theoretical basis for simplified calculation for studies on composite panel elements and structures as well as a reference for calculations of other panels...|$|R
50|$|A {{storage shed}} is located {{to the east}} of Lochiel at the {{northern}} end of the lawn. The shed has a gable roof with ribbed pan and corrugated iron sheeting and chamferboard walls. The southern gable has decorative timber bargeboards surmounting a gabled porch with <b>latticed</b> timber gable <b>panel</b> and decorative timber detailing. Lean-to structures {{have been added to the}} sides and rear of this building.|$|R
50|$|The 1937 {{building}} is clad with weatherboards {{and has a}} hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The understorey is enclosed with corrugated metal sheeting. The windows on both levels are timber- framed casements or double-hung sashes, both with fanlights and original hardware. Some windows are sheltered by large timber awnings with timber brackets and battened cheeks. Two projecting stove recesses are on the northern side. Timber stairs provide access to the upper level {{as well as to}} the connecting walkway linking the two building parts. The walls and ceilings of the upper level are lined with v-jointed, tongue-and-groove boards with moulded architraves and timber splay skirtings. It has high-waisted, panelled timber doors with fanlights and original hardware. The main room has a <b>latticed</b> ventilation <b>panel</b> in the ceiling and in 2012 the building houses various items of early school furniture and school equipment.|$|R
50|$|An {{entrance}} to the rear lean-to, with a corrugated iron hood with curved timber brackets, {{is located on the}} western side. A porch with decorative timber detailing protects a second entrance located mid-way along the western elevation (this entrance was possibly originally a bay window). The porch has a gable roof with <b>latticed</b> timber gable <b>panel</b> and balustrade, curved valance and paired timber posts with cross-bracing. A continuous window hood surmounts several non-original casement windows, and two dormer windows with arched leadlight panels are located on the western side of the roof.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "museum" [...] wing is {{constructed}} of chamferboard {{and has a}} corrugated iron gable roof and is supported by brick piers with <b>latticed</b> timber infill <b>panels.</b> The southern elevation is highly decorative, with a central bay window flanked by non-original casement windows (with a corner window unit to the southwest corner) and surmounted by timber detailing to the gable. The bay has narrow sash windows with etched and coloured glass panes and timber shutters. The bay is crowned by a timber valance consisting of triple curved sections, and paired lancet windows with leadlight panels {{are located in the}} gable above. The gable has a metal finial, and a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim supported by curved timber brackets. A non original door is located on {{the eastern side of the}} bay and is accessed via a timber stair.|$|R
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type C/T2, Block C retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} early Department of Public Works design. It is a high-set, timber-framed building with a northern and southern verandah and a gable roof. Four sets of timber stairs provide access to the verandahs and the northern verandah is connected to Block D to the east. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. Both the gable end walls have a panel of ventilating weatherboards. The verandah walls are single-skin, lined internally, with chamfered stud framing exposed externally. The verandah walls have a ventilation flap at floor level and retain original double leaf doors with pivoting fanlights. The southern verandah retains a hat room enclosure at its southern end. The interior is partitioned into two rooms connected by a large opening; this partition is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. The ceiling is coved and has a <b>latticed</b> ventilation <b>panel.</b> Timber tie beams at cornice level are exposed in the space. The fenestration pattern remains intact with windows only in the eastern and western walls sheltered by original timber hoods with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The northern verandah is enclosed at the western end. A small teacher's room projects from both verandahs. A small enclosure of the northern verandah accommodates a store room that is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
