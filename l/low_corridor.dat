40|$|Corridors are {{frequently}} proposed to connect patches of habitat {{that have become}} isolated due to human‐mediated alterations to the landscape. While it is understood that corridors can facilitate dispersal between patches, it remains unknown whether corridors can mitigate the negative genetic effects for entire communities modified by habitat fragmentation. These negative genetic effects, which include reduced genetic diversity, limit the potential for populations to respond to selective agents such as disease epidemics and global climate change. We provide clear evidence from a forward‐time, agent‐based model (ABM) that corridors can facilitate genetic resilience in fragmented habitats across {{a broad range of}} species dispersal abilities and population sizes. Our results demonstrate that even modest increases in corridor width decreased the genetic differentiation between patches and increased the genetic diversity and effective population size within patches. Furthermore, we document a trade‐off between corridor quality and corridor design whereby populations connected by high‐quality habitat (i. e., <b>low</b> <b>corridor</b> mortality) are more resilient to suboptimal corridor design (e. g., long and narrow corridors). The ABM also revealed that species interactions can play a greater role than corridor design in shaping the genetic responses of populations to corridors. These results demonstrate how corridors can provide long‐term conservation benefits that extend beyond targeted taxa and scale up to entire communities irrespective of species dispersal abilities or population sizes...|$|E

40|$|Small mammals in {{heterogeneous}} environments {{have been}} found to disperse along corridors connecting habitat patches. Corridors may have different survivability values depending on their size and the degree of cover they provide. This deterministic model tests the effects of varying corridor quality on the demographics of a metapopulation of Peromyscus leucopus. Two types of corridors are defined based on the probability of survival during a dispersal event. Results indicate that mortality during movement through corridors influences metapopulation demographics. We found that: 1. Any connection between two isolated patches is better than no connection at all in terms of persistence and population size at equilibrium. 2. Metapopulations with exclusively high quality corridors between patches have a larger population size at equilibrium than do those with one or more <b>low</b> quality <b>corridors.</b> 3. Increasing the number of high quality corridors between patches has a positive effect {{on the size of the}} metapopulation while increasing the number of <b>low</b> quality <b>corridors</b> has a negative effect. 4. The addition to a metapopulation of a patch connected by <b>low</b> quality <b>corridors</b> has a negative effect on the metapopulation size. This suggest the need for caution in planning corridors in a managed landscape. 5. There is no relationship between the number of corridors and the metapopulation size at equilibrium-when the number of connected patches is held constant. 6. Geometrically isolated patches connected by <b>low</b> quality <b>corridors</b> are most vulnerable to local extinctions. We conclude that corridor quality is an important element of connectivity.

The obtained data set of well-located hypocentres allowed us to define some previouslyunknown, or only poorly-defined, geometric characteristics. We also confirmed, with a finer detail, some already-known first order features such as the presence of two NW-SE-trending zones of seismicity, west and east of the Apennine water divide, separated by a <b>low</b> seismicity <b>corridor.</b> The main findings of this study are: 1) most of the seismicity of the western zone is located in the Lunigiana graben, north-NW of the Apuane Alps; 2) at depth, the Lunigiana seismicity deepens to the east parallel {{to the top of the}} basement, which in turn coincides with an extensional detachment (~ 30 ° E-dipping); and 3) the Lunigiana seismicity terminates southwards with a dense cluster of epicentres oriented nearly E-W, parallel to the transfer fault zone that delimits the Apuane Alps to the north; south of this cluster, a strong reduction of seismicity is observed and the locations are shifted to the eastern sector.

Modeling results suggest that in a landscape of dispersed natural patches and corridors, by far the greatest road effect (ecological impact) results from a highway that bisects or highway network that subdivides a large natural patch.

40|$|In conserving {{regional}} insect diversity dispersal corridors are advocated {{to counteract}} fragmentation and for resilience to climate change. However, influences of corridor design and management on their function are poorly understood. Effects of contrasting matrix structure on the suitability {{and function of}} trackways as corridors for dispersal of an arenicolous carabid beetle, Harpalus rufipalpis (Sturm), was studied within a plantation landscape using mark-release-recapture. A total of 1, 120 marked H. rufipalpis were released into four trackways: two “open” trackways surrounded by pine plantations aged 13 – 16 years and two “shaded” trackways surrounded by plantations aged 26 – 37 years. Dispersal was monitored by a grid of pitfall transects placed across trackways at intervals of four meters, extending 44 m {{north and south of}} the release point. Numbers of resident and marked recaptured H. rufipalpis, their average daily movement rates and numbers of recaptures in the north and south direction were compared between open and shaded trackways using 238 recaptures. The surrounding matrix affected trackway suitability with greater abundance of resident beetles found in open trackways; however H. rufipalpis was also naturally present in shaded trackways. H. rufipalpis were more active in <b>low</b> quality shaded <b>corridors</b> as inferred from the greater number of recaptures and from greater daily movement rates.

40|$|International audienceThe E­W {{trending}} Atlas System of Maghreb {{consists of}} weakly shortened, intra-continental fold belts associated with plateau areas ("Mesetas"), extending between the south-westernmost {{branch of the}} Mediterranean Alpine Belt (Rif-Tell) and the Sahara Platform. Although the Atlas system has been erected contemporaneously from Morocco to Algeria and Tunisia during the Middle Eocene to Recent, it displays a conspicuous longitudinal asymmetry, with i) Paleozoic outcrops restricted to its western part; ii) highest elevation occurring in the west, both in the Atlas System and its foreland (Anti-Atlas); iii) <b>low</b> elevation <b>corridors</b> (e. g. Hodna) and depressed foreland (Tunisian Chotts and Sahel area) in the east. We analyse the origin of these striking contrasts in relation with i) the Variscan heritage; ii) crustal vertical movements during the Mesozoic; iii) crustal shortening during the Cenozoic and finally, iv) the occurrence of a Miocene­Quaternary hot mantle anomaly in the west. The Maghreb lithosphere was affected by the Variscan orogeny, and thus thickened only in its western part. During the Late Permian­Triassic, a paleo-high formed in the west between the Central Atlantic and Alpine Tethys rift systems, giving birth to the emergent/poorly subsident West Moroccan Arch. During the late Middle Jurassic­Early Cretaceous, Morocco and western Algeria were dominantly emergent whereas rifting lasted on in eastern Algeria and Tunisia. We ascribe the uplift of the western regions to thermal doming, consistent with the Late Jurassic and Barremian gabbroic magmatism observed there. After the widespread transgression of the high stand Cenomanian­Turonian seas, the inversion of the Atlas System began during the Senonian {{as a consequence of}} the Africa­Eurasia convergence. Erosion affected three ENE-trending uplifted areas of NW Africa, which we consider as lithospheric anticlines related to the incipient Africa­Europe convergence. In contrast, in eastern Algeria and Tunisia a NW-trending rift system developed contemporaneously (Sirt rifting), normal to the general trend of the Atlas System. The general inversion and orogenesis of the Atlas System occurred during two distinct episodes, Middle­Late Eocene­Oligocene and Late Miocene­Pliocene, respectively, whereas during the intervening period, the Africa­Europe convergence was mainly accommodated in the Rif-Tell system. Inversion tectonics and crustal thickening may account for the moderate uplift of the eastern Atlas System, not for the high elevation of the western mountain ranges (Middle Atlas, High Atlas, Anti-Atlas). In line with previous authors, we ascribe part of the recent uplift of the latter regions to the occurrence of a NE-trending, high-temperature mantle anomaly, here labelled the Moroccan Hot Line (MHL), which is also marked by a strip of late Miocene­Quaternary alkaline magmatism and significant seismicity...|$|R

This dataset highlights a subducted similar to 30 x 40 km, double-peak seamount that belongs to the Atacames seamount chain and that is associated with a deep morphologic re-entrant containing mass transport deposits. The seamount subduction uplifted the margin basement by similar to 1. 6 km and pervasively broke the margin by deep and intense reverse faulting ahead of the seamount, a process that is likely to weaken considerably the margin. In the seamount wake, the basement reverse fault system rotated counter-clockwise. This faulted basement is overlain with slope sediment sliding along listric normal faults that sole out onto the BSR. This superposition of deep tectonic contraction within the basement and shallow gravitational extension deformation within the sediment highlights the key role of gas hydrate on outer slope erosion. In addition to long-term regional basal erosion, the margin basement has thinned locally by an extra 0. 8 - 1 km in response to the subduction of the Atacames seamount chain and hydrofracturing by overpressured fluids at the margin toe. This pervasively and deeply fractured margin segment is associated with a seismically quiet and GPS-modeled <b>low</b> interseismic coupling <b>corridor</b> that terminates downdip near the 1942 epicenter and locked zone. We suggest that the deeply buried double-peak Atacames seamount triggered the 1942 earthquake ahead of its leading flank. This result supports previous studies proposing that subducted seamounts provide unfavorable conditions for locking the updip segment of the plate boundary limiting the updip extent of seismogenic zones, but may favor large subduction earthquakes at greater depths...|$|R

This superposition of deep tectonic contraction within the basement and shallow gravitational extension deformation within the sediment highlights the key role of gas hydrate on outer slope erosion. In addition to long-term regional basal erosion, the margin basement has thinned locally by an extra 0. 8 – 1 km in response to the subduction of the Atacames seamount chain and hydrofracturing by overpressured fluids at the margin toe. This pervasively and deeply fractured margin segment is associated with a seismically quiet and GPS-modeled <b>low</b> interseismic coupling <b>corridor</b> that terminates downdip near the 1942 epicenter and locked zone. We suggest that the deeply buried double-peak Atacames seamount triggered the 1942 earthquake ahead of its leading flank. This result supports previous studies proposing that subducted seamounts provide unfavorable conditions for locking the updip segment of the plate boundary limiting the updip extent of seismogenic zones, but may favor large subduction earthquakes at greater depths...|$|R
40|$|Traditional urban {{public transit}} {{may be on}} the verge of {{disruption}} with the global rise of new mobility services, such as on-demand ride-sharing, car-sharing and MaaS. Tram assets were found to be most vulnerable for disruption as the tram lacks the speed advantage of the metro and de bus has limited dedicated assets. Tram assets could run the risk of depreciation or disutility which can be a problem for the asset owner, tax payers and city residents. Digital On-demand Ride-sharing Services (DORS) are a likely suspect to disrupt the tram, because short term diffusion and substitution with transit is plausible according to literature. DORS providers include ride-sourcing, ride-sharing, ride-splitting, microtransit and combinations of them. All match supply and demand of available vehicles/seats using a digital platform. Scientific literature on potential impact of DORS on tram investments is lacking however. This thesis aimed to contribute to science by exploring the potential impact of DORS developments on investment policy in the tram system in an urban context. A framework for substitution was developed and four distinct scenarios for the impact of DORS on tram substitution and investments were written with the help of an expert panel. Moreover, the implications of these scenarios for tram investment policy were discussed. It was found that the development of DORS can have significant impact on tram investment policy, because substitution to some degree and risk of divestment is probable in three out of four scenarios. Disruptive impact however is probable in only one scenario and impact is larger for the already <b>low</b> demand tram <b>corridors</b> and less to non, for the bigger tram corridors. DORS can be beneficial for tram investments as well. To address this uncertainty in investment policy a robust and multiple strategy approach can be considered. MTA can also gamble by not considering the scenarios or choose one as truth, but this is not without risks...|$|R
40|$|More {{than two-thirds}} of Australia is {{classified}} as arid or semi arid and receives less than 500 mm of rain annually. Throughout these arid areas, rivers and drainage lines (which often have their catchments in higher rainfall areas) act as arteries for vast amounts of water to flow into these dry landscapes. Many inland rivers, including the Paroo, Bulloo and Cooper Creeks, have highly variable flow rates and can go many years with very little or no flow. As {{a result of the}} hydrology of these areas, they contain different soil characteristics and vegetation communities from the surrounding arid landscapes. For example, soil nutrients are thought to be higher along drainage lines and on floodplains due to sediment deposition and decomposition of organic material. Also, vegetation in these areas needs to not only survive drought conditions (as a plant or propogule), but also periodic inundation and flood events. These characteristics are thought to make these areas more productive than the surrounding arid lanscapes and are thought to be important habitats for flora and fauna. There has been much debate over the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrate species. Several studies internationally in mesic areas have suggested that riparian corridors contain higher levels of biodiversity than the surrounding habitats, although this pattern is not replicated in all areas or for all taxonomic groups. Many of these studies suggest that the difference in biodiversity between riparian areas and adjacent habitats should be greater in xeric areas where the habitat differences between these areas are greatest. Other studies have suggested that diversity is not necessarily greater but riparian areas are important habitats for different species and may act as a refuge for some species. In Australia, very few studies have been conducted on the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrates in arid areas, despite these habitats being under threat from grazing, flow alteration and flow diversion. In this study I examined the role of the Field River in the Simpson Desert as a potential refuge for vertebrate species and compared diversity and population dynamics of vertebrates at dune and riverine sites. Specifically this study aimed to: 1) determine if species richness of vertebrates along the Field River was greater in riverine ecosystems than the surrounding dune habitats; 2) quantify how the riverine habitats differed in terms of floristics, vegetation complexity, soils and water availability from the surrounding landscapes; 3) determine the dynamics of terrestrial vertebrate populations along the Field River; and 4) determine if the abundance, diversity and demographics of small vertebrate populations along the Field River was different from populations in the sand dune fields on a broader landscape scale. These questions were examined on Ethabuka Station in the Simpson Desert, Queensland, from 2006 to 2008. The riparian corridor along the Field River was found to have a range of characteristics that make it unique from the surrounding dune habitats. Soils along the riverine corridor were found to be characterised by more than 20 % clay while soils on the dune crest were characterised by no more than 5 % clay. Further, soil carbon and nitrogen was significantly higher in the riverine corridor than in the dune habitats and decreased with distance from the catchment. Spinifex (Triodia basedowii) cover was <b>low</b> in the <b>corridor</b> but dominated the dune swale. Number of trees and cover by trees and non-spinifex grasses were also significantly higher in the riverine corridor when compared to the surrounding dunes. Following the rainfall, annual cover was also significantly greater and they persisted much longer than in the dunes. There was very little difference in the diversity or number of invertebrates between the different habitat types. Species richness was estimated to be highest (48 species) in the riverine centre and lowest in the floodplain (30 species). The riverine habitats had different species pools when compared to the dune habitats. Several species including Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella exclusively inhabited the riverine habitats while others such as the skinks Ctenotus ariadnae and Ctenotus dux were captured only in the dune habitats. Results from a Canonical Correspondence Analysis suggest that the distribution of some species in arid areas, such as the introduced House Mouse (Mus musculus), may be correlated with habitat characteristics associated with the riverine corridor, e. g. soil moisture or high annual cover. Abundance, body condition and reproduction of mammals along the Field River was generally driven by time. On a local scale, habitat had little effect on the abundance of the Sandy Inland Mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) and Lesser Hairy-footed Dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni), although M. musculus showed some preference for the riverine corridor. Abundance and reproduction of both rodent species increased following rainfall while S. youngsoni abundance was strongly seasonal with increases in abundance in autumn and winter. More than 45 % of all captures were reptiles and this group was the most diverse and conspicuous fauna group along the riverine corridor. Abundance of the two most common lizard species, the Military Dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis) and Central-netted Dragons (Ctenophorus nuchalis), was significantly affected by time, with the abundance of both species decreasing dramatically 12 months after rainfall, possibly due to increased predation. Abundance of the Beaked Gecko, Rhynchoedura ornata, began to decrease prior to rainfall, suggesting a factor other than habitat structure or food availability causing the decline. The skink, Lerista labialis, showed strong seasonal trends in abundance and body condition, which suggested that within the desert riverine corridor the species was not reliant on rain-induced changes in food availability. To compare the effect of habitat on species richness, composition and population dynamics at a regional scale, sites along the riparian corridor were compared with dune sites located 500 m to 45 km from the Field River. On this scale, species species richness varied spatially with only one of the riverine sites having higher estimated species richness than the dune sites. Species turnover was greater in riverine sites despite the habitat data suggesting that primary production in these sites was more stable. Some species were able to persist at riverine sites at all times of the year but were only present in the community at dune sites following rainfall, suggesting that the riverine sites may be a more stable habitat for some species. Composition analysis revealed that dune and riverine habitats contain different communities, and some species, particularly Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella, probably rely on the river for their habitat requirements. Population dynamics including abundance, reproduction and body condition of seven species were compared between dune and riverine habitats. Only four, M. musculus, L. labialis, C. nuchalis and S. youngsoni, showed any significant affect of habitat on abundance. Abundance of C. nuchalis, S. youngsoni and L. labialis were generally more abundant in the dune habitats although the affect was only significant for some sampling sessions. The only species that was significantly more abundant in the riverine habitats than dune habitats was the introduced M. musculus. This species appears to be reliant on the riverine corridor, only appearing commonly in the dune habitats following rainfall. For most species, the number of juveniles captured increased following the rainfall in January 2007 but only in C. nuchalis and P. hermannsburgensis was there any significant difference between habitat types. For both species, generally more juveniles were captured in the dune habitats than in the riverine habitats. This study provided information {{on the role of the}} Field River to vertebrate fauna on Ethabuka Station. Although, the study focused only on one ephemeral desert river, it could be considered representative of similar desert rivers such as the Hay, Plenty and Hale rivers further west in central Australia. The riverine corridor did represent a different habitat to the surrounding sand dunes, and some characteristics, such as greater soil moisture, soil nutrients and annual cover, suggest that it may have greater and more stable primary production. Although the species studied did not generally have greater abundance and body condition, or reproduce more in the riverine corridor, many species including the Long-nosed Dragon (Amphibolurus longirostris), Desert Tree Frog (Litoria rubella) and Pygmy Mulga Monitor (Varanus gilleni) are likely to rely on the habitat that the riverine corridor provides. With expanding human populations placing greater pressure on rivers around the world, particularly in arid areas, it is imperative that we understand the ecology of these riparian systems so that effective management and conservation strategies can be developed...|$|R
