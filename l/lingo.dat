25|$|Also, the {{interaction}} between English and other languages is predicted {{to be an important}} area of study.

25|$|A {{portion of}} the {{homeless}} population are generally in transit, {{but there is no}} generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular <b>lingo</b> to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of Roma, Sinti and other ethnic descent have rejected the term gypsy, which they view as a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, vagabond, tramp or drifter. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, e.g. hobo. The pejorative term bum is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic. The term transient is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Attorney General John Doar {{and former}} Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, {{representing}} President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma {{to meet with}} King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march.

Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al <b>Lingo</b> in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a massive}} change in both {{leadership}} and programming {{at the network}} took place. Liberty Media acquired a 50% stake in the network and changed its leadership.

He and incoming vice president Bob Boden began the biggest original programming venture since the network's inception, launching Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck, Friend or Foe?, Russian Roulette, <b>Lingo,</b> WinTuition and Cram.
