5|$|On {{days when}} a <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> is expected, {{hundreds}} of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, {{waiting for the}} waves to arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for {{this part of the}} river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the bore.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of {{recorded}} music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began {{to have a more}} consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> tenors and B basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube is a <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> tube {{with a series}} of internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E

The 5-cylinder DC9 (later DC09) engines featured a <b>larger</b> <b>bore</b> and displace 9.3-litres (9291 cc) instead of 8.9-litres. The new DC13 engines feature both a <b>larger</b> <b>bore</b> and a longer stroke, and therefore displace 12.7-litres (12742 cc) instead of 11.7-litres. Some engines also received slight performance improvements, for example the DC9 engine that outputs 310 hp (1550 Nm) was upgraded to 320 hp (1600 Nm).|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "twin", [...] "double" [...] or [...] "two" [...] hose {{configuration}} of scuba demand valve {{was the first}} in general use. This type of regulator has two <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> corrugated breathing tubes. One tube is to supply air from the regulator to the mouthpiece, and the second tube delivers the exhaled gas to a point where the ambient pressure is identical to the demand diaphragm, where it is released through a rubber duck-bill one-way valve, and comes out of the holes in the cover. Advantages of this type of regulator are that the bubbles leave the regulator behind the diver's head, increasing visibility, reducing noise and producing less load on the diver's mouth, They remain popular with some underwater photographers and Aqualung brought out an updated version of the Mistral in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The second theory {{comes from}} Kay Smith who {{points out that}} key to {{developing}} the classic gun may be a new method of gun casting, muzzle side up. Smith observes: [...] "The surviving pieces of ordnance from earlier in the 15th century are big pieces with <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> sizes. They do not look like the long thin gun.… Essentially they are parallel-sided tubes with flat ends. The explanation is, probably, that they were cast muzzle down in the traditional bell-founding method whereas the long thin guns were cast muzzle up.… Perhaps this marks the real 'revolution' in artillery. Once the technique of casting muzzle up with the attendant advantages, {{and it is not}} clear what those are at present, had been mastered by cannon founders, the way was open for the development of the 'classic' form of artillery." [...] However, Smith himself states that {{it is not clear what}} advantages this technique would have conferred, despite its widespread adoption.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{manufacturing}} focused on standard grades of black powder from Fg used in <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> rifles and shotguns, through FFg (medium and small-bore arms such as muskets and fusils), FFFg (small-bore rifles and pistols), and FFFFg (extreme small bore, short pistols and most commonly for priming flintlocks). [...] A coarser grade {{for use in}} military artillery blanks was designated A-1. These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. [...] In the United Kingdom, the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter {{of one or two}} millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters. [...] Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS sieve mesh size, being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains. Recognized grain sizes are Gunpowder G 7, G 20, G 40, and G 90.|$|E

5|$|The <b>largest</b> <b>bores</b> occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days.

Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also [...] "created internal strains and structural irregularities," [...] and these problems were even more prevalent in <b>large</b> <b>bore</b> castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior." [...] Doing this forced the thickest material {{toward the center of the}} barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention.|$|E

60|$|At Mataram {{we called}} {{at the house}} of Gusti Gadioca, one of the princes of Lombock, who was a friend of Mr. Carter's, and who had promised to show me the guns made by native workmen. Two guns were exhibited, one six, the other seven feet long, and of a proportionably <b>large</b> <b>bore.</b> The barrels were twisted and well finished, though not so finely worked as ours. The stock was well made, and {{extended}} {{to the end of the}} barrel. Silver and gold ornament was inlaid over most of the surface, but the locks were taken from English muskets. The Gusti assured me, however, that the Rajah had a man who made locks and also rifled barrels. The workshop where these guns are made and the tools used were next shown us, and were very remarkable. An open shed with a couple of small mud forges were the chief objects visible. The bellows consisted of two bamboo cylinders, with pistons worked by hand. They move very easily, having a loose stuffing of feathers thickly set round the piston so as to act as a valve, and produce a regular blast. Both cylinders communicate with the same nozzle, one piston rising while the other falls. An oblong piece of iron on the ground was the anvil, and a small vice was fixed on the projecting root of a tree outside. These, with a few files and hammers, were literally the only tools with which an old man makes these fine guns, finishing then himself from the rough iron and wood.|$|E
