5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson (1980) {{held that}} even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows {{drunkenness}} to negate basic intent; and Lloyd v. DPP (1992) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having parked on another's property knowing {{of the risk of}} being clamped, does not have a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> under the Act even if he makes a mistake of law.|$|E

25|$|On the {{recommendation}} of an advisory committee, the Minister may direct that a detainee be released {{from day to day}} to engage in employment, including self-employment. A detainee may also be granted leave subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister thinks fit. Any detainee who has been permitted to engage in employment or is granted leave who remains at large without <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> or fails to return to his place of detention after the direction or leave has been revoked is deemed to be unlawfully at large and to have escaped from lawful custody.|$|E

500|$|The {{courts have}} said that a {{defendant}} relying upon <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> as a defence need not necessarily seek to put himself within section 5. In R v. Denton (1981), the defendant had been asked by his employer to {{set fire to the}} employer's factory to facilitate an insurance claim. Despite this, it was held that the owner of the factory was entitled to have it burned down – as the Lord Chief Justice put it, [...] "t is not an offence for a man to set light to his own ... property" [...] – and therefore Denton, knowing this, had a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> independent of section 5.|$|E

Observe, sir, that the bull does still bind the {{so-called}} queen, and that she and her magistrates are still none the less usurpers, nonentities, and shadows of a shade. And observe this, sir, that when that which is <b>lawful</b> is <b>excused</b> to the weak, it remains no less lawful to the strong. The seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to Baal did not slay his priests; but Elijah did, and won to himself a good reward. And if the rest of the children of Israel sinned not in not slaying Eglon, yet Ehud's deed was none the less justified by all laws human and divine." ...|$|R
50|$|All banknotes, {{regardless}} {{of when they}} were withdrawn from circulation, may be presented at the Bank of England {{where they will be}} exchanged for current banknotes and coins. In practice, commercial banks will accept most banknotes from their customers and negotiate them with the Bank of England themselves. However, forgeries (including Bernhard notes) will be retained and destroyed by the Bank. If a suspect note is found to be genuine a full refund by cheque will be made. However, it is a criminal offence to knowingly hold or pass a counterfeit bank note without <b>lawful</b> authority or <b>excuse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Defamatory libel" [...] is a {{criminal}} offence under the Criminal Code. Subsection 298(1) defines defamatory libel as a [...] "matter published, without <b>lawful</b> justification or <b>excuse,</b> {{that is likely to}} injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person of or concerning whom it is published." [...] Section 300 prohibits the publication of defamatory libels that the publisher [...] "knows is false." [...] Section 301 prohibits the publication of any defamatory libel, but this section has been found unconstitutional because it could criminalize the publication of matters that are true.|$|R
500|$|It is {{an offence}} to carry, or have in one's {{possession}} or under one's control in a security area without <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse,</b> any firearm, ammunition or explosive without lawful authority. The penalty for the offence is death. The onus {{is on the}} person charged {{to prove that he}} or she has a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> for having the item, and this can only be done by demonstrating that he or she acquired the item in a lawful manner for a lawful purpose, and did not act [...] "in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order" [...] while in possession of or having control of it. Furthermore, the person charged has lawful authority to have the item only if he or she: ...|$|E
500|$|However, in R v. Hill and Hall (1989), the Court of Appeal {{introduced}} an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants {{had been convicted}} of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would {{at some point in the}} future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Given that Hill was [...] "forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow", the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however honest the belief had been.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{the police}} {{launched}} Operation Maida, and again searched the moor {{for the body}} of Keith Bennett. They read statements from Brady and Hindley, and also studied photographs taken by the pair. Their search was aided {{by the use of}} sophisticated modern equipment, including a US satellite used to look for evidence of soil movement. The BBC reported on 1 July 2009 that Greater Manchester Police had officially given up the search for Keith Bennett, saying that [...] "only a major scientific breakthrough or fresh evidence would see the hunt for his body restart". Detectives were also reported as saying that they would never again give Brady the attention or the thrill of leading another fruitless search on the moor where they believe Keith Bennett's remains are buried. Donations from members of the public funded a search of the moor for Bennett's body by volunteers from a Welsh search and rescue team that began in March 2010. In August 2012, it was claimed that Brady may have given details of the location of Keith Bennett's body to one of his visitors. A woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse,</b> but a few months later the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was insufficient evidence to press charges. Keith Bennett's body remains undiscovered as of , although his family continues to search the moor.|$|E
50|$|In British {{possessions}} abroad, {{interference with}} religious worship was usually {{dealt with by}} legislation, {{and not as a}} common-law offence. In India it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the Queensland Criminal Code of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without <b>lawful</b> justification or <b>excuse</b> (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled.|$|R

It is protected under the Security of Information Act, Section 5(2)(e) stating: [...] "Every person who, without <b>lawful</b> authority or <b>excuse,</b> manufactures or sells, or has in his possession for sale, any die, seal or stamp referred to in subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years or by summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 12 months or to a fine of not more than $2,000." ...|$|R
50|$|False {{monetary}} instruments (section 46A). Section 46A {{was inserted}} by the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003. It provides {{that it is}} an offence for a person to counterfeit or falsify a specified monetary instrument with the intention that it be uttered as genuine, and for a person to have in his custody or control, without <b>lawful</b> authority or <b>excuse,</b> a counterfeit or falsified monetary instrument or devices or materials designed or adapted for making such instruments. The penalties for these offences are up to 10 years imprisonment. The section applies to instruments specified in the False Monetary Instruments (Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/321), i.e. money orders, postal orders, United Kingdom postage stamps, share certificates, cheques and other bills of exchange, travellers' cheques, bankers' drafts, promissory notes, cheque cards, debit cards, and credit cards.|$|R

2500|$|The demonstrators {{were charged}} with {{obstruction}} of public place. The Court of Final Appeal, constituted by the same judges in Leung Kwok-hung and Others v. HKSAR, allowed the appeal from the defendants and quashed all convictions. The court stressed that any physical obstruction of a public place {{must be accompanied by}} the element of [...] "without a lawful excuse" [...] in order to constitute an offence. If a person is merely using public place reasonably, they cannot be said to be acting without <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse.</b> When obstruction results from a peaceful demonstration, the constitutionally protected right is introduced into the equation for reasonableness. The court concluded the demonstrators were acting with reasonable excuse and acquitted them with regard to the offense of obstruction of public place.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, Lucas {{expressed}} {{her support}} for seven campaigners of the Smash EDO campaign who had caused approximately £180,000 damage to an EDO MBM arms factory and were acquitted of conspiring to cause criminal damage. The jury accepted their defence of <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> – action undertaken {{to prevent a}} much worse crime – because the company manufactured and sold certain components used by the Israeli military, notably in its assault on Gaza. Lucas stated that: [...] "I am absolutely delighted the jury has recognised that {{the actions of the}} decommissioners were a legitimate response to the atrocities being committed in Gaza. I do not advocate non-violent direct action lightly ... their actions were driven by the responsibility to prevent further suffering in Gaza." ...|$|E

2500|$|If a [...] "specific intent" [...] {{in either}} sense is {{required}} {{and there is}} clear evidence that the accused was too intoxicated to form the element subjectively, this fact is recognised as a defense unless the loss of control {{was part of the}} plan. But this is of little value to defendants since there are almost always offenses of basic intent that can be charged and/or the basic intent offenses are usually lesser included offenses and an alternative verdict can be delivered by judge or jury without the need for a separate charge. In English law, note the controversial Jaggard v Dickinson [...] 3 All ER 716 which held that, {{for the purposes of the}} statutory defense of <b>lawful</b> <b>excuse</b> under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971, a drunken belief will found the defense even though this allows drunkenness to negate basic intent.
