In Trial 1, 30 male Swiss-Webster mice, 8 wk old, were used to measure the in vitro effects of each of the ionophores at concentrations of 1. 62 or 16. 2 mM. Six combinations of three ionophores at two concentrations resulted in a total of eight treatments. All eight treatments were exposed to jejunal. rings from a single mouse for a total of 30 observations per treatment. Jejunal rings were exposed to each ionophore treatment for 15 min. <b>Laidlomycin</b> propionate (16. 2 ni-M) decreased (P < 0. 02) glucose absorption, as estimated by H- 3 - 3 -O-methyl glucose uptake compared with all other treatments, whereas <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate (1. 62 mM) increased (P = 0. 032) jejunal DM content compared with 16. 2 mM <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate. In Trial 2, 40 5 -wk-old mice were allotted into four treatments-control and 16. 2 mM each of monensin, <b>laidlomycin,</b> and <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate-for a total of 10 observations per treatment. lonophores were administered via the drinking water for 14 d. No ionophore treatment had any effect on whole-mouse 02 consumption. Monensin increased (P = 0. 004) stomach size and decreased (P = 0. 049) the efficiency of BW gain compared with controls. <b>Laidlomycin</b> propionate decreased (P = 0. 032) the percentage of whole jejunum oxygen consumption due to oubain-sensitive respiration compared with control. The efficiency of intestinal glucose absorption was not changed due to treatment in either trial. Under the conditions of these studies, monensin, <b>laidlomycin,</b> and <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate had minimal and inconsistent effects on 3 jejunal function and energy utilization in mice. This investigation suggests that changes in the energetic requirements of animals treated with ionophores are not an issue in animal production...|$|E

Meta-analysis of {{the effects}} of <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate, fed alone or in {{combination}} with chlortetracycline, compared with monensin sodium, fed alone or in combination with tylosin, on growth performance, health, and carcass outcomes in finishing steers in North America. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (4), 1662 - 1676. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2015 - 0086 The objective of this research was to use data from multiple studies to comprehensively quantify the effects of feeding 1) <b>laidlomycin</b> propionate (LP), alone and/or in combination with chlortetracycline, compared with 2) monensin sodium (MS), alone and/or in combination with tylosin, at commercially approved dosages, on ADG, DMI, feed efficiency (FE), mortality, and carcass characteristics (HCW and liver abscesses). A secondary objective was to explore potential sources of heterogeneity among the comparative effectiveness studies. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and industry reports was used to identify studies that included direct comparisons of these treatments in finishing steers in North America. Random-effects meta-analysis models of performance, carcass, and health-related outcomes were fitted with extracted data, consisting of a total of 17 data sets comprising a total of 135 pens and 13, 603 steers. Results showed that pens of steers fed LP had increased ADG (live and carcass adjusted), DMI, and HCW compared with those fed monensin (P 0. 05) were identified for FE or for health-related outcomes (overall and cause-specific mortality). There was a substantial amount of heterogeneity in outcomes among studies, and when pen size and type of production setting were included in mixed-effects metaregression models, they accounted for only a small proportion of the between-study heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis models. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting summary estimates in the presence of substantial heterogeneity. However, these results provide comprehensive information on the comparative effects of different ionophores across multiple studies and multiple years, states, and production settings. These unique results can enable quantitative and informed decisions by potential end users of these feed additives that are widely used in the U. S. beef industry for reducing the costs of beef production through enhanced cattle performance...|$|E
