A retrospective {{study was designed to}} test this hypothesis. Methods: In National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B- 11, patients with axil-lary lymph node-positive, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> plus 5 -fluorouracil (PF) or a combi-nation of <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard,</b> 5 -fluorouracil, and doxo-rubicin (PAF). Tumor cell expression of erbB- 2 was determined by immunohistochemistry for 638 of 682 eligible patients. Statistical analyses were performed to test for in-teraction between treatment and erbB- 2 status (positive ver-sus negative) with respect to disease-free survival (DFS), sur-vival, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and distant disease-free survival (DDFS). Reported P values are two-sided. Results: Overexpression of erbB- 2 (i. e., positive immunohis-tochemical staining) was observed in 239 (37. 5 %) of the 638 tumors studied. Overexpression was associated with tumor size (P =. 02), lack of estrogen receptors (P =. 008), and the number of positive lymph nodes (P =. 0001). After a mean time on study of 13. 5 years, the clinical benefit from doxo-rubicin (PAF versus PF) was statistically significant for pa-tients with erbB- 2 -positive tumors—DFS: relative risk of failure (RR) = 0. 60 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 44...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{effect of}} 11 anticancer {{drugs on the}} ability of Raji {{lymphoma}} cells to form colonies in soft agar was determined with the use of both a 1 -hour and a continuous drug exposure. Three distinct patterns of drug sensitivities were observed: a) Dactinomycin, adriamycin, bleomycin, mitomycin C, vincristine, and cis-platinum II all produced a dose-dependent reduction in colony formation following a 1 -hour exposure, which was further augmented by a continuous exposure to the drugs; b) the antimetabolites (methotrexate, p-cytosine arabinoside, and 5 -flu-orouracil) and pentamethylmelamine had no suppressive effects on colony formation with a 1 -hour exposure, but they produced marked cytotoxicity with continuous drug exposure; and c) <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> had the same degree of colony suppres-sion with both a 1 -hour and a continuous drug exposure.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between DNA cross-linking and cell killing by c;'s-diamminedichloroplatinum(ll) (c/s-DDP) and <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (L-PAM) was studied in L 1210 cell culture lines and in mice bearing sensitive and resistant lines of L 1210 leukemia. A line of L 1210 mouse leukemia cells was developed which is resistant to c/s-DDP in vitro. These cells, designated ZCR 9, are cross-resistant to L-PAM. The effect of both {{drugs on the}} ZCR 9 cells, compared to the parent L 1210 K 25 cells, was examined by DNA alkaline elution with and {{without the use of}} proteinase. The resistant line was similar to the normal line with regard to the kinetics of DNA cross-link formation and removal following treatment with c/s-DDP or L-PAM.

40|$|Previously, mouse NIH 3 T 3 {{cells were}} stably {{transfected}} with human DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) cDNA in the antisense orientation {{and under the}} control of a metallothionein promoter [Zmudzka, B. Z. and Wilson, S. H. (1990) Som. Cell Mol. Gen., 16, 311 - 320]. To assess the feasibility of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy by an antisense approach and to confirm a role for beta-pol in cellular DNA repair, we looked for increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents under conditions where beta-pol is down-regulated in the antisense cell line. Such a sensitization is anticipated only where beta-pol is rate-limiting in a DNA repair pathway. A number of agents were tested: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin); 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 - nitrosourea (BCNU); ionizing radiation and the radio-mimetic drug bleomycin; the bifunctional alkylating agents nitrogen mustard and <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (melphalan); the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the cases of cisplatin and UV radiation, a significant enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed. Damage as a result of both of these agents is thought to be repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. The results suggest that, in this cell line, beta-pol is involved in and is rate-limiting in NER. We propose that down-regulation of beta-pol by antisense approaches might be used to enhance the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and other DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen mustards {{alkylate}} DNA {{primarily at}} the N 7 position of guanine. Using an approach analogous {{to that of}} the Maxam-Gilbert procedure for DNA sequence analysis, we have examined the relative frequencies of alkylation for a number of nitrogen mustards at different guanine-N 7 sites on a DNA fragment of known sequence. Most nitrogen mustards were found to have similar patterns of alkylation, with the sites of greatest alkylation being runs of contiguous guanines, and relatively weak alkylation at isolated guanines. Uracil mustard and quinacrine mustard, however, were found to have uniquely enhanced reaction with at least some 5 '-PyGCC- 3 ' and 5 '-GT- 3 ' sequences, respectively. In addition, quinacrine mustard showed a greater reaction at runs of contiguous guanines than did other nitrogen mustards, whereas uracil mustard showed little preference for these sequences. A comparison of the sequence-dependent variations of molecular electrostatic potential at the N 7 -position of guanine with the sequence dependent variations of alkylation intensity for mechlorethamine and <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> showed a good correlation in some regions of the DNA, but not others. It is concluded that electrostatic interactions may contribute strongly to the reaction rates of cationic compounds such as the reactive aziridinium species of nitrogen mustards, but that other sequence selectivities can be introduced in different nitrogen mustard derivatives...|$|E
40|$|One hundred twenty-two {{clinically}} Stage I {{malignant melanoma}} patients were treated prospectively in a nonrandomized trial by hyperthermic isolation perfusion with <b>l-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (l-Pam), regional lymphadenectomy (RL), and wide local excision (WLE) between April 1965 and July 1980. There were 31 males and 91 females. All primary lesions were retrospectively microstaged by Clark's levels and Breslow's thickness criteria {{by one of}} the senior authors. Morphologically, 71 % were superficial spreading melanomas (SSM), 16. 5 % were nodular melanomas (NM), and 11. 9 % were acral lentiginous melanomas. Survival by microstaging and morphology are reported in Table 1. Eighty-one per cent of all patients were disease-free at five years. Twenty-three patients (18. 8 %) recurred and of these, 15 died of their disease. This included six of the seven patients with histologically positive lymph nodes. Complications were not only acceptable but preventable and will be discussed. Microstaging provides a valid basis by which to compare treatment regimens and, more importantly, a valid criteria by which to select treatment for a given patient. These data compare favorably with other reported series. At the time these studies were initiated, five-year survivals for clinically Stage I and II melanoma were roughly 55 % and 15 %, respectively. Existing data clearly indicate that hyperthermic isolation perfusion with RL is superior to WLE and warrants further study in selected patients...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{attempted}} to induce hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in 64 dogs. Preparative treatments included combinations of total-body irradiation (TBI) or localized hepatic irradiation (LI) or both and chemotherapy consisting of dimethylbusulfan (DMB), <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (L-PAM), methotrexate, or monocrotaline. VOD occurred infrequently in those dogs given 9. 2 Gy TBI and DMB (1 / 10), TBI and/or LI (9. 2 - 27 Gy) with L-PAM (2 / 36) or high dose methotrexate and LI (0 / 2). Specifically, VOD {{occurred in the}} dogs with a shorter interval between TBI and DMB or in the dog that received the glutathione reductase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximide (BSO) before L-PAM. In contrast, among 17 dogs given monocrotaline, 8 developed VOD, particularly when used with L-PAM +/- irradiation (7 / 13). The major cause of death, early gastrointestinal toxicity, was further augmented by higher doses of irradiation, by shortening the interval between LI and L-PAM administration to less than 4 weeks, and administering BSO or monocrotaline before L-PAM. Gastrointestinal toxicity was lessened by giving low dose cyclophosphamide given before L-PAM. VOD can be produced in dogs especially with monocrotaline or BSO given before and L-PAM +/- irradiation. However, gastrointestinal toxicity renders the study of VOD beyond the acute phase difficult. Nevertheless, this approach appears useful {{for the study of}} VOD in other animals and for developing agents aimed at preventing VOD...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that norepinephrine (NE) inhibits the in vitro generation of anti-MOPC- 315 CTL activity by spleen cells from BALB/c mice rejecting a large MOPC- 315 tumor {{as a consequence}} of low-dose melphalan (<b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (L-PAM)) treatment (L-PAM TuB spleen cells). Since TNF- � {{plays a key role in}} the generation of antitumor CTL activity in this system, we determined whether NE mediates this inhibition through inhibition of TNF- � production. Here, we show that NE inhibits the production of TNF- � protein and mRNA by L-PAM TuB spleen cells stimulated in vitro with mitomycin C-treated tumor cells. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular expression of TNF- � revealed substantial NE-mediated decreases in the percentages of TNF- � � cells among CD 4 � and CD 8 � T cells and F 4 / 80 � activated macrophages. NE inhibition of CTL generation was largely overcome by addition of TNF- � to the stimulation cultures. When the �-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was added to the stimulation cultures of L-PAM TuB spleen cells at a concentration that prevented NE-induced cAMP elevation, the NEmediated decrease in TNF- � mRNA and NE-mediated inhibition of CTL generation were reversed. Collectively, these results suggest that NE inhibits antitumor CTL generation, at least in part, by inhibiting TNF- � synthesis through a mechanism(s) involving �-adrenergic receptor signaling.

40|$|Summary. -Adriamycin and {{cyclophosphamide}} {{are active}} agents in human and experimental tumours. Using the L 1210 murine leukaemia, their effectiveness alone and in combination was studied. The combination is highly synergistic in this tumour, {{resulting in a}} greater than 5000 survival rate when the agents used alone at optimal doses are not curative. DNA synthesis by tumour cells is substantially inhibited and the total ascitic population much reduced. In contrast, DNA synthesis in sensitive host tissues is less disturbed. There is no major difference in the pharmacology of the agents whether given alone or in combination. In very advanced disease the combination is no better than treatment with cyclophosphamide alone. The combination of adriamycin and melphalan in L 1210 leukaemia also produces superior results to those obtained using either drug alone at its optimal dosage. CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (CTX), an alky-lating agent with activity against a wide range ofexperimental and human tumours, has pronounced effects against the L 1210 transplantable leukaemia, even in rela-tively advanced disease (Lane, 1959). <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (Melphalan, L-PAM) is also active in L 1210, although this agent has been less thoroughly studied than CTX (Goldin and Carter 1973). More recently, the anthracyclene drugs {{have been shown to}} have definite but limited activity against this tumour (Hoshino et al., 1972). Of the anthracyc-lenes, adriamycin (ADR) is clearly superior to daunorubicin in L 1210 and most other experimental tumours (Sandberg et al., 1970; Di Marco and Lenaz, 1973) and in most human malignancies (Bonadonna et al., 1970). Recent reports {{on the use of the}} com-bination of CTX and ADR have been encouraging, both in human studies (Salmon and Jones, 1974; Muggia et al. ...|$|E
40|$|Hyperthermic {{isolated}} limb perfusion (HILP) with <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (L-PAM) {{represents an}} effective treatment for locally advanced melanoma of the limbs. However. regional chemotherapy of melanoma {{still needs to}} be improved. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a methylating agent that spontaneously decomposes into the active metabolite of dacarbazine. the most effective agent for the systemic treatment of melanoma. Tumor cells with high levels of O- 6 -methylouanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and/or with a defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are resistant to TMZ. Inhibition of MGMT activity increases TMZ sensitivity of MMR-proficient, but not of MMR-deficient cells, while inhibition of base excision repair (BER) potentiates TMZ cytotoxicity in both cell types. Recent studies, performed in an animal model, have shown that TMZ is more effective than L-PAM when applied regionally and that hyperthermia can increase the antitumor activity of TMZ. In this study, three thermoresistant human melanoma cell lines, endowed with different MGMT activity and functional status of the MMR system. were treated with TMZ at 37 degrees C or 41. 5 degrees C for 90 min, and then analyzed for cell growth and MGMT activity. Hyperthermia significantly enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity in MMR-proficient cells, either endowed or not with MGMT activity, and in MMR-deficient cells. Endogenous MGMT activity was not affected by hyperthermia that, however, enhanced the enzyme depletion induced by TMZ treatment. Moreover, MGMT recovery after drug removal was delayed in cells that had been treated at 41. 5 degrees C. Taken together, these findings confirm the therapeutic potential of a combined treatment of hyperthermia and TMZ. They also suggest that inhibition of BER and/or increased DNA methylation may be involved in the thermal enhancement of TMZ cytotoxicity. Additional studies are necessary to better clarify the mechanisms underlying hyperthermia-induced potentiation of TMZ activity. However, the present investigation provides further support to the development of clinical trials of HILP with TMZ...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of {{ornithine}} decarboxylase (ODC), such as alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), {{may influence the}} cytotoxicity of anti-tumour agents that interact with DNA. Intracellular levels of putrescine and spermidine were markedly reduced by ODC inhibitors while the level of spermine, which is the main polyamine in nuclei, was unchanged. By combining a novel inhibitor of ODC, such as (2 R, 5 R) - 6 -heptyne- 2, 5 -diamine (MDL 72. 175, MAP), with an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), such as 5 '-[[(Z) - 4 -aminobut- 2 -enyl]methylamino]- 5 '-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73. 811, AbeAdo), spermine was selectively depleted in a human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR- 3 (i. e. spermine became almost undetectable whereas the levels of spermidine and putrescine were not affected). The depletion of spermine blocked DNA synthesis with a consequent accumulation of cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Pretreatment with MAP plus AbeAdo did not change the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents, such as <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> (L-PAM), 1, 4 -bis(2 '-chloroethyl) - 1, 4 -diazabicyclo-[2. 2. 1] heptane diperchlorate (DABIS), 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP), N-deformyl-N-[4 -N-N,N-bis (2 -chloroethylamino) benzoyl] (tallimustine) or CC- 1065, whereas it markedly reduced the cytotoxicity of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as doxorubicin (DX) and 4 '-demethylepipodophyllotoxin- 5 -(4, 6 -O) -ethylidene- beta-D-glycopyranoside (VP- 16). The addition of spermine before drug treatment restored the sensitivity to the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, thus indicating that the reduced effect {{was related to the}} intracellular spermine level. The reason for the reduction in cytotoxicity is unclear, but it {{does not appear to be}} related to a cell cycle effect or to a decrease in the intracellular level of DNA topoisomerase II. Drugs that modify polyamine biosynthesis are under early clinical development as potential new anti-tumour agents. These findings illustrate the need for caution in combining such drugs with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{antiserum}} elicited against calf thymus DNA {{modified to}} 4. 4 % (Pt drug/nucleotide ratio = 0. 044) with the antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) contains antibodies specific for the Pt-modified DNA immunogen {{as well as}} for Pt-DNA adducts formed in both cultured mouse leukemia L 1210 cells and in L 1210 cells from the ascites fluid of tumor-bearing mice exposed to cis-DDP. Pt-modified DNA was electrostatically complexed to methylated bovine serum albumin and injected into rabbits. Early bleedings of the derived antiserum were used to establish a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which demonstrated specificity for the Pt-modified DNA but not for DNA or the Pt drug alone. In the ELISA, 50 % inhibition occurred at a concentration of 0. 5 nM Pt (on DNA) as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This value corresponds to a lower limit of detectability of one adduct in 10 (7) nucleotides, with 50 micrograms of sample DNA added per microtiter well. DNA isolated from cultured mouse L 1210 cells exposed to increasing doses of the Pt drug was found by ELISA to contain from 0. 2 to 10. 0 fmol of Pt adduct per microgram of DNA. These levels remained stable for up to 4 hr after a 1 -hr drug treatment, during which time DNA interstrand crosslinks developed. Thus, the antiserum appears not to be specific for DNA interstrand crosslinks. DNAs from L 1210 cells exposed to trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard</b> were not recognized in the ELISA. DNA prepared from the ascites cells of mice bearing the L 1210 tumor 5 hr after injection of cis-DDP was found to contain about 2 fmol of Pt per microgram of DNA. This work establishes that cis-DDP-DNA adducts prepared in vitro are relevant to the in vivo binding of the Pt drug to its biological target, DNA, and opens new avenues for studying the mechanism of action of the Pt anticancer drugs...|$|E

These cell lines showed a similar stable low level of resistance (approximately 3 -fold) to CDDP and cross-resistance to carboplatin, iproplatin and the new alkylating agent tallimustine, but not to L-PAM (<b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard)</b> and BCNU (1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea). Collateral sensitivity to two inhibitors of topoisomerase II, VP 16 (etoposide) and doxorubicin (Dox), but cross-resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, were observed. The two cell lines were also sensitive to 5 -fluorouracil. No {{increase in the level}} of glutathione or activity of glutathione S-transferase could be observed in resistant cells compared with the parental M 5 cells. Total DNA platination immediately after treatment was similar in the parental and resistant cell lines. Repair of total DNA platination, measured after 24 h of recovery, was undetectable in M 5 and MS/CDDP cells, but was 33 % in M 5 /CDDPc cells. Initial DNA-interstrand cross-links (DNA-ISC) were six times higher in M 5 than in M 5 /CDDP cells, but 24 h after treatment, both lines had completely repaired this damage. M 5 /CDDPc cells did not show formation of DNA-ISC at any time after treatment. The two resistant cell lines were tumorigenic when implanted in mice and resistant to CDDP treatment in vivo. The CDDP resistant tumours were not cross-resistant in vivo to L-PAM, BCNU and Dox, which had been active in vitro, nor to tallimustine, which had been cross-resistant in vitro. Mechanisms of resistance in M 5 /CDDP and M 5 -CDDPc seem to be based on a lower formation of DNA-ISC combined, for the latter cell line, with a higher repair capacity for total DNA platination.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate in a multicenter setting the feasibility and efficacy of a high-dose sequential (HDS) chemotherapy regimen that combined intensive debulking and high-dose therapy (HDT) with peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) autografting in patients with refractory or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). METHODS. Data were collected from 102 patients with HL who were treated with the HDS regimen at 14 centers associated with the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi. Twenty-four patients had primary refractory HL, 59 patients had their first recurrence of HL (within I year in 32 patients and > 1 year in 27 patients), and 19 patients had multiple disease recurrences. The HDS regimen included the sequential delivery of high-dose (hd) cyclophosphamide with PBPC harvesting, methotrexate, etoposide, then HDT (usually hd mitoxantrone plus <b>L-phenylalanine</b> <b>mustard)</b> with PBPC autografting. In addition, radiotherapy was delivered to 36 patients at sites of bulky or persistent disease. RESULTS. Ninety-two patients (90 %) completed the HDS program. There were five toxic deaths (treatment-related mortality rate, 4. 9 %) and six secondary malignancies (five patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia, and one patient developed colorectal carcinoma). At a median follow-up of 5 years, the 5 -year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) projections were 64 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % Cl], 54 - 74 %) and 53 % (95 % Cl, 43 - 63 %), respectively. Patients with their first recurrence had the most favorable outcome, with 5 -year OS and EFS projections of 77 % (95 % CI, 66 - 88 %) and 63 % (95 % CI, 50 - 76 %), respectively. There {{were no significant differences between}} patients with early first recurrence and late first recurrence. The poorest outcome was observed in patients with refractory HL, with 5 -year OS and EFS projections of 36 % (95 % Cl, 16 - 55 %) and 33 % (95 % Cl, 14 - 52 %), respectively. Patients who received HDS chemotherapy after multiple recurrences had an intermediate outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that refractory disease and systemic symptoms at the time of initial presentation were associated significantly associated with poor OS and EFS. CONCLUSIONS. The use of HDS chemotherapy for patients with refractory and/or recurrent HL is feasible at the multicenter level. The combination of intensive debulking and HDT with PBPC autografting offers a good chance of prolonged disease free survival for patients with their first recurrence of HL...|$|E
