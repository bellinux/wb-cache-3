40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} sixty years, {{cylindrical}} steel cannons (<b>long</b> <b>mortar</b> and short mortar) {{have been used in}} France to assess the safety of explosives with regard to firedamp. These testing methods are considered expensive mainly because a large number of shots are needed äs a result of the low level of reproducibility. Also, using them with certain explosives, such äs slurries and emulsions, is somewhat problematical. Taking into aecount the Polish expertise, CERCHAR (now INERIS) developed m the sixties a testing method in which the Charge, placed in a steel groove mortar, is isolated from the methane-air mixture by an asbestos-cement plate. This method seems more attractive than those traditionally used, {{especially when it comes to}} distinguishing rock explosives from the more powerfui pennitted explosives...|$|E
40|$|Research {{to develop}} tests that can {{accurately}} predict {{the effects of}} deicing chemicals on the corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is reported. The research includes the development and evaluation of a standard test specimen {{and the use of}} three deicing chemicals to determine the sensitivity of both corrosion potential and macrocell corrosion to molal ion con-centrations ranging from 0. 4 to 6. 4. The standard test specimen consists of a No. 4 reinforcing bar embedded in a 1. 18 in. (30 mm) diameter, 4 in. (100 mm) <b>long</b> <b>mortar</b> cylinder. The mortar is made using portland cement, deionized water, and standard graded Ottawa sand. Specimens cured in lime-saturated water reach a passive condition within 14 days. The tests are easy to perform, require no special training, and can normally be completed within 60 days. Of the two tests, the corrosion potential test provides more consistent results and should prove to be a useful tool for comparing the effects of deicing chemicals on the corrosion of reinforcing steel. Additional modifications are needed in the macrocell test before it is ready for general use. Based on limited test data using sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and calcium magnesium acetate, calcium chloride appears to be the most detrimental, followed in order by sodium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate. Corrosion in the presence of calcium magnesium acetate appears to be highly sensitive to relative concentration, with no corrosion occurring at a molal ion concentra-tion of 0. 4. In contrast, specimens exposed to both calcium chloride and sodium chloride exhibit measurable corrosion potential at a concentration of 0. 4 m. At the highest concentration for which comparisons were made (6. 4 m), both the CMA and the CaC 12 appear to be equally detrimental, while the NaCl appears to cause somewhat less corrosion. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} an {{original}} {{contribution to the}} understanding of the hydraulic behaviour of cement-based materials when subjected to temperature rises. Permeability is measured continuously during heating by injecting inert gas into a sample at homogeneous temperature. Using a confining cell especially designed in our laboratory, the sample is submitted to a constant heating rate, up to 200 °C, superimposed to hydrostatic pressure (at ca. 5 MPa). In parallel with a normalised CEM II mortar (water-to-cement ratio (W/C) of 0. 5), a CEM V-cement-based concrete, used in nuclear waste storage applications, is studied. For normalised mortar, gas retention is evidenced, depending on the sample size (scale effect), water saturation level Sw, and heating rate. For dry normalised mortar, permeability may be divided by two during heating. In conjunction with thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA) results, such evolution is attributed to the dehydration of C–S–H around 150 °C. Indeed, mass loss after heat cycling is substantially higher than that due to free water release solely: mortar loses structural, bound water during the process. For partially-saturated and <b>long</b> <b>mortar</b> samples, a gas retention phenomenon is recorded when heating at a rate of ca. 4. 9 °C/min. Our analysis is that free water inside the macropores, as well as bound water released from the C–S–H, dilates or vaporizes, and obstructs the interconnected porous network. Due to moisture clogging, no more gas is allowed through the material pore network: a so-called gas retention phenomenon occurs. Most interestingly, although loosing structural water like normalised mortar, yet over a wider temperature range, dry CEM V concrete displays good temperature resistance, as its permeability remains constant during heating. For highly partially-saturated concrete, a gas retention effect is recorded. As a conclusion, observed phenomena at the laboratory scale testify of potentially strong gas retention effects upon engineering structures subjected to temperature gradients over time. Indeed, quite low temperature rises (and heating rates) are able to induce moisture clogging inside partially-saturated materials. It is also concluded that cement-based material composition, i. e. bound water release ability, is influential in gas transport phenomena under temperature...|$|E

50|$|Razm is an Iranian 120 mm {{long-range}} mortar {{unveiled in}} 2010 and produced by DIO. This {{is one of}} the world's <b>longest</b> range <b>mortars</b> achieving a range of 16 km with rocket-assisted munitions and can be used alongside tube artillery. To achieve this range, Razm uses an unusually long barrel. The overall design of the mortar {{is similar to that of}} 120 mm HM 16. Due to its long barrel, the weight of the system is too high to be carried by infantry. Thus it is mounted on Kaviran tactical vehicle, Boragh or other vehicles. While mounted on Kaviran, it can be unpacked in 30 seconds and used immediately.|$|R

50|$|Segregation of a solute to {{surfaces}} and grain boundaries in a solid produces {{a section of}} material with a discrete composition and {{its own set of}} properties that can have important (and often deleterious) effects on the overall properties of the material. These ‘zones’ with an increased concentration of solute {{can be thought of as}} the cement between the bricks of a building. The structural integrity of the building depends not only on the material properties of the brick, but also greatly on the properties of the <b>long</b> lines of <b>mortar</b> in between.|$|R

A mortar crew can lob mortars over {{blocking}} terrain and hills and hit unseen targets as <b>long</b> as the <b>mortar</b> crew has a spotter. In Tide of Iron, any fresh friendly squad that does have line of sight to the intended target can direct the mortar crew's fire. This simulates radio contact between the mortar crew and spotter. Unlike other infantry figures, mortar crews don't fire at specific enemy units (squads and vehicles). Rather they target a specific hex as a whole. Any enemy unit within the targeted hex {{at the time of}} firing is in harm's way.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research discussed in this thesis was to evaluate the methods and materials used by builders in ancient Ostia to produce mortar for masonry structures. The work was conducted {{with an eye toward}} understanding why the ancient builders selected specific materials and employed specific techniques. The research design included scientific investigations of mortar samples from selected structures in Ostia, all dated from brick stamp evidence to the 2 nd century CE. The methods employed for this study included thin section petrography, modal analysis via point counting, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and image analysis. Results concluded the samples comprised lime binder and primarily volcanic tuff aggregates derived from the Colli Albani and Monti Sabatini volcanic districts. The selection of these aggregates was integral to mortar performance, as they contained alteration products that would have facilitated pozzolanic reactions during the production phase, greatly improving <b>long</b> term <b>mortar</b> performance and durability. Three distinct types of mortar representing unique mix designs were identified based on the material properties of the mortar samples and the dominant aggregate types. Unique mixes may have been proprietary to specific groups of builders in Ostia, which had been identified by other researchers comparing the architectural features and construction styles of various structures. The results of material analyses showed that the builders from 2 nd century Ostia were highly skilled, used sophisticated techniques to produce high quality mortar, and that separate groups of builders employed unique mix designs to achieve similar results. </p...|$|R
40|$|When {{a mortar}} {{is applied to}} a porous {{substrate}} like brick or stone, water is exchanged between both materials. The early water transport {{is important for the}} workability of the mortar and for the final properties in the hardened state. It determines how <b>long</b> a <b>mortar</b> can be shaped, be it bedding mortar, plaster or render. The equilibrium water content of the mortar will influence the extent of the hydration reaction and the shrinkage. Also bond and water permeability of the hardened masonry are affected by this water flow. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the phenomena, to identify the important parameters and governing mechanisms. Water transport between mortar and brick was monitored during the first two hours after contact, by using microfocus X-ray imaging. This technique presents a practical and quick alternative for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and neutron radiography. The hygric properties of a lime hydrate mortar were determined experimentally. The essential concept is that the mortar is considered as a compacting material, of which the properties change when water is desorbed from it. Data were obtained in suction tests, pressure filtration tests and permeameter tests. A model for calculation of water transport between mortar and brick is proposed by coupling a generalised Darcy equation for both materials. For the mortar the spatial units are defined in (Lagrangian) material coordinates, which follow the material while compacting. Diffusivity and potential curves are derived from the experiments, using simple empirical equations from filtration theory. The differences between the simulation and the observations from X-ray experiments are analysed in the context of the interface resistance. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Jamu {{is claimed}} to have {{originated}} in the Mataram Kingdom era, some 1300 years ago. The stone mortar and pestle with <b>long</b> cylindrical stone <b>mortar</b> — the type commonly used in today's traditional jamu making, was discovered in Liyangan archaeological site on the slope of Mount Sundoro, Central Java. The site and relics are dated from Medang Mataram kingdom era circa 8th to 10th century, which suggest that the herbal medicine tradition of jamu already took its roots by then. The bas-reliefs on Borobudur depicts the image of people ground something with stone mortar and pestle, drink seller, physician and masseuse treating their clients. All of these scenes might {{be interpreted as a}} traditional herbal medicine and health-related treatments in ancient Java. The Madhawapura inscription from Majapahit period mentioned a specific profession of herbs mixer and combiner (herbalist), called Acaraki. The medicine book from Mataram dated from circa 1700 contains 3,000 entries of jamu recipes, while Javanese classical literature Serat Centhini (1814) describes some jamu herbal concoction recipes.|$|R
2500|$|Bolstered to nine M113s, 3 Troop again {{moved forward}} through the {{artillery}} fire with Roberts spreading the additional APCs across {{the rear of}} his formation for depth. Utilising a track as a guide he reformed the troop into a wide assault formation. Beginning the advance at 18:55, 3 Troop prepared for a frontal assault on the Viet Cong force. Continuing past D Company to their left, the relief force moved forward rapidly, firing their machine-guns. A brief but heavy engagement occurred, with the Viet Cong responding with automatic fire, including tracer and explosive rounds, which enveloped 3 Troop from their front and left, but was mostly high. Arriving at a crucial point in the fighting, the relief force turned the tide of the battle. The Viet Cong had been massing for another assault which would likely have destroyed D Company, yet the additional firepower and mobility of the armoured force broke their will to fight, forcing them to break contact and begin to withdraw as night approached. At 19:00 the 32 men from B Company finally entered D Company's position, even as the cavalry continued to assault the Viet Cong. After a <b>long</b> approach under <b>mortar</b> fire {{and the threat of}} ambush by a superior force, Smith placed Ford on the western side of the D Company defensive position to act as a screen to allow them to treat their wounded and prepare to resist a counter-attack. 3 Troop swept forward with the APCs continuing to assault a further [...] before Townsend ordered their return. Turning north-west, Roberts moved back to the company location at 19:10. Yet even as they did so the Viet Cong continued to attack from the north-east, although this too was soon broken off.|$|R
