5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for housekeeping and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In {{the course of that}} housekeeping, in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located in his apartment and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same housekeeping session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a tape recorder in his apartment, taking the tapes into the studio later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces,</b> is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E

25|$|As {{time went}} on, Franklin {{depended}} less on his literary conventions, {{and more on}} his own native humor. In this {{there is a new}} spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of Addison, or the bitter irony of Swift, or the stinging completeness of Pope. The brilliant <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> Franklin wrote for his Pennsylvania Gazette have an imperishable place in American literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversial}} book A Million <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> by James Frey {{takes place}} in part {{in and around the}} city of St. Joseph. Many of the disputed parts took place in the area. James went to St. Joseph High School. Some members of the area including local police helped to show that the book was not a complete factual recount but partly a fictional retelling of events.|$|E

25|$|On September 12, 2006, Frey and {{publisher}} Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, whereby readers {{who felt that}} they had been defrauded by Frey's A Million <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers had to submit a proof of purchase, pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hardcover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they had purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.|$|E

In series 2 in 1982, Carling actually fills out an army application form, but when he asks Alex Drake to write a reference, she takes the form and rips it up into <b>little</b> <b>pieces,</b> convincing him to stay.|$|E
25|$|On November 2, 2007, the Associated Press {{published}} {{a story about}} a judgment in favor of readers who felt deceived by Frey's claims of A Million <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> being a memoir. Although the publisher, Random House, had set aside $2.35million for lawsuits, only 1,729 readers came forward to receive a refund for the book. The refund offer was extended to anyone who had purchased the book prior to Frey's disclosing the falsehoods therein. Chicago lawyer Larry D. Drury, defending the plaintiff, received approximately $1.3million for legal fees, distribution of the legal notice, and charitable donations to three charities, while total claimants' refunds issued to readers only came to $27,348. The publisher also agreed to provide a disclosure {{at the beginning of the}} book, citing the somewhat fictitious nature of the text.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{featured}} a monthly book highlight, including author interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot {{to the top}} of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, featuring more classic works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The original format was reintroduced in September 2005, but Winfrey's selection of James Frey's A Million <b>Little</b> <b>Pieces</b> became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw Elie Wiesel's Night selected; Winfrey even traveled to Auschwitz with Wiesel. In 2008, Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth was selected. Modernizing the book club's platform, Winfrey and Tolle began a series of live webcast classes that were streamed on Oprah.com to discuss elements of the book with a worldwide audience.|$|E
