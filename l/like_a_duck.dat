25|$|Vandervert (1980/1988) {{described}} in scientific detail a simple, everyday illustration of an operational definition {{in terms of}} making a cake (i.e., its recipe is an operational definition used in a specialized laboratory known as the household kitchen). Similarly, the saying, if it walks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> and quacks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck,</b> it must be some kind of duck, may be regarded as involving a sort of measurement process or set of tests (see duck test).|$|E
25|$|Verites is a {{contraction}} of Oliverites (Oliver Walford, School Usher 1838–55) and hence 'Verites' is pronounced {{as if the}} 'Ver' is from Oliver not as from 'very'. The records of the house run back {{to the start of}} the last century, but previously it was just called 'Boarders House No.2'. Girdlestonites' first housemaster was Frederick Girdlestone, who was said to walk <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck.</b> Girdlestonites has therefore been unofficially known as 'Duckites' ever since, but since this was 'insulting' slang it was never written down or used officially. This latter restriction has now largely fallen by the wayside and even the school magazine uses Duckites in print occasionally.|$|E

Later, she wrote: [...] "I took to photography <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> to water. I never wanted to do anything else." [...] Ray was impressed by her darkroom work and allowed her to use his studio to take her own photographs. In 1926, she exhibited her work in the gallery [...] "Au Sacre du Printemps" [...] and started her own studio on the rue du Bac. After a short time studying photography in Berlin, she returned to Paris in 1927 and started a second studio, on the rue Servandoni.|$|E

Police were tipped off by Whitney Donahue, who noticed the parked car. (Four hours earlier, Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose had relayed this cryptic message to the sniper: [...] "You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things. [...] You have asked us to say, 'We have caught the sniper <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> in a noose.' We understand that hearing us say this is important to you". Moose asked the media [...] "to carry the message accurately and often." [...] This mysterious and arguable reference to a Cherokee fable has never been explained.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Union army {{managed to}} escape {{complete}} disaster because of the stout defense organized by Thomas on Horseshoe Ridge, heroism that earned him the nickname [...] "Rock of Chickamauga." [...] The army withdrew that night to fortified positions in Chattanooga. Bragg had not succeeded in his objective to destroy the Army of the Cumberland, but the Battle of Chickamauga was nonetheless the worst Union defeat in the Western Theater. Thomas urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted {{to prop up the}} morale of his general, telegraphing [...] "Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers.

2500|$|Thomas {{withdrew the}} {{remainder}} of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw while his commander and peers fled earned him the nickname Rock of Chickamauga, derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, [...] "Thomas is standing like a rock." [...] Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that [...] "our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full." [...] Although the troops were tired and hungry, and nearly out of ammunition, he continued, [...] "I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory." [...] He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga.

2500|$|To see David Campese in seven-a-side {{play was}} another delight. The {{abbreviated}} version {{seemed to be}} made for him. Of course it was invented near my home area of the Scottish border country at Melrose and there was massive interest in the appearance of David Campese in a Randwick squad who were special guests in 1990 at the ‘Blue Riband’ of the spring sevens series, the Melrose tournament. Came the day and the rain simply teemed down on a pitch that was treacherous to say the least. The local players rubbed their hands in gleeful anticipation. Here was the weather and ground conditions to which they were accustomed and in which they could revel. Such hazardous conditions would cut the famous Wallaby down to size. The Borderers would show the great man how it should be done. Some hope! He was the star of the show, the tournament’s top try-scorer and points-scorer with 44 of Randwick’s 92 points. Not only that but he was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> in water, completely at home, fizzing about in the ‘glaur’, the Border name for cloying mud, as to the manner born. He had been preparing himself for water sports having previously asked that his Melrose billet should have a swimming pool! He saved Randwick from semi-final defeat with a typical touch of Campese magic. Randwick were 15-12 in arrears to Melrose with time almost up when he received the ball at halfway and took off like an inebriated skater. Some metres short of the goal line he produced a dive that would have dome credit to an Olympic swimmer and slithered his way to a momentous try that took Randwick to the final in which they beat the renowned sevens artistes from Kelso who included the famous ‘White Shark’, John Jeffrey. David admitted afterwards that he was grateful for the rain and mud: ‘I wouldn’t have scored that try on a dry day because I {{would not have been able}} to aquaplane into the corner.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the good}} points about the tour so far had been the rise of Trevor Bailey as new ball partner for Alec Bedser. He bowled the first over, but mistimed his run {{up for the first}} ball and had to walk back and start again, {{swinging}} his fourth ball to tickle the edge of Jack Moroney's bat and send it to Len Hutton at fine leg for a duck. Neil Harvey joined Arthur Morris and they took the score to 66/1 by lunch, though Morris constantly played and missed at Bedser's in-swingers and made only 24 runs to 38 by the more fluent Harvey. Doug Wright (1/81) came on to bowl a typical over with two long hops, which Harvey cracked into the square-leg fence, but the first ball of the next had him groping at a googly that turned so fiercely that it missed both bat and stumps, [...] "a real pearl that morally bowled Harvey all the way". The following ball had Wright appealing for lbw, but it was turned down as it turned so much that it would have missed the stumps. Returning after the break Bedser dismissed the labouring Morris lbw to bring Keith Miller on at 69/2. England's fielding had dramatically improved over its reputation on tour – Bedser had bowled seven eight ball overs for 6 runs – but these two strokemakers increased the run rate much to the joy of the crowd. Miller hit a typical Doug Wright over for 12 as he served up a mixture of full tosses, long hops, googlies, fierce leg-breaks and cunningly flighted balls. Harvey's 50 with 6 boundaries brought a cheer from the crowd, and he hit 3 more, a cover-drive and a pull off Bedser and dancing three steps down the wicket to hit Wright to the sightscreen. The Kent spinner returned to the wicket with his hop, skip and a jump and bowled a googly that Miller mishit it to a surprised Arthur McIntyre at short mid-on to have him out for 15. Lindsay Hassett was almost out first ball to Bedser, but a difficult chance was missed by Denis Compton and the Australian captain took a single. Bedser then bowled one of his rare out-swingers to Neil Harvey, Godfrey Evans taking the catch and whipping off the bails to have the Victorian left-hander caught and stumped, but the bowler's umpire responded first and Harvey was [...] "c. Evans b. Bedser" [...] for 74. Hassett did not survive long, his off-stump was knocked over by a Bedser [...] "special" [...] and from 116/2 Australia had collapsed to 129/5. Freddie Brown came on the relieve Bedser and Evans took another great catch to remove Loxton (24), though Ray Lindwall (41) saw Australia to tea for 166/6. Brown (2/63) continued after the break, mixing up his medium-paced seamers with leg-spin to have the out of form Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon caught by Reg Simpson on the square leg boundary at 172/7. Lindwall and Ian Johnson held things up for three-quarters of an hour while adding 47 before Bailey (3/28) took the new ball. Simpson caught Johnson off Bailey and Bedser took Lindwall to give Bailey his third wicket. Bedser was brought back on and Bill Johnston flipped him over the slips to the boundary. As he came to a halt half way down the pitch he stopped to chat with Alec while Iverson completed two runs. Only now did Johnston realise that Reg Simpson had stopped the ball and was throwning it in to Evans. He ran back towards his crease running <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>duck</b> trying to take off from water alongside Iverson making his third run. Johnston got home, Iverson stopped two yards short to turn back to the bowlers end, but Evans missed the bowler's stumps and he was safe. After this comedy routine Bedser (4/45) had Bill Johnston caught by Hutton in the slips to dismiss Australia for 228 ten minutes before stumps, the last 4 wickets falling for just 9 runs. This low score after Australia had chosen to bat on a good wicket was a coup for the touring team, whose performance surprised everyone, it now only remained to see how well their batsmen could perform.|$|E
