Aiming to the {{advantages}} of traditional manual mechanical adjustment for gaps between key parts of <b>offset</b> <b>machine,</b> a method for gaps adjusting automatically was proposed and a prototype of adjusting device based on BR 622 <b>offset</b> <b>machine</b> was formed. In this research, the principle of adjustment automatically was discussed, the configuration with the ARM controller as core of adjustment automatically system was designed, the control software process was analyzing and a prototype was developed. Finally, a method based on gray model is used to predict the trend of <b>offset</b> <b>machine.</b> The method of automatic adjustment for gap can simplify the operations and has practical significance...|$|R

There is a need to investigate the reasons behind and the possible solutions for, the lack of trust between these two groups. Forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> in Ockelbo municipality where interviewed in October 2015. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were asked to subjectively grade their level of trust on a scale of 1 to 10 were 1 was the lowest and 10 was the highest. The results showed the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> trust in the cutting planners averaged 6. 9. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> expressed a clear preference for cutting planners who had practical experience operating a forest machine...|$|R

Figures from Holmen Skog show low reporting frequency. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reason and find suggestions for improvement. A total of 17 <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were interviewed using a questionnaire combined with open questions. The results show that the majority of the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> find it simple to use the reporting system, although, some of them reports that it doesn’t always work as supposed to. About 25 percent of the interviewed answered that the reason for low reporting frequency is the lack of timber order number. To solve this specific problem increased routine among production leaders is needed. Other suggestions of actions aiming to increase the reporting frequency are using a production technician for support of the production leaders make it possible for <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> to report service stops Finally, most of <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> sees the reporting as a natural part of their job and are positive concerning their relation to Holmen Skog...|$|R
