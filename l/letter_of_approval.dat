Previous studies emphasizing similarities {{of language and}} meter, without definite tests of verse rhetoric, {{may lead to the}} false assumption that because Layamon's method is not French, it is fundamentally that of Anglo-Saxon poetry.

40|$|The twin {{objectives}} of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are to assist developing country host nations in achieving sustainable development, and to assist developed countries in meeting their greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction targets. This is achieved through implementing GHG abatement projects in developing countries. There has been increased attention in the contribution of CDM projects to sustainable development in host nations. Previous research has suggested that, when left to market forces, the CDM does not contribute effectively to sustainable development. One likely reason is that host nations define and evaluate projects contribution to sustainable development. This {{has led to a}} “race to bottom” with regard to setting sustainability standards triggered by a concern that project developers prioritise CDM investments in countries with lower sustainability standards. Researchers have identified the need for an international standard for assessing sustainable development benefits of CDM projects. The main aim of this research was to develop an international level framework for assessing sustainable development benefits of CDM projects with a specific focus on landfill gas (LFG) projects. An in-depth literature review was carried out to establish the link between sustainable development benefits of CDM projects in general, and LFG CDM projects in particular. A case study methodology was used to develop an understanding of landfill management practices at three existing landfill sites both in developed (n= 1) and developing countries (n= 2). The results from the literature review and case studies were utilized to develop the framework for assessing sustainable development benefits of LFG CDM projects. The developed framework comprises three sustainable development dimensions and 12 criteria with 16 matching indicators. Such a project specific assessment framework has not previously been developed. The results from the validation of the framework suggested that technology transfer is the most likely benefit of any LFG CDM project while balance of payments is the least likely benefit. The proposed framework can be utilised at two stages in a CDM project lifecycle. It can be used as: (i) a template to guide host nations’ Designated National Authorities (DNAs) on how to review projects before issuing <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Approval</b> (LoA); and (ii) Designated Operating Entities (DOEs) can also use the developed framework to validate and verify that sustainable development benefits stated in project proposals have been realised at the project level...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (Banking and Stock Exchange Law) Abstract: Money {{laundering}} {{and terrorist}} financing {{is a global}} issue. The advent of new technologies such as {{the internet and the}} impact of globalisation have forced businesses including banks to re-evaluate their business models. One of the key strategies currently being employed by South African banks is diversification of business interests through the establishment of subsidiary banks throughout the African continent. It is precisely this strategic shift which has exposed weaknesses in the management of money laundering risks as the South African banks are expected to ensure that the home country anti-money laundering standards are imposed on the subsidiary banks. The South African anti-money laundering regime is considered to be strong within the global context. However, the current Financial Intelligence Centre Act was not developed, and does not cater, for the position where home country anti-money laundering standards are to be imposed on subsidiaries. Even if the Act did cater for this position there would need to be intergovernmental agreements in place to give effect to the South African provisions on the subsidiary banks. Additional legislation such as the Banks Act provides for oversight and attempts to ensure that the standards are met to a degree. However, the Banks Act is applicable to the South African banks, and not to the subsidiaries due to sovereignty of state. It does to a degree require agreement between the various regulators of the countries involved. The countries involved in these cross-border acquisitions are often at different phases of their social, political and economic development and may not have the same resources that South Africa has at its disposal. What occurs when there is a conflict between the legislation of the subsidiary and the home country or if it is simply impractical to impose the standards of the home country to the subsidiary? The risk to South African banks and the South African economy are great as apart from a fine from the South African regulator, there could be a perception that the South African banks’ anti-money laundering framework is not as strong as perceived. The South African banking sector is viewed as a first-world sector. A perception that the banking sector has been weakened through cross-border subsidiary bank acquisitions could lead to a loss of international investments, international business or could even be a determining factor in a ratings downgrade to the South African economy. The dissertation was compiled reviewing all applicable legislation of South Africa as well as that countries where banks were acquired as subsidiaries, the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> from the South African Reserve bank together with conditions and duties imposed on the approval, as [...] ...|$|R
