In the first experiment, the levels of late sound arriving from four directions, namely, lateral, frontal, overhead, and back, are independently varied. The results reconfirm that not only the <b>lateral</b> <b>level,</b> but also the levels of late sound from above and behind the listener affect LEV significantly. In the second experiment, directional late energy ratios are varied keeping the total level of late energy constant.

We evaluated left ventricular function using echocardiography and the effect of treatment with rosuvastatin in a group of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (HC) and without evidence of coronary heart disease and 25 aged matched healthy volunteers (C) were submitted to conventional echocardiography, pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (PWTDI), color Doppler myocardial imaging (CDMI) and integrated backscatter (IBS). Echocardiographic evaluation was repeated after 6 months of treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg/day) in 17 patients. Compared with C, patients with HC showed lower E/A ratio (p< 0. 0001) and higher Tei index mit (p< 0. 0001), as well as lower PW TDI E/A both at septum (p< 0. 0001) and at <b>lateral</b> <b>level</b> (p< 0. 0001) and higher modified Tei index both at septal annulus (p< 0. 0001) and lateral annulus (p< 0. 0001).

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 c, changes in TDI waves e′ and a′ are more {{unidirectional}} {{with the development of}} LVDD. The a′ is an excellent marker of global atrial contraction and has similar values at septal and <b>lateral</b> <b>levels</b> [18]. It correlates very well with LA ejection fraction, LA ejection force and LA kinetic energy [19], being independent from the flow of blood filling the LV. For this reason the a′ does not become smaller, but rather increases with progression of LV diastolic dysfunction and with more vigorous LA contraction in adaptation to the increased pressures. Only with advanced LA dilatation reaching a threshold of fiber length, LA shortening and contractility begin to decline, similar to what happens for the LV (Frank–Starling curve) [20 – 23]. On the other hand, the decline in A wave is likely to happen earlier in the progression of LVDD, because it is related to the reduction in transmitral blood flow in the presence of very high LV filling pressure.|$|R
40|$|Room {{acoustics}} modelling and auralizations {{are very}} useful {{tools in the}} design of acoustically sensitive spaces. One area of improvement for auralizations is the method of modelling the source directivity. A new method to incorporate source directivity is multi-channel auralizations. This study first evaluates the objective effects of using four and thirteen channel impulse responses in an ODEON model of Queen’s Hall, where the actual variable absorption is changed within the model. Analyses of the results reveal great differences in the objective parameters of reverberation time and sound pressure level across each channel’s impulse response. Subjective studies were then conducted to see the effect on multi-channel auralizations of changing source orientation with different amounts of absorption in the modelled room. A significant effect of orientation was not found when subjects were asked to rate the clarity of the auralizations, but clarity ratings were significantly related to room absorption. When asked to rate the listener envelopment, subjects did differentiate between orientations, identifying auralizations with the source facing the audience as sounding more enveloping than when the source faced away. The listener envelopment ratings were also correlated with the calculated late <b>lateral</b> <b>level</b> values. The subjective ratings decreased as the absorption in the room decreased...|$|E

The exposed animals were intoxicated 3 times a day (10 cigarettes per exposure period), 5 days a week. Pulmonary damage was assessed by means of functional tests and quantitative pathological examination of the airways and lung parenchyma. The s- 45 and s- 90 animals were similar in terms of functional residual capacity (FRC) corrected for body weight (FRC/kg) but both groups of smoking rats exhibited significantly higher FRC/kg values than the controls (s- 45 = 6. 33; s- 90 = 6. 46; controls = 3. 78; P< 0. 05).

Our aim is to evaluate whether 2 D strain and strain rate can detect subtle improvement in global and regional LV systolic function immediately after TAVI. 2 D conventional and 2 D strain (speckle analysis) echocardiography was performed before, at discharge and after three months in thirty three patients with severe AS. After TAVI, we assessed by conventional echocardiography an immediate reduction of transaortic peak pressure gradient (p< 0. 0001), of mean pressure gradient (p< 0. 0001) and a concomitant increase in aortic valve area (AVA: 1. 08 ± 0. 31 cm 2 /m 2; p< 0. 0001). 2 D longitudinal systolic strain showed a significant improvement in all patients, both at septal and <b>lateral</b> <b>level,</b> as early as 72 h after procedure (septal: - 14. 2 ± 5. 1 vs - 16. 7 ± 3. 7 %, p< 0. 001; lateral: - 9. 4 ± 3. 9 vs - 13. 1 ± 4. 5 %, p< 0. 001; respectively) and continued at 3 months follow-up (septal: - 18. 1 ± 4. 6 %, p< 0. 0001; lateral: - 14. 8 ± 4. 4 %, p< 0. 0001; respectively).

40|$|AbstractSphingomyelinases (SMases) hydrolyze the {{membrane}} constituent sphingomyelin (SM) to phosphocholine and ceramide (Cer). Growing evidence supports that SMase-induced SM→Cer conversion {{leads to the}} formation of lateral Cer-enriched domains which drive structural reorganization in lipid membranes. We previously provided visual evidence in real-time for the formation of Cer-enriched domains in SM monolayers through the action of the neutral Bacillus cereus SMase. In this work, we disclose a succession of discrete morphologic transitions and lateral organization of Cer-enriched domains that underlay the SMase-generated surface topography. We further reveal how these structural parameters couple to the generation of two-dimensional electrostatic fields, based upon the specific orientation of the lipid dipole moments in the Cer-enriched domains. Advanced image processing routines in combination with time-resolved epifluorescence microscopy on Langmuir monolayers revealed: 1), spontaneous nucleation and circular growth of Cer-enriched domains after injection of SMase into the subphase of the SM monolayer; 2), domain-intrinsic discrete transitions from circular to periodically undulating shapes followed by a second transition toward increasingly branched morphologies; 3), lateral superstructure organization into predominantly hexagonal domain lattices; 4), formation of super-superstructures by the hexagonal lattices; and 5), rotationally and laterally coupled domain movement before domain border contact. All patterns proved to be specific for the SMase-driven system since they could not be observed with Cer-enriched domains generated by defined mixtures of SM/Cer in enzyme-free monolayers at the same surface pressure (Π= 10 mN/m). Following the theories of lateral shape transitions, dipolar electrostatic interactions of lipid domains, and direct determinations of the monolayer dipole potential, our data show that SMase induces a domain-specific packing and orientation of the molecular dipole moments perpendicular to the air/water interface. In consequence, protein-driven generation of specific out-of-equilibrium states, an accepted concept for maintenance of transmembrane lipid asymmetry, must also be considered on the <b>lateral</b> <b>level.</b> Lateral enzyme-specific out-of-equilibrium organization of lipid domains represents a new level of signal transduction from local (nm) to long-range (μm) scales. The cross-talk between lateral domain structures and dipolar electrostatic fields adds new perspectives to the mechanisms of SMase-mediated signal transduction in biological membranes...|$|E

40|$|Obtaining a {{quantitative}} understanding of river–groundwater interactions is of high practical relevance, for instance {{within the context}} of riverbank filtration and river restoration. Modeling interactions between river and groundwater requires knowledge of the river’s spatiotemporal water level distribution. The dynamic nature of riverbed morphology in restored river reaches might result in complex river water level distributions, including disconnected river branches, nonlinear longitudinal water level profiles and morphologically induced <b>lateral</b> water <b>level</b> gradients. Recently, two new methods were proposed to accurately and efficiently capture 2 D water level distributions of dynamic rivers. In this study, we assessed the predictive capability of these methods with respect to simulated groundwater residence times. Both methods were used to generate surface water level distributions of a 1. 2 km long partly restored river reach of the Thur River in northeastern Switzerland. We then assigned these water level distributions as boundary conditions to a 3 D steady-state groundwater flow and transport model. When applying either of the new methods, the calibration-constrained groundwater flow field accurately predicted the spatial distribution of groundwater residence times; deviations were within a range of 30 % when compared to residence times obtained using a reference method. We further tested the sensitivity of the simulated groundwater residence times to a simplified river water level distribution. The negligence of <b>lateral</b> river water <b>level</b> gradients of 20 – 30 cm on a length of 200 m caused errors of 40 – 80 % in the calibration-constrained groundwater residence time distribution compared to results that included <b>lateral</b> water <b>level</b> gradients. The additional assumption of a linear water level distribution in longitudinal river direction led to deviations from the complete river water level distribution of up to 50 cm, which caused wide-spread errors in simulated groundwater residence times of 200 – 500 %. For an accurate simulation of groundwater residence times, it is therefore imperative that the longitudinal water level distribution is correctly captured and described. Based on the confirmed predictive capability of the new methods to estimate 2 D river water level distributions, we can recommend their application to future studies that model dynamic river–groundwater systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} synthetic transmit aperture imaging (STA) {{the image}} is built up {{from a number of}} low resolution images each originating from consecutive single element firings to yield a high resolution image. This lowers the frame rate and may result in motion artifacts. This paper, describes a method in which all transmitting centers can be excited {{at the same time and}} separated at the receiver to yield a full image in only one transmission. Hereby the benefits from traditional STA can be utilized and a high frame rate can be maintained, which thereby prevents motion artifacts. The different centers are excited using mutually orthogonal codes. The signal at the receiver is a linear combination of the transmitted signals convolved with the corresponding pulse-echo impulse response. The pulse-echo impulse responses for the different elements are modeled as finite impulse response channels and estimated using a maximum likelihood technique. The method was verified using simulations in Field II. A 7 MHz transducer was simulated with 128 receiving elements and 64 transmitting elements divided into subapertures so that 4 virtual transmission centers were formed.

Results from computer simulations indicate that a feedback system would function as well as, and potentially better than, a feedforward system. The control results illustrate attenuation of the lateral train-car vibration of up to 15 dB...|$|R
40|$|River {{restoration}} {{measures are}} becoming increasingly popular and are leading to dynamic river bed morphologies that in turn result in complex water level distributions in a river. Disconnected river branches, nonlinear longitudinal water level profiles and morphologically induced <b>lateral</b> water <b>level</b> gradients can evolve rapidly. The modeling of such river-groundwater systems is of high practical relevance {{in order to assess}} the impact of restoration measures on the exchange flux between a river and groundwater or on the residence times between a river and a pumping well. However, the model input includes a proper definition of the river boundary condition, which requires a detailed spatial and temporal river water level distribution. In this study, we present two new methods to estimate river water level distributions that are based directly on measured data. Comparing generated time series of water levels with those obtained by a hydraulic model as a reference, the new methods proved to offer an accurate and faster alternative with a simpler implementatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relation between the arrival direction of late sound and perceived listener envelopment (LEV). In this paper, two kinds of psychological experiments are conducted with three-dimensional simulated sound fields in an anechoic room. Firstly, the eect of late energy arriving from four fundamental directions on perceived LEV is individually investigated. The results show that the <b>lateral</b> sound <b>level</b> gives the highest correlation with LEV, while late sound arriving from overhead and behind the listener also correlates very strongly with LEV. Secondly, whether or not the dierent sound fields with a constant <b>level</b> of late <b>lateral</b> energy lead to significant dierences in perceived LEV is examined. The results clearly indicate that LEV is significantly distinguished due to the late sound having non-lateral components. From these experiments, it is concluded that not only the late lateral sound, but also the late sound from other directions, such as overhead, back and frontal...|$|R
40|$|Knowing the {{concentrations}} of the nutrient elements in soils is important due to their toxic effect on humans and the environment. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the effects of water quality, depths and distances of lateral installation on soil chemical properties during turfgrass cultivation. A field experiment was conducted using a Split Split Plot design based on the Randomized complete Block (RCB) with two treatments (well’s and wastewater), and eight sub-treatments (45 and 60 cm distance of the laterals and 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm depths of laterals) in three replicates on a sandy-loam soil, in Shahrekord, Iran. Soil samples were collected from 0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm depth for measuring nitrate (NO 3 -), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH {{at the end of the}} experiment. During the experiment, fecal coliform (FC) were also measured at the soil surface. Results indicated that by increasing lateral distance, NO 3 - level increased in both layers. With installing <b>laterals</b> in deeper <b>levels,</b> NO 3 - concentration decreased at the beginning, then increased in the first layer, whereas in the second layer NO 3 - concentration decreased. In addition, installing laterals in deeper depth, caused an increase in soil EC in the top layer, but a decrease in the lower layer. However, the results showed that there was no significant effect of experimental factors on soil pH. The results also show that with increasing <b>laterals</b> depth, Fc <b>level</b> decreased at the soil surface...|$|R
