25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926–2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds. Janssen synthesized nearly all of the butyrophenone class of antipsychotic agents, beginning with haloperidol (1958) and droperidol (1961). These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by sufentanil (1974), alfentanil (1976), carfentanil (1976), and <b>lofentanil</b> (1980). Janssen and his team also developed etomidate (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofentanil</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent opioid analgesics known and is an {{analogue}} of fentanyl, which was developed in 1960. It is most similar to the highly potent opioid carfentanil (4-carbomethoxyfentanyl), only slightly more potent. <b>Lofentanil</b> can be described as 3-methylcarfentanil, or 3-methyl-4-carbomethoxyfentanyl. While 3-methylfentanyl is considerably more potent than fentanyl itself, <b>lofentanil</b> is only slightly stronger than carfentanil. This suggests that substitution at both the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring introduces steric hindrance which prevents μ-opioid affinity from increasing much further. As with other 3-substituted fentanyl derivatives such as ohmefentanyl, the stereoisomerism of <b>lofentanil</b> is very important, with some stereoisomers being much more potent than others.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lofentanil</b> is {{very similar}} to {{carfentanil}} in effects, but has a longer duration of action. This makes it unsuitable for most practical applications, with carfentanil being the preferred agent for tranquilizing large animals, and short-acting derivatives such as sufentanil or remifentanil being preferred for medical use in human surgical procedures. The long duration and high lipophilicity of <b>lofentanil</b> has been suggested as an advantage for certain types of analgesia, but the main application for <b>lofentanil</b> at the present time is research into opioid receptors. [...] Side effects of fentanyl analogs {{are similar to those of}} fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea, and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. Side effects from <b>lofentanil</b> might be particularly problematic given its reportedly long duration of action. Another side effect which is characteristic of fentanyl and its derivatives is their tendency to rapidly induce tolerance, due to their high binding affinity triggering rapid internalization of chronically activated opiate receptors. This might be expected to be a particular problem with <b>lofentanil</b> as it is not only one of the most potent drugs in the series, but also is longer acting than most other fentanyl analogues, meaning that development of tolerance triggered by receptor over-activation is likely to be especially rapid, occurring with as little as a single active dose.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{acting on the}} μ-opioid receptor, <b>lofentanil</b> has also been found {{to act as a}} full agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 8.2 nM; EC50 = 153 nM; Emax = 100%).|$|E

50|$|Oxymorphazone is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug related to oxymorphone. Oxymorphazone {{is a potent}} and long acting μ-opioid agonist which binds irreversibly to the receptor, forming a covalent bond which prevents it from detaching once bound. This gives it an unusual pharmacological profile, and while oxymorphazone is only around half the potency of oxymorphone, with higher doses the analgesic effect becomes extremely long lasting, {{with a duration of}} up to 48 hours. However, tolerance to analgesia develops rapidly with repeated doses, as chronically activated opioid receptors are rapidly internalised by β-arrestins, similar to the results of non-covalent binding by repeated doses of agonists with extremely high binding affinity such as <b>lofentanil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In toxicology, {{the median}} toxic dose (TD50) {{of a drug}} or toxin is the dose at which {{toxicity}} occurs in 50% of cases. The type of toxicity should be specified for this value to have meaning for practical purposes. The median toxic dose encompasses the category of toxicity that is greater than half maximum effective concentration (ED50) but less than the median lethal dose (LD50). However, for some highly potent toxins (ex. <b>lofentanil,</b> botulinum toxin) {{the difference between the}} ED50 and TD50 is so minute that the values assigned to them may be approximated to equal doses. Since toxicity need not be lethal, the TD50 is generally lower than the median lethal dose (LD50), and the latter can be considered an upper bound for the former. However, since the toxicity is above the effective limit, the TD50 is generally greater than the ED50. If the result of a study is a toxic effect that does not result in death, it is classified as this form of toxicity. [...] Toxic effects can be defined differently, sometimes considering the therapeutic effect of a substance to be toxic (such as with chemotherapeutics) which can lead to confusion and contention regarding a substance's TD50. Examples of these toxic endpoints include cancer, blindness, anemia, birth defects, etc.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{determined}} the binding domains of sufentanil and <b>lofentanil</b> in the μ opioid receptor by comparing their binding affinities to seven μ/δ and six μ/κ chimeric receptors with those to μ, δ and κ opioid receptors. TMHs 6 and 7 and the e 3 loop of the μ opioid receptor were important for selective binding of sufentanil and <b>lofentanil</b> to the μ over the κ receptor. TMHs 1 – 3 and the e 1 loop of the μ opioid receptor conferred binding selectivity for sufentanil over the δ receptor. Thus, {{the region that}} conferred binding selectivity for sufentanil differs, depending on chimeras used. In addition, the interaction TMHs 1 – 3 and TMHs 6 – 7 was crucial for the high affinity binding of these two ligands. These two regions are likely to contain sites of interaction with the ligands or to confer conformations specific to the μ receptor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand β-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. Results Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44, 441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = β-endorphin > etorphine = <b>lofentanil</b> = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = dezocine = metazocine ≥ xorphanol. The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = <b>lofentanil</b> > metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> β-endorphin. Conclusion These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ORL 1 (Opioid Receptor-Like) {{receptor}} is the G protein-coupled receptor whose {{amino acid}} sequence is closest to those of opioid receptors. Residues that are conserved in ORL 1 and {{the three types of}} opioid receptor, but also a residue, His in the sixth putative transmembrane (TM 6) helix, which is present in all opioid receptor types but absent in ORL 1, appear to {{play a key role in}} receptor recognition and/or activation. Here we have sought to create an opioid binding pocket in the non-opioid ORL 1 receptor by replacing residue Gln 280 in its TM 6 by the corresponding His residue of opioid receptors. The mutation affects neither the affinity of nociceptin - the natural ORL 1 agonist - for the receptor, nor the potency of nociceptin to inhibit adenylyl cyclase via ORL 1. In contrast, we find that a few opioid ligands, the agonists <b>lofentanil,</b> etorphine and dynorphin A, and especially the antagonists diprenorphine and nor-BNI, bind the mutant Q 280 H receptor with substantially (5 - to > 100 -fold) higher apparent affinity than they do the wild-type receptor. Moreover, <b>lofentanil</b> and etorphine no longer act as pure agonists, as they do at the native ORL 1 receptor, but are endowed with clear antagonist properties at the mutant receptor. The mutation Q 280 H, which increases affinity while decreasing intrinsic activity of opioids at ORL 1, emphasizes the importance of the His residue for opioid recognition and activation...|$|E

40|$|Fentanyl, {{a potent}} opioid, is used widely during general anaesthesia. It {{contains}} an ionizable nitrogen which, {{according to its}} pK ^ undergoes dissociation within physiological and pathological pH ranges. As a result, the tissue distribution of fentanyl should depend critically upon the fraction which is ionized, since the water and lipid solubility of the free base, and of the charged form of the drug, differ markedly. The present study was prompted by two considerations: first, there are several reports which describe an augmentation of the action of fentanyl when artificial ventilation is terminated {{at the end of}} surgery (Becker et al., 1976; Stoeckel, Hengstmann and Schuttler, 1979; McQuay et al., 1979; McClain and Hug, 1980). The enhanced activity is accompanied by an increase in the plasma concentration of fentanyl ("secondary peak"). Second, the recent availability of two congeners of fentanyl which differ from the mother compound with respect to hydrophobicity (<b>lofentanil)</b> or both pK, and hydrophobicity (alfentanil). To study the distribution of these opioids between an aqueous phase and tissue we used isolated, electrically stimulated guineapig atria which were shown to contract in the pH range 7. 0 - 8. 5. An intact function of the chosen tissue was considered essential since, otherwise, the accumu-lation of the drugs might be altered by damaged cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} fentanyl in serum and urine. The ELISA used an indirect competitive method produced by coating the plate with thyroglobulin conjugated with fentanyl hapten. Antibodies against fentanyl-hemocyanin were detected by a goat-anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Calibration standard curves ranged from 0. 5 ng/ml to 50 mu g/ml (IC 50 = 10 ng/ml), and the limits of detection were 0. 5 and 1. 0 ng/ml for serum and urine, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay variations were less than 8 % and 10 %, respectively. The antibody produced against fentanyl completely cross-reacted with p-fluorofentanyl, thienylfentanyl and 3 -methylthienylfentanyl, cross-reacted highly with carfentanil (85 %), but was considered non-cross-reactive with a-methylfentanyl (5 %), sufentanil (< 1 %), alfentanil (< 1 %) and <b>lofentanil</b> (< 1 %). Nano-sized iron oxide magnetic particles coated with the developed fentanyl antibody were capable of specific binding and releasing of fentanyl from urine samples. This enabled the drug to be effectively pre-concentrated and decreased the limit of detection by approximately one order of magnitude. The analytical background noise was significantly reduced to enable fentanyl detection at concentrations originally below chromatographic limit of detection. The change of platform for antibody binding with nanoparticles demonstrated a novel use of antibodies for sample preparation and should facilitate drug screening by traditional ELISA.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the activation profiles of 15 opioid ligands in transfected human embryonic kidney cells expressing only δ opioid receptors. Activation profiles of most of these ligands at δ opioid receptors had not been previously characterized in vitro. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Results Naltrexone and nalorphine were classified as antagonists at δ opioid receptor. The other ligands studied were agonists at δ opioid receptors and demonstrated IC 50 values of 0. 1 nM to 2 μM, maximal inhibition of 39 – 77 % and receptor binding affinities of 0. 5 to 243 nM. The rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested was metazocine = xorphanol ≥ fentanyl = SKF 10047 = etorphine = hydromorphone = butorphanol = <b>lofentanil</b> > WIN 44, 441 = Nalbuphine = cyclazocine ≥ met-enkephalin >> morphine = dezocine. For the first time these data describe and compare the function and relative efficacy of several ligands at δ opioid receptors. Conclusions The data produced from this study can lead to elucidation of the complete activation profiles of several opioid ligands, leading to clarification of the mechanisms involved in physiological effects of these ligands at δ opioid receptors. Furthermore, these data can be used as a basis for novel use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology at δ opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
