25|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{was devoted}} to his {{daughter}} and tried to raise Christina like a boy. At the age of two, she clapped her hands and <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> joy when the great cannons of Kalmar Castle boomed out the royal salute. Afterwards, Gustavus Adolphus often took his daughter with him to military reviews. Maria Eleonora showed little affection for her daughter and was not allowed any influence in Christina's upbringing. The princess {{was placed in the}} care of Gustavus Adolphus' half-sister Catherine and the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even to stick it out in the internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.|$|E

500|$|According to the Ramayana, when Ila {{approached}} Shiva for help, Shiva <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> scorn but the compassionate Parvati {{reduced the}} curse and allowed Ila to switch genders every month. However, {{as a male}} he would not remember {{his life as a}} female and vice versa. While Ilā roamed the forest in her new form with her female attendants, Budha, the god of the planet Mercury and the son of the moon-god Chandra, noticed her. Although he had been practising asceticism, Ilā's beauty caused him {{to fall in love with}} her at first sight. Budha turned Ilā's attendants into Kimpurushas (hermaphrodite, lit. [...] "is it a man?") and ordered them to run away, promising that they would find mates as Ilā had.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to take forever to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny but trying to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers figure out which ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of an American {{military}} officer, the British missionary of the [...] "Two by Twos" [...] Ernest Stanley was [...] "the most hated man in camp."

On the eve of the liberation, he conversed and <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> everyone including high-ranking American Army officers. Speculation arose that he was either a spy or a member of British intelligence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt {{ultimately}} {{decided to}} rescind the order. Brander Matthews, {{a friend of}} Roosevelt {{and one of the}} chief advocates of the reform as chairman of the Simplified Spelling Board, remonstrated with him for abandoning the effort. Roosevelt replied on December 16, 1906: [...] "I could not by fighting have kept the new spelling in, and it was evidently worse than useless to go into an undignified contest when I was beaten. Do you know that the one word as to which I thought the new spelling was wrong – thru – was more responsible than anything else for our discomfiture?" [...] Next summer Roosevelt was watching a naval review when a press boat marked [...] "Pres Bot" [...] chugged ostentatiously by. The President waved and <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> delight.|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} one day, Rabbi Eliezer {{employed}} every imaginable {{argument for the}} proposition that {{a particular type of}} oven was not susceptible to ritual impurity, but the Sages did not accept his arguments. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, then let this carob tree prove it," [...] and the carob tree moved 100 cubits (and others say 400 cubits) out of its place. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a carob tree. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let this stream of water prove it," [...] and the stream of water flowed backwards. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a stream of water. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of this house of study prove it," [...] and the walls leaned over as if to fall. But Rabbi Joshua rebuked the walls, telling them not to interfere with scholars engaged in a halachic dispute. In honor of Rabbi Joshua, the walls did not fall, but in honor of Rabbi Eliezer, the walls did not stand upright, either. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let Heaven prove it," [...] and a Heavenly Voice cried out: [...] "Why do you dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, for in all matters the halachah agrees with him!" [...] But Rabbi Joshua rose and exclaimed in the words of [...] "It is not in heaven." [...] Rabbi Jeremiah explained that God had given the Torah at Mount Sinai; Jews pay no attention to Heavenly Voices, for God wrote in [...] "After the majority must one incline." [...] Later, Rabbi Nathan met Elijah and asked him what God did when Rabbi Joshua rose in opposition to the Heavenly Voice. Elijah replied that God <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> joy, saying, [...] "My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me!" ...|$|E
