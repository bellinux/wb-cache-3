5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that <b>laches</b> barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and <b>Laches,</b> overlooking him on account of his youth.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} Indian tribes {{have a common}} law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon {{aboriginal}} title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and {{that the cause of}} action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of <b>laches,</b> a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.|$|E

In 1999 Fortified released <b>Lach’s</b> second album Blang!, produced by Richard Barone (The Bongos).|$|R
5|$|Oneida I and Oneida II were litigated as {{test cases}} by both sides; the Oneidas {{suit against the}} {{counties}} for 200 years of damages was stayed pending its resolution. After settlement efforts, that suit resumed in 2000. In a similar suit by a different tribe, the Second Circuit adopted {{the view of the}} four dissenting Oneida II justices in Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki (2005). The same <b>laches</b> defense defeated the larger Oneida claim. The Oneida and the United States petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari on May 16, 2011. The Court denied certiorari on October 17, with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissenting from the denial.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{defendants}} claimed the affirmative defense of <b>laches,</b> asserting that Steinberg had waited over {{six months to}} complain to Columbia Pictures about the alleged infringement {{in order to increase}} his award in the eventual lawsuit. The court dismissed this allegation on the grounds that Steinberg had registered his complaint with {{the defendants}} within weeks of beginning their advertising campaign, and that a six-month delay between publication of the allegedly infringing work and instigation of a lawsuit was not sufficient to establish a claim of <b>laches.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that <b>laches</b> is a ‘somewhat uncertain’ doctrine. There is {{authority}} that an innocent party must have known of a right to rescind before time starts to run, which seems to contradict the decision in Leaf.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} {{heard in the}} Southern District of New York in front of Judge Louis L. Stanton. The defendants, {{including}} Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., RCA Corporation, and several major newspapers, denied Steinberg's allegations of copyright infringement and asserted the affirmative defenses of (1) fair use as a parody, (2) estoppel, and (3) <b>laches.</b> Both parties moved for summary judgment.|$|E
25|$|Superior Court Judge F.

50|$|<b>Lach</b> came to Greenwich Village (New York City) in {{the early}} 1980s, heading {{straight}} for Folk City. However it seemed <b>Lach’s</b> renowned punk/folk style was not welcome and so {{he moved to the}} Lower East Side, opening his own illegal after-hours club, The Fort. The same week <b>Lach</b> opened The Fort, Folk City held the New York Folk Festival, and so, <b>Lach</b> held the first New York Antifolk Festival. The first wave of Antifolk was born.|$|R

25|$|Both {{an order}} for {{specific}} performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating {{for the most part}} in equity. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as <b>laches,</b> the bona fide purchaser rule, or unclean hands) may act as a bar to specific performance.|$|E
25|$|This {{precedent}} {{has effectively}} ended {{the viability of}} all aboriginal title litigation in the Second Circuit (Connecticut, New York, and Vermont), the site of {{nearly all of the}} unresolved Indian land claims in the United States. Since the ruling, no tribal plaintiff has overcome the <b>laches</b> defense in a land claim in the Second Circuit. Four dissenting Supreme Court justices had previously adopted the view of the Second Circuit in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (1985); there, the majority did not reach the issue.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for trial, {{the court}} {{threw out the}} plaintiff's real estate expert and {{approved}} the government's real estate expert, applying the Daubert standard. He also clarified his prior ruling, to note that testimony on <b>laches</b> would be permitted inasmuch as it related to pre-judgement interest. In 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Cayuga, calculating damages the current fair {{market value of the}} land and the fair rental value of the land over 204 years in excess of $36 million; with the addition of pre-judgement interest, the damages reached $247,911,999.42. The court also denied the defendant's post-trial motions, but stayed the collection of the judgement pending appeal.|$|E

50|$|In the 1952-53 season, <b>Lach</b> won {{his third}} and final Stanley Cup in a memorable finish. In the 1953 Stanley Cup Final against the Boston Bruins, <b>Lach</b> scored the cup-winning goal at 1:22 of {{overtime}} in the fifth game of the series. In the on-ice celebration immediately after the goal, Maurice Richard accidentally broke <b>Lach's</b> nose with his stick. In 1953-54, <b>Lach</b> was again held back by injuries and his place was taken by another great, Jean Béliveau, whom he tutored in faceoffs. When the playoffs began, <b>Lach</b> {{was no longer a}} full-time player, but he was inserted into the lineup in the 1954 Stanley Cup Final when Montreal fell behind in the series. Montreal extended the series to seven games, but ultimately lost.|$|R

On the 7th play after halftime, <b>Lach</b> broke a 61-yard run for a touchdown at Groves Stadium, against Wake Forest University, on October 26. Wes McAfee tossed a 13-yard pass to <b>Lach</b> against Georgia Tech {{in the second quarter}} to complete a 54-yard drive. <b>Lach</b> was one of four Blue Devils selected to the eleven man Southern Conference 1940 Associated Press honor team.|$|R
500|$|The {{majority}} {{noted that}} the four dissenting justices would have barred the Oneida's claim under <b>laches.</b> However, the majority noted that [...] "we do not reach this issue today" [...] because the District Court had ruled against the counties <b>laches</b> defense, and the counties had not raised {{the issue in the}} Second Circuit. In a footnote, the majority opined that [...] "application of the equitable defense of <b>laches</b> in an action at law would be novel indeed." [...] The same footnote cited [...] Ewert v. Bluejacket, 259 U.S. 129 (1922) for the proposition that <b>laches</b> [...] "cannot properly have application to give vitality to a void deed and to bar the rights of Indian wards in lands subject to statutory restrictions."

500|$|The dissenters noted various {{historical}} {{examples of}} the Court applying <b>laches</b> to Indian equitable claims, and argued that the doctrine should also {{be applied to the}} action of ejectment (which they admitted was an action at law, not equity). Specifically, they cited [...] "hree decisions of this Court illustrate the application of the doctrine of <b>laches</b> to actions seeking to set aside conveyances made in violation of federal law."

50|$|On September 14, 1942 <b>Lach</b> {{caught a}} pass from Bud Schwenk {{to account for}} the game's only touchdown, in the Cardinals' 7-0 victory over the Cleveland Rams, at Civic Stadium in Buffalo, New York. The 6-yard toss was batted by <b>Lach</b> with his left hand and then caught by him behind Bill Conkright. Against the Detroit Lions at Comiskey Park, Schwenk pounced on a loose ball fumbled by Harry Hopp on the last play of the third quarter. Schwenk then found right halfback <b>Lach</b> from the Lions' 20-yard-line for a touchdown, on the first play of the last period. The Green Bay Packers {{defeated}} the Cardinals despite trailing 13-10 midway through the fourth quarter in Chicago, on October 4. Once again the aerial combination of Schwenk passing to <b>Lach</b> dominated the highlights. <b>Lach</b> received a 20-yard pass and then raced in from the 15 in the first quarter. <b>Lach</b> accounted for one of two touchdowns the Cardinals made during a lopsided loss to the Chicago Bears on October 11.Schwenk lofted a 47-yard strike to <b>Lach</b> {{in the first quarter of}} a game witnessed by 38,500 fans.|$|R

500|$|The {{meaning of}} the term [...] "redskin" [...] was {{addressed}} in two cases challenging the trademark registrations held by Pro-Football, Inc., the team's corporate entity. The challange was based upon a disparagement provision of the Lanham Act which prohibited the registration of any mark that “may disparage persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.” The first case, Harjo etal. v Pro-Football, Inc. was filed in 1992 by Suzan Shown Harjo and six other Native American leaders. In 1999 the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) canceled the federal registrations for the Redskins marks. In 2005 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia reversed the TTAB's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals were also rejected on the basis of <b>laches,</b> that the Native American petitioners had pursued their rights in an untimely manner.|$|E
