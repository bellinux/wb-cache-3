5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the <b>licensing</b> <b>body</b> while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

(2) That from and after this date no examination shall be accepted as satisfactory from any <b>licensing</b> <b>body</b> except such as has been carried on in part by examiners appointed by the <b>licensing</b> <b>body,</b> and in part by coadjutor-examiners of equal authority appointed by the Medical Council or other central authority, and acting under their instructions.|$|E
