5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting <b>Libya</b> in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, <b>Libya</b> stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that <b>Libya</b> hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against <b>Libya</b> which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised <b>Libya</b> for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when <b>Libya</b> agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E
5|$|In May 1982, the FAN {{started a}} final offensive, passing {{unhindered}} by the peacekeepers in Ati and Mongo. Goukouni, increasingly angered with the IAF's refusal to fight Habré, made {{an attempt to}} restore his relations with <b>Libya,</b> and reached Tripoli on 23 May. Gaddafi, however, burned by his experience the previous year, proclaimed <b>Libya</b> neutral in the civil war.|$|E

5|$|NATO and RAF E-3s {{participated in}} the {{international}} military operation in <b>Libya.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{military}} actions left Habré {{in control of}} Chad and {{in a position to}} threaten the expulsion of <b>Libya</b> from the Aouzou Strip, affected the international perception of <b>Libya</b> as a significant regional military power, and cast renewed doubt on the competence and determination of Libyan soldiers, especially in engagements beyond the country's borders to which they evidently felt no personal commitment.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 {{military}} intervention in <b>Libya,</b> the British Army extensively used Apaches from HMS Ocean. In 2013, U.S. 36th Combat Aviation Brigade AH-64Ds were tested {{on a variety of}} U.S. Navy ships.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, JANA, <b>Libya's</b> {{official}} news agency, reported that <b>Libya's</b> leader Muammar Gaddafi had persuaded Nouri {{to end the}} fighting. This was denied by a rebel spokesman.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Ettalhi became <b>Libya's</b> Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. In this capacity, {{he was the}} President of the United Nations Security Council in January 2008. He was <b>Libya's</b> Permanent Representative to the UN until January 2009.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s, <b>Libya's</b> {{government}} {{realized it}} could not meet the demands for skilled workers and post-secondary educators, and began reforms to help meet these demands. In 1988, then secretary of education Maatouq M. Maatouq helped establish the Ministry of Technical and Vocational training, which oversaw trade schools and secondary-level vocational programs. That year, Gadaffi also asked Dr. Saleh Ibrahim to create <b>Libya's</b> first postgraduate school, which by 2004 had trained 80 percent of <b>Libya's</b> post-secondary teaching staff.|$|R
5|$|Following the Games, she hid {{away from}} {{athletics}} following threats by militant group Al-Shabaab. She {{ended up in}} a Hizbul-Islam displacement camp, and in pursuit of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she crossed the border to Ethiopia looking for a safe place to train. She was trafficked north into <b>Libya,</b> where she was imprisoned. During the 2012 Games, it was revealed that Omar had drowned off the coast of <b>Libya</b> while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Gaddafi {{transformed}} <b>Libya</b> {{into a new}} socialist state {{called a}} Jamahiriya ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both {{the military and the}} Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing left it increasingly isolated on the international stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of <b>Libya</b> and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi rejected Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and Pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009–10. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern <b>Libya.</b> The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily {{on the side of the}} anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{collapse}} of Gaddafi's administration, Kenya immediately recognised the National Transitional Council as <b>Libya's</b> new government. <b>Libya's</b> embassy in Nairobi flew the NTC flag in September 2011. This occurred after a meeting in New York between Kenya's Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister of the NTC.|$|R
50|$|Bin Khayal was {{previously}} the first secretary at the Libyan embassy in Rome {{in the late}} 1960s. Bin Khayal served as <b>Libya's</b> First Secretary and Adviser for the Libyan Mission to the United Nations, New York at the UN Security Council during <b>Libya’s</b> 1976-1977 membership term. During his term at the UN he also worked in the capacity of Deputy Delegate with Mansour Rashid El-Kikhia. He was also <b>Libya’s</b> ambassador to Korea but resigned in 1984 after a gunman fired from the Libyan embassy in London at a protest outside, killing police officer Yvonne Fletcher.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 historians Brendan O'Carroll (New Zealand), Guno Goss (Switzerland) and Roberto Chiavetto (Italy) {{travelled}} to <b>Libya</b> {{to track}} down three LRDG trucks that had been abandoned in 1941 at Gebel Sherif, in Southern <b>Libya,</b> after the LRDG's first encounter with their Italian equivalent, the Autosahariana. This 65 minute documentary traced their journey, and includes never before seen archival film of the LRDG in action. It was first aired on ANZAC day, 25 April 2009 on Television New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Italian Harriers, {{operating}} from Giuseppe Garibaldi, worked alongside Italian Eurofighters and aircraft {{of other nations}} during Operation Unified Protector, part of the 2011 military intervention in <b>Libya.</b> They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over <b>Libya,</b> using the LITENING targeting pods while armed with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and AIM-9 Sidewinders. In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from Giuseppe Garibaldi dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.|$|E

Of <b>Libya's</b> total crude {{distillation}} capacity of 378,000 bpd, the country's five domestic refineries are refining 160,000 bpd of current production. <b>Libya's</b> largest refinery, Ra's Lanuf Refinery, is expected to remain offline {{until the end of}} the year.|$|R
5|$|Italy {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony of <b>Libya</b> was the Kingdom of Egypt. Although a neutral country, Egypt was occupied by the British {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the Suez Canal was threatened. A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between <b>Libya</b> and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.|$|E
5|$|<b>Libya</b> blocked access on January 24, 2010, {{because of}} videos that {{featured}} demonstrations {{in the city}} of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in <b>Libya.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Libya</b> {{had long}} {{supported}} the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad {{at the request}} of the FROLINAT-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so <b>Libya</b> sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's interference in their affairs; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic relations with <b>Libya,</b> while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the US and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union.|$|E

5|$|<b>Libya</b> {{was also}} {{expected}} to be an early export customer for twelve to fifteen Su-35s along with other Russian weapons; however, {{the civil war in}} <b>Libya</b> and the resulting military intervention cancelled such plans. Russia has also offered the modernized Su-35 to India, Malaysia, and Greece; no firm contracts have materialised, with the first two countries having been occupied with other fighter projects and unlikely to procure the modernized Su-35.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2011, {{military}} officials announced that Apaches would be deployed {{as part of}} Operation Ellamy, the ongoing military intervention in <b>Libya.</b> The helicopters operated from the flight deck of HMS Ocean in conjunction with French Eurocopter Tiger helicopters over Misrata. The Apaches were also to assist in Operation Unified Protector, the enforcement of an embargo and no-fly zone upon <b>Libya.</b> On 14 June 2011, reports of British preparation to evacuate Yemen emerged, involving Apache and Merlin helicopters operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels off the coast.|$|E

Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in <b>Libya</b> {{at the end}} of his presidency.|$|E
