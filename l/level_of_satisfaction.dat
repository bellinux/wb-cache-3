This was determined by the replication of a study conducted by the author 10 years ago at Marquette University. The present study examined the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> African-American students and was based on variables similar to those of the previous study. The study addressed the following research questions: (1) Are African-American students satisfied with the campus environment? (2) Do the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> differ between African-American female and male students? (3) Are the needs and concerns of African-American students being addressed and met on predominantly White campuses? (4) Do the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> differ among African-American students with regard to the number of years in attendance? and (5) Do the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> differ between EOP and non-EOP African-American students? An African-American student needs assessment survey which was comprised of three parts was given to 154 fulltime African-American students at Marquette University. Analysis of the data revealed the following: (1) African-American students in attendance at Marquette University were not satisfied with the campus environment; (2) no significant difference exist between male and female African-American students with regard to <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> except in the area of minority counseling and advising; (3) the needs and concerns of African-American student are not being adequately addressed; (4) no significant difference existed based on the number of years in attendance in college except in the area of African-American student involvement in programming of activities usually handled by the Student Government Association; and (5) significant differences exist between EOP and non-EOP African-American students in the areas of financial aid; African-American or racial minority-oriented extracurricular organizations; minority housing options; and facilities for African-American or minority recreational, cultural and social events...|$|R

A new indicator, a Likert scale asking floaters [...] "to rate their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the number of other boats they observed on the river", was also established to help identify [...] "solitude". New management efforts, such as outreach to reduce public expectations of solitude, incentives to reduce group size or the number of watercraft used by a group, and even closure of boat camps were contemplated. Limited restrictions were imposed on local landowners, however. The number outfitters was reduced from 16 to nine, after an FWP analysis showed that outfitters were trading permits and that only nine outfitters were actively engaged in floating the Smith.|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> nursing {{students}} with perioperative practical {{training and the}} factors influencing these levels, we conducted an anonymous self-questionnaire survey of 83 nursing students {{who had participated in}} perioperative practical training. The survey included questions about training situations, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the training, and evaluation of the training and teaching system. Analysis of the impacts of the perioperative practical training on the students’ learning showed that students who had observed the surgery through to completion showed significantly greater interest in operating room nursing, and that nurses’ guidance in open surgery was evaluated significantly more highly than their guidance in endoscopic surgery. Deepening of learning by observing surgery, receiving teachers’ guidance, and receiving guidance from nurses during surgery affected the students’ <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with perioperative practical training. 　To increase these <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> continuing surgical nursing education by teachers and nurses is needed. Before surgery, we need to improve students’ preparation for training by prior learning; during surgery, we need to tell students the progress of the ongoing surgery and the roles of nurses as needed. In addition, practical experience in nursing skills enables students to deepen their understanding of surgical nursing. These factors will increase the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> nursing students. 看護学生の手術室実習における実習満足度とその影響要因を明らかにすることを目的とし、手術室実習 を行った看護学生 83 名に無記名自記式質問紙調査を行った。調査内容は実習状況、実習満足度のほか、 実習および指導体制への評価とした。手術室実習が看護学生の学びに与える影響を分析した結果、実習 状況別では手術終了まで見学した学生は興味が有意に高く、切開手術群は鏡視下手術群に比して手術室 看護師の指導への評価が有意に高かった。手術室実習満足度には手術見学による学びの深まり、教員の 指導、手術中の看護師の指導が影響していることが明らかになった。 　手術室実習の満足度を高めるためには、教員と看護師による継続的な手術看護教育が求められる。術 前は事前学習により実習準備状態を高める工夫を行い、術中は手術の進行状況や看護師の役割を随時伝 えることや看護実践の経験により手術看護の理解を深めることが満足度の向上につながる...|$|R

Women working in traditional and non-traditional occupations (N = 52) in a mid-sized university in Western Canada participated in personal interviews.

No significant differences emerged when comparing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> women in non-traditional occupations with male reference groups and women in traditional occupations with female reference groups. Similarly, no significant differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> emerged between women in non-traditional occupations with female reference groups and women in traditional occupations with female reference groups. However, low power may have accounted for the non-significant findings. Other factors, such as job characteristics, that may be influencing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> job <b>satisfaction</b> are discussed. Content analysis of women’s definitions of career success suggested that women in each type of occupations used similar subjective criteria when defining career success, with the two most frequent coded criteria being “happy with work” and “achieving their goals”.
