500|$|At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, {{film critic}} Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Reservoir Dogs {{to that of the}} 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, whereby audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked {{the fact that he did}} not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said [...] "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> might suspect." [...] Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its [...] "deadpan sense of humor".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{complained about}} the game's low level of {{interactivity}} due {{to most of the}} gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu. Summarizing the gameplay in general as [...] "weak", GameSpot's Ricardo Torres argued that the game's promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by [...] "the gimmick of having to 'virtually' watch television programs" [...] and the long stretches of time this entails. Leeper claimed that Pikachu [...] "will be content much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> will" [...] and decried the channels' non-interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy went even further and claimed that there was [...] "no gameplay". He gave the game only one star out of five as a result, despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices [...] "decent". Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for Pokémon fan enjoyment, and gave the game a 3.0 on a five-point scale. Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall, with the exception of Pichu Bros, which she called [...] "the only worthwhile programming".|$|E

2500|$|Speculative {{economic}} bubbles are {{an obvious}} anomaly, {{in that the}} market often appears {{to be driven by}} buyers operating on escalating market sentiment/ [...] irrational exuberance, who take little notice of underlying value. These bubbles are typically followed by an overreaction of frantic selling, allowing shrewd investors to buy stocks at bargain prices. Rational investors have difficulty profiting by shorting irrational bubbles because, {{in the words of a}} famous saying attributed to John Maynard Keynes, [...] "Markets can stay irrational <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> can stay solvent." [...] Sudden market crashes as happened on Black Monday in 1987 are mysterious from the perspective of efficient markets, but allowed as a rare statistical event under the weak-form of EMH. Benoit Mandelbrot has argued that market bubbles are not anomalous but rather characteristic of price dynamics described by power laws such as Pareto, Zipf [...] or Tracy-Widom [...] combined with persistence in price change trends.|$|E
