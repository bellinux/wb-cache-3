40|$|Community {{assembly}} {{is driven}} by multiple factors, including resource availability and habitat requirements. <b>Litter</b> <b>nesting</b> ants respond to food and nest site availability, and adding food and nests may increase ant species richness and abundance. However, litter decomposers share food resources with ants, and increasing food availability may speed decomposition processes, eliminating twigs and seeds in which <b>litter</b> ants <b>nest.</b> We manipulated ant food and nest resources in three habitat types (forest, high-shade coffee, and low-shade coffee) to determine ant community responses after 1 and 2 mo. We examined changes in numbers of ant species, colonies, workers, brood, colony growth rate, and ant species composition. Habitat type strongly affected ant communities, influencing ant species richness, numbers of colonies and workers, and ant species composition. However, food addition and nest addition did not affect these community characteristics. Colony growth rate did not differ with food addition but was greater in forest and low-shade coffee compared with high-shade coffee. Habitat differences in colony growth may be because of presence of an aggressive species (Wasmannia auropunctata Roger) in high-shade coffee plots or naturally low arthropod densities {{during a time when}} ant colonization was low. Thus, in coffee landscapes, habitat type impacts <b>litter</b> <b>nesting</b> ant community structure, composition, and colony growth rate; however, food and nest addition had small impacts. © 2013 Entomological Society of America...|$|R

Callulina dawida, like other brevicipitids, deposit relatively small clutches of large yolk-rich eggs that are buffered by infertile jelly-filled egg capsules, possibly to prevent the fertile eggs from desiccation during the dry period. Eggs hatch at different times and the young ones immediately leave the nest site.

40|$|Growth rates, {{measures}} of ascarid burden, and {{the levels of}} anteroventral pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis at slaughter were determined for 352 hogs born between March 8 and March 28, 1987 on 15 farms located in Prince Edward Island. Regression analyses {{were used to determine}} associations between average daily gain (ADG) and independent variables controlling for sex, farm, and <b>litters</b> <b>nested</b> within farm. The regression model accounted for 75. 4 % of the variation in ADG. The number of intestinal ascarids at slaughter did not affect ADG. However, the "life-time burden" (a composite measure based on fecal egg counts and duration of infection) was associated with ADG (p less than 0. 05) in a quadratic manner. Although heavy ascarid burdens decreased the growth rate of swine, the magnitude of the effect was minimal. The maximum improvement one could expect from reducing the ascarid burden on heavily infected farms would be less than 1 %. Severe atrophic rhinitis and the presence of anteroventral pneumonia each had a detrimental effect on ADG (p less than 0. 001). The corresponding reductions in mean ADG were 7. 7 % and 2. 8 % respectively. There was significant interaction between the effects of atrophic rhinitis and anteroventral pneumonia on ADG (p less than 0. 05).

A quantitative {{sampling of the}} termite assemblages present on trunks and leaf <b>litter,</b> in <b>nests,</b> and in the soil was undertaken during the months of June and July (rainy season) and November and December (dry season) of 2000. Thirty seven species of termites were encountered and quantified in the three remnant forest areas. The termite biomass varied from 10. 09 to 11. 30 g (fresh weight) /m² {{and abundance}} varied from 4911 to 5663 individuals/m².

50|$|White stork nests are {{habitats}} for {{an array}} of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them.

A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being Macrocheles merdarius, M. robustulus, Uroobovella pyriformis and Trichouropoda orbicularis, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected.

Mice manipulated during postnatal development were more explorative and less anxious than unhandled mice, but this effect was not observable in the offspring of Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams. No effect of maternal Chlordiazepoxide was observed in unhandled offspring. The pharmacological treatment of the mother did not affect either pups' ultrasonic calling during separation, or maternal behavior far apart from the daily manipulation sessions. By contrast, Chlordiazepoxide-treated dams were less responsive toward pups upon reunion following daily separation. This alteration of dams' behavior was not related to alterations in the amount of ultrasonic calls emitted by pups during reunion. Finally, when dams were daily injected with Chlordiazepoxide far apart from pups' removal, the pharmacological treatment was devoid of effects. These results support the view that the mother-infant interaction which follows separation {{plays a major role in}} determining the effects of postnatal manipulations on adult emotionality...|$|R

Aspergillus spp. are often present in rotting plant material, including the <b>litter</b> and <b>nesting</b> material used for kiwi in captivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} survey nocturnal kiwi houses in New Zealand to assess the levels of Aspergillus currently present in leaf litter. Samples were received from 11 nocturnal kiwi houses from throughout New Zealand, with one site supplying multiple samples over time. Aspergillus was isolated and quantified by colony counts from litter samples using selective media and incubation temperatures. Isolates were identified to the species level by amplification and sequencing of ITS regions of the ribosomal. Aspergillus spp. were recovered from almost every sample; however, the levels in most kiwi houses were below 1000 colony-forming units (CFU) /g of wet material. The predominant species was Aspergillus fumigatus, with rare occurrences of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, and Aspergillus parasiticus. Only one site had no detectable Aspergillus. The limit of detection was around 50 CFU/g wet material. One site was repeatedly sampled as it had a high loading of A. fumigatus at the start of the survey and had two recent clinical cases of aspergillosis diagnosed in resident kiwi. Environmental loading at this site with Aspergillus spp. reduced but was not eliminated despite changes of the litter. The key finding of our study is that the background levels of Aspergillus spores in kiwi nocturnal houses in New Zealand are low, but occasional exceptions occur and are associated with the onset of aspergillosis in otherwise healthy birds. The predominant Aspergillus species present in the leaf litter was A. fumigatus, but other species were also present. Further research is needed to confirm the optimal management of leaf litter to minimize Aspergillus spore counts. However, in the interim, our recommendations are that leaf litter should be freshly collected from areas of undisturbed forest areas and spread immediately after collection, without interim storage. © American Association of Avian Pathologists...|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned {{conventional}} battery cages for {{laying hens}} throughout the European Union from January 1, 2012; they were banned previously {{in other countries}} including Switzerland. In response to these bans, development of prototype commercial furnished cage systems began in the 1980s. Furnished cages, sometimes called 'enriched' or 'modified' cages, are cages for egg laying hens which {{have been designed to}} overcome some of the welfare concerns of battery cages whilst retaining their economic and husbandry advantages, and also provide some of the welfare advantages of non-cage systems. Many design features of furnished cages have been incorporated because research in animal welfare science has shown them to be of benefit to the hens. In the UK, the Defra [...] "Code for the Welfare of Laying Hens" [...] states furnished cages should provide at least 750 cm2 of cage area per hen, 600 cm2 of which should be usable; the height of the cage other than that above the usable area should be at least 20 cm at every point and no cage should have a total area that is less than 2000 cm2. In addition, furnished cages should provide a <b>nest,</b> <b>litter</b> such that pecking and scratching are possible, appropriate perches allowing at least 15 cm per hen, a claw-shortening device, and a feed trough which may be used without restriction providing 12 cm per hen.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} decades, the {{population}} of the world has been increased to a greater number that is why different problems relating to food quality and food scarcity are the subject of discussion in the modern era. The main problem is to feed such a large population with a good quality food but many factors cause hindrance in achieving this task. There are many factors that lower the food quality and damage its nutritional potential. Among these factors mite pests are of immense importance which inhibat various environment including stored grains, stored products, cultivated mushroom, house dust, pollens, mosses, <b>litter</b> and <b>nest</b> of different animals. Mites (Acarina: Arachnida) are microscopic and widely distributed throughout the world. Mites' infestation decreases grains quality by changing the proportion of nutrients. Stored grain mites are also recognized as a source of allergens by inhalation in certain occupational environments and in the domestic environment. In order to check the species distribution from Punjab, identification is the key components to acquire better management. For this purpose various localities in different ecological zones including irrigated low land, semi-arid, sub humid eastern unirrigated and sub-mountain west were surveyed. For spot collection sieve method was used while the remaining samples had been processed through Berlese's funnel, the hypopi thus collected were mounted permanently on glass slides by using Hoyer's medium. In this present research work 24 species were collected. Among these 16 species are new to science and 8 species were already described of the genus Acotyledon Berlese viz. Acotyledon falki, tariqi, bellulus, stremma, haripuriensis, wazirabadensis, kamokiensis and peshawariensis. Among the new species 8 are belonging to Acotyledon Berlese, viz., cicero, multaniensis, Sarwari, haroonabadensis, augokiensis, veginus, tritici and chackwalensis; 4 species were belonging to the genus Caloglyphus Oudemans viz. pejowaliensis, sativum, jaranwalaensis and aurangensis; 1 species was belonging to genus Forcellinia Berlese viz. Chounawalaensis, 3 species was belonging to genus Histiostoma Kramer viz. mungus, balkasarensis and arshadi. Description, host range and distribution records of all these species are given in the following pages of this manuscript. Dendrograms of all the species from Pakistan in each genus are also prepared by using multivariate cluster analysis. The phenatic relationship of all known species from Pakistan has been worked out by cluster analysis using average linkage method and Euclidean distance by applying computer program Minitab...|$|R
