40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} changes in the cholesterol content in the milk of high yielding cows fed a uniform diet composed of conserved feeds over the whole year. The investigationswere conducted on 124 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows, selected fromherd yielding 8457 kg milk with 4, 58 % and 3, 56 % of fat and protein content, respectively. The cows were maintained in a <b>loose</b> <b>barn</b> and fed ad libitum with TMR (total mixed ration) throughout the year. The diets consisted of corn silage and grass silage (at 50 : 50 ration on dry matter basis) and concentrates with mineral-vitaminmixture additives. Samples of milk were collected individually from each cow at monthly intervals during the whole year. The cholesterol content in milk (mg/dL) and in milk fat (mg/g) was related to the stage of lactation, season of the year, somatic cell count and fat content, but was not affected by the parity. The cholesterol content in daily milk yield (mg/cow/day) depended also on parity. Even though the cows were fed a uniform diet throughout the year according to the TMR system the cholesterol content in milk differed among seasons...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the effect of separated manure as bedding material on milk quality as manifested in the somatic cell count. Cows were maintained in a <b>loose</b> <b>barn</b> in cubicles bedded with fresh separated cattle manure (SCM) with 40  % solids content. Analyses were conducted on 242 primiparous Polish Black and White Holstein-Friesian cows {{in the course of a}} 305 -day lactation. Mean milk yield in that period amounted to over 9000  kg per cow. Somatic cell counts, daily milk yields and chemical composition of milk were analysed. Data were obtained from analyses of 2324  milk samples. It was found that 93. 3  % of samples contained less than 400   000 somatic cells per 1  mL milk. Approximately 4. 3  % of milk samples contained the number of somatic cells indicating subclinical mastitis (200   000  cells mL − 1), while in 2. 4  % it was clinical mastitis (>  800   000 cells mL − 1). The incidence rate for both forms of mastitis was similar in the beginning and at the end of lactation. Mean daily milk yield of cows producing milk classified according to quality (SCC) grades 1 ( cells mL − 1) was statistically significantly greater than the yields of other cows. For analysed milk constituents a relationship was found between SCC classes and contents of milk fat and solids. Conducted analyses showed that SCM as bedding in cow cubicles had no effect on somatic cell counts in milk of primiparous cows.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} which elements that functioned in a positive way on the natural behaviors of dairy cattle among KRAV certificated and conventional farms. The study was based on reading of earlier research and completed by interviews with farmers, animal health inspectors and consumers. The results showed us that the KRAV certificated farms used only <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> and that the cattle were allowed a pasturetime of five months, or more, in one year. Our interviews with the consumers confirmed that KRAV was a well known trademark. The conventional farms were more flexible in their choice of housing systems, and used both <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> and barns with the cattle tethered. For those animals the pasturetime in one year were kept down to three to five months. During the interviews with the animal health inspectors it came to our knowledge that they valued elements as long pasturetime and <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> to support the natural behaviors of the animals. These factors also stood well in line with our own conclusions about what would function in a positive way on the natural behaviors of dairy cattle. This was confirmed not only by interviews but also by earlier research.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} {{of some of the}} problems of uncertainty associated with the selection of farm dairy building in eastern Nebraska. Farm buildings are the second largest and the most long lasting investment made by farmers. Since such structures are built only infrequently, a wide general knowledge of the economics of farm building does not develop at the farm level. When construction errors, usually costly, occur, farmers may have to live with their mistakes for a considerable time before correction is economically feasible. Although risk and uncertainty surround the decisions regarding all farm enterprises, few require the long-term amortization period that buildings do. Adoption of loose walk-thru housing has become commonplace among dairymen in eastern Nebraska. A survey by the University of Nebraska in January 1959 indicated that 37 percent had already adopted the <b>loose</b> housing <b>barn</b> and that by 1960 86 percent will use this type of building. This thesis is addressed to the problems associated with investing in a <b>loose</b> housing walk-thru <b>barn.</b> The analysis will be limited to consideration of the following objectives: 1. To ascertain to what extent building material affects annual cost of <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns.</b> 2. To determine the effect of fast amortization on annual costs. Advisor: Howard W.

Only 54 % of the 492 cows calving over a 12 month interval {{were observed in}} estrus at least once between parturition and day 55 postpartum. There was a significant genetic line by barn interaction in the detection of estrus mainly because more cows of the Ayrshire line were observed in estrus in the tie stall barn (75 %) compared to cows of the same line in the <b>loose</b> housing <b>barn</b> (48 %).

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to analyse {{problems}} with cold when working in dairyfarms with respect to prevalence, frequency and risk for injuries and to propose measures for improvements of thermal conditions. The project comprised two parts: a field study and a questionnaire survey. The field studies were performed at seven dairy-farms in the Uppsala region and six dairy-farms in the northern region of Sweden (Västerbotten). Four of the farms in the Uppsala region were non-insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns,</b> one was an insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barn</b> and two had traditional barns with tie stall. In Västerbotten, five of the farms were non-insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> and one was an insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barn.</b> In total, 20 farmers were studied during milking and animal feeding and maintenance. The majority of the studied farmers were owners of the farm and family members. During the field study, both physiological and physical measurements were performed. In addition, a detailed observation of the work, which enabled linking of measured data and the work tasks that were carried out. The physiological measurements included skin temperature of different body parts and heart rate. All subjects and their clothes were weighed before and after work in order to estimate sweating and evaporation. Further, the energetic workload was measured at the farms in Västerbotten. The physical measurements concerned air and surface temperature and air velocity in the buildings where work was performed as well as outdoors. A questionnaire was sent to 140 dairy-farms {{in the northern part of}} Sweden. The questions concerned problems and discomfort that may be related to cold, for example, how cold affected the work, problems with clothing, gloves and footwear. As was expected, the study showed that cold might cause considerable stress for dairy-farmers during cold weather. However, problems with cold should be viewed in a larger context. Workers in dairy-farms are exposed to several physical and physiological stressors in the work environment, such as moisture, organic dust, musculoskeletal stress and mental stress. During winter, cold adds to these stressors, which increases the environmental load on the individual. The typical climate in the raised milking parlours was as follows: low air temperature, which was lowest at foot level, high humidity, moisture, frequent draught and low surface temperatures. Hands and fingers often became cold during milking. The hands were often 20 - 25 °C. Especially the finger temperatures dropped to low levels during milking. In many cases it was below 16 °C for almost the whole spell of work. Finger temperatures down to 6 °C were observed at the end of the milking period in milking parlours with a non-insulated holding area, and 9 °C in milking parlours with an insulated holding area. In many cases, foot and toe temperatures dropped to unacceptably low levels. The reasons for cold feet were reported to be the result of inadequate footwear. This problem was probably related to the fact that rubber boots without an insulation layer were very common among the farmers. The second most common problem was sweaty or wet feet. An important way to be protected from cold is to use adequate clothing. Cotton, which absorbs moisture and water well, was a very common material in the garments worn by the farmers. For the outer layer of the clothing, a water-repellent material is a better alternative in cold-wet environments. At heavy work, which results in sweating, cotton is not the most appropriate material to wear close to the skin. Sweat is absorbed by the cotton and thus stays at the skin. This leads to discomfort and feels cold when heavy work changes to light work, or when the worker moves outdoors. Many commercial non-absorbing materials, which may contribute to better thermal comfort, are available. When using underwear made of such materials, the moisture is transported away from the skin to other clothing layers. Both the survey results and the observations indicated that cold was experienced as a minor problem in farms with non-insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> even though most of the participating farms were situated in one of the coldest regions of Sweden. In non-insulated <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns,</b> the work and the protection from cold is most likely adjusted to the cold climate, and temperature changes may lead to less discomfort, at least, for that reason. Greater experience of work in cold conditions probably contributes to a work organisation that minimises cold problems. In traditional barns, temperature changes between buildings and outdoors are common and were considered a major cause for thermal discomfort. Based on the results from this study, recommendations have been worked out. They provide a long list of interventions to prevent cold hands and feet, advice about clothing and other measures for improvements of the thermal conditions...|$|R

The metabolic status of the animals and milk production were also monitored. Immune responses, metabolite concentrations and milk production were not affected by treatment. The provision of an housing system close to natural conditions was able to improve the welfare of buffalo cows as indicated by the expression of some species-specific natural behaviours (i. e. grazing and wallowing) and the reduction of idling (P< 0. 001).

The foot skin temperatures were measured on dorsal foot and second toe. Most of the workers used rubber boots. The ambient temperature outdoors varied from + 5 to - 11 °C. Indoor temperatures could be the same as outdoors (cold barns and fodder storage) but also close to + 30 °C (milk room). The lowest mean foot and toe skin temperatures were 24. 1 ± 2. 6 °C and 16. 0 ± 1. 4 °C. The lowest measured values were 20. 1 °C and 12. 8 °C respectively. The toe temperatures were on average 7. 3 °C colder than foot temperatures (mean 28. 8 °C). The low foot skin temperature was well related to cold sensation.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to provide {{detailed}} herd level cost information about an outbreak of interdigital phlegmon (IP), which has been an emerging problem with enlarged <b>loose</b> house <b>barns</b> in Finland in recent years. During enlargement, the farmer’s financial situation is sensitive because of the large investments to the farm business and unexpected costs can risk the farm’s survival. Results The University of Helsinki research herd and three commercial herds having outbreaks of IP in 2012 or 2013 were visited to collect detailed information about the costs and economic impact of the outbreaks. The majority of the costs came from the discarded milk due to the antibiotic treatments. In Finland IP is usually treated with parental benzylpenicillin for 5  days which result in discarded milk for a total of 11  days. Third generation cephalosporins, widely used in other countries, have no milk withdrawal time. However, the use of these antibiotics is not recommended in Finland since these antimicrobials are critically important for human health. Herd-level costs varied between 4560 and 28, 386  € depending on the herd size, the frequency of the infected cows, the antibiotics used and other costs involved. The average cost per infected cow was 489  €. Conclusions The outbreaks of IP cause severe economic losses to dairy farms and the costs are lower if cows are treated with antibiotics with no withdrawal time. However, other costs, such as involuntary culling, reduced production and fertility also produce substantial costs to the farms. Early detection of sick animals, rapid treatment and control measures to limit the outbreak of IP can lower the costs. Because of the high costs farms should concentrate on preventing the disease...|$|R

This study aimed to find out the problems connected with feet during work in cold <b>loose</b> housing <b>barns</b> in winter time. 13 dairy farms were visited and 20 farm workers were measured. Skin temperatures and subjective responses were collected, and at the end of a work period the subjects filled in a questionnaire about the work day.

Indoor temperatures were the same as outdoors (cold barns and fodder storage) or close to 30 °C (milk room). The lowest measured foot and toe skin temperatures over the whole work period were 24. 102. 6 °C and 16. 001. 4 °C. The lowest measured values were 20. 1 °C and 12. 8 °C respectively.

40|$|Little {{information}} is available concerning the effects of offering additional concentrates with total mixed ration (TMR) on milk production. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare TMR representing simplified feeding (TMR 1) with TMR combined with a decreasing amount of additional concentrate (TMR 2 C). Finnish Ayrshire cows (39) were housed in a <b>loose</b> housing <b>barn.</b> TMR 1 consisted of a mixed ration of grass silage (0. 49) and concentrates (0. 51). In TMR 2 C, the same grass silage and concentrate were mixed in a ratio of 55 : 45. In TMR 2 C, cows were offered additional concentrates from automatic feeders differing in composition from the concentrate in TMR 1 [6. 5 kg d- 1 (first 100 days, Phase 1), 3. 0 kg d- 1 (subsequent 50 days, Phase 2) and no concentrate thereafter (Phase 3) ]. During the whole experiment (224 days), total consumption of concentrates per cow averaged 2426 kg dry matter (TMR 1) and 2414 kg dry matter (TMR 2 C). There were no significant differences in mean total dry matter, metabolizable energy, crude protein or absorbed amino acid intakes. During Phase 2, total intake of all cows fed TMR 2 C was one kg lower (P = 0. 10) than for cows fed TMR 1. This was due to differences in total feed intake of multiparous cows. Average yields (kg d- 1) of milk, energy corrected milk, protein, fat and lactose were not significantly different between diets. During Phase 2, primiparous cows tended to produce more energy corrected milk on TMR 2 C than on TMR 1. The results showed that both TMR 1 and TMR 2 C were equal feeding strategies for early lactating cows and cows did not benefit from greater concentrate consumption in early stage of lactation when total consumption of concentrates was similar. ...|$|R

Treatment did not affect daily milk yield and milk fat, protein or somatic cell count content. Blood metabolite levels were not affected by treatment and interaction treatment x time. Conversely, as expected, calving distance had an influence on most of these variables (P particular, in the first two months after parturition, glucose concentration decreased, whereas NEFA and cholesterol increased as a consequence of the high energetic requirements of animals in the first stage of lactation.

40|$|The {{main housing}} options for dairy cows and their {{replacements}} are freestall barns, tie stall <b>barns,</b> <b>loose</b> housing or bedded-pack barns, outside corrals or feedlots, and pasture. Housing facilities for young stock {{should include a}} clean, dry maternity area for birth, a hutch or pen, and a weaning pen or super hutch which can hold 3 - 5 calves. A proper ventilation system is necessary in the barns to continuously exchange air. A proper manure handling and storage system must be coordinated with cow numbers, cropland acres, crop nutrient needs, and weather. Cornell undertook {{a survey of the}} diary industry in New York in 1997. New York state dairy producers, for the most part, managed their milking herds in stanchion barns with access to pastures.

Animals were subjected to six sessions of instantaneous scan sampling at 10 -day intervals. Behavioural variables were expressed as proportions of subjects observed in each category of posture and activity. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was used to perform a skin test based on non-specific delayed type hypersensitivity, whereas 20 mg of ovalbumin were injected subcutaneously to evaluate humoral immune response. Blood samples for evaluation of cortisol concentration were collected immediately prior to exogenous porcine ACTH injection and 1, 2 and 4 h after. The metabolic status of the animals and milk production were also monitored. The proportion of idling animals was higher in group IS than in group TS (P< 0 · 001). More IS buffalo cows were observed eating at the manger than TS animals (P< 0 · 001). A higher proportion of TS animals were observed in the sun (P< 0 · 001). Grazing and bathing activities were recorded only for TS animals. Our findings suggest that buffalo cows kept in intensive conditions and having no access to ample yards and potholes may extend their periods of idling with negative effects on the state of welfare. Immune responses, metabolite concentrations and milk production were not affected by treatment, whereas cortisol levels were higher in IS animals (P< 0 · 05).

40|$|The {{ability of}} dairy cows {{to survive and}} the {{economic}} importance of this have been in-creasing in dairy cattle breeding lately. Increased longevity contribute to an increased pro-portion of cows that produce milk in more productive lactations and reduces the replace-ment costs together with a good health and fertility. Unfortunately it is often argued that longevity has been decreasing due to a strong selection for production traits in dairy cattle. The aims {{of this study were}} to find correlations between different longevity evaluations and between different estimates on longevity and other traits in the Nordic Total Merit (NTM) breeding value. The aim was also to compare different traits for cows of two differ-ent longevity groups. The data were Predicted Breeding Values (PBV) from Nordic HOL and SR bulls and records from Holstein (HOL) and Swedish Red (SR) cows estimated by the Swedish Dairy Association. The three Swedish longevity indexes were very highly correlated (> 0. 89) and the corre-lations between the Swedish official longevity index and the five Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation (NAV) longevity indexes varied between 0. 73 - 0. 83. In the sire evaluation part, the traits most negatively correlated with longevity for HOL were dairyness, protein and fat index. In SR, milk, protein, and fat index only had slightly positive correlations with longevity. The traits most strongly positively correlated with longevity for SR were different fertility traits, udder health, leg and hoof treatments and other diseases. These traits also had high positive correlations to longevity for HOL togeth-er with metabolic treatments and different calving and udder traits. Some traits were found to have intermediate optima in the correlation to longevity and the correlations have also been varying during the past 20 years. It was also found that the Swedish official longevity index has been increasing during these 20 years. In the cow record part all production traits in first lactation were significant positive re-lated to longevity together with udder traits, milking speed and temperament. They should also have posty and parallel legs with a steep foot angle and a fine bone and hock quality. A HOL cow should be shorter, shallower and narrower and have a strong top line, low pins and a coarse dairyness. SR should instead be deeper and more angular. Fertility problems were the most common culling reasons for first lactation cows and udder health traits were the most common culling reason for older cows. Herds decreasing in size had a higher amount of cows that were culled after one lactation than stable or increasing herds.
