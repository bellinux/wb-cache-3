The drafters of the existing space law treaties did not foresee changes in the private ownership of satellites in orbit. This can cause problems if a privately owned satellite is transferred to a new owner located in a state different from the <b>launching</b> <b>state.</b> In such a case the registration and oversight responsibilities {{as well as the}} potential liability for damage of the original <b>launching</b> <b>state</b> or states under the OST or the other space treaties continue even though the original <b>launching</b> <b>state</b> is no longer the state appropriate to supervise the satellite.|$|E

40|$|First three paragraphs: It is {{probably}} difficult to overstate {{the importance of}} liability and the related area of insurance when domestic legislation {{in the field of}} space activities is concerned, as such activities still constitute a relatively hazardous undertaking and the risks of something going horribly wrong are always close at hand. Moreover, though fortunately so far major accidents as a consequence of space activities—at least on earth—have not occurred, if they would occur there should be little doubt that they may cause major damage, potentially even of a catastrophic size. As a consequence, the question as regards who would be liable to pay for such damage, and as a follow-up whether and to what extent insurance might (have to) cover such liability compensation, is indeed of great importance. In the context of national authorisation specifically, the issue of liability is framed by the general framework developed at the international level by means, principally, of Article VII of the Outer Space Treaty 1 and the Liability Convention. 2 The starting point in this respect is the principled allocation of liability for damage caused by a space object to the “launching State” or “launching States” of that space object. Article II of the Liability Convention provides in this respect: “A <b>launching</b> <b>State</b> shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object {{on the surface of the}} Earth or to aircraft in flight,” 3 whereas Article III along the same lines provides: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one <b>launching</b> <b>State</b> or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another <b>launching</b> <b>State,</b> the latter shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible. ”...|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{satellite}} Cosmos 954 {{was launched}} by the Soviet Union in September 1977. Due to some difficulties in functioning, Cosmos 954 made an unscheduled return to earth and its debris scattered over {{a large portion of}} Canadian territory on January 24, 1978. The Canadian government, informed that the satellite had radioactive material on board, immediately began urgent operations to reduce the actual damage and to return the territory affected to its normal condition. Considering that the costs incurred during the operations should be claimed from the Soviet Union, the Government of Canada prepared a claim based in particular on the Convention on International Liability for Damage caused by space objects. The claim was presented to the Soviet representative on January 23, 1979. The Canadian government alleged that Canada sustained damage from the return on earth of the Cosmos 954 satellite. The Soviet Union, as the <b>launching</b> <b>State,</b> is absolutely responsible and should pay an appropriate amount of compensation. The amount claimed is slightly over 6 million dollars. Canada, subsequent to the incident, has proposed to the United Nations the adoption of a new regime for the use of nuclear energy in outer space...|$|E

40|$|Small payload launch {{opportunities}} {{have been}} difficult to arrange within the United States, driving many small payload owners to foreign launch services as their best option. This is {{in spite of the fact}} that each year in the United States thousands of pounds of excess capacity to orbit goes unused. There are several reasons for this that this paper will address, along with a review of potential options for improving the situation. In addition to these secondary rideshare opportunities, there are several emerging small launch vehicle offerings that will be capable of providing dedicated space access for small payloads; these U. S. systems and their associated development status will also be discussed herein. Even if the U. S. small payload launch opportunities could be made completely accessible, there would still likely be more small payloads seeking a launch than the available capacity could satisfy. Various categories of small payloads will be postulated and the issues and options for acquiring secondary launch opportunities will be discussed. Safety, integration, and mission assurance implications and options will be discussed in the context of establishing criteria and guidelines acceptable to the launch services providers, launch service acquirers, and prime satellite owners. The third topic of this paper is the operational implications of a proliferation of small satellites on space track capabilities and space debris in general. The perception of these concerns could impact the ability to acquire a launch opportunity, where any damage due to collisions have liability implications for the <b>launching</b> <b>state</b> and the ability to keep an accurate track of small objects in space complicates this matter. This paper will draw upon the significant insight and ongoing engagement of the launch community by the authors. In addition, the three described topics will be further addressed through the findings and recommendations produced by working sessions at the 2015 Small Payload Rideshare Symposium held in June. This paper is intended to frame these three important topics and stimulate an informed discussion among the small payload rideshare community and the various government agencies responsible for space policy, launch services, and on-orbit support operations leading to an increase in viable opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Launch {{activities}} are increasingly performed by private entities and launch participants {{deal with a}} complex legal environment. The Space Treaties provide a framework placing liability for non-governmental activities on the <b>launching</b> <b>State</b> and the duty to authorize and supervise them on the appropriate State. Launch participants are subject to specific regulation in certain States or are under institutional State control in others. They also have to comply with general domestic law of liability. Limited insurance availability {{led to the development}} of contractual risk allocation techniques, the inter-participants waivers of liability and claims, inspired by NASA practice. This thesis offers a contribution with the synthesis of information, so far scattered, on today's legal environment, providing an overview of the norms at play in this field to allow the grasp of their relative weight and interactions in the assessment of liability risk attached to launch activities. This synthesis reveals a legal framework presently lacking the predictability necessary for an efficient liability risk management: (1) inter-participants waivers of liability suffer the weaknesses of all limitation of liability clauses; they also lack uniformity and implementation rigor; (2) the Space Treaties contain ambiguous terms preventing predictable determination of the State liable for damage and the State obliged to authorize and supervise launch activities, and do not reflect the de facto primary liability of launch operators. This thesis offers a contribution to the advancement of legal work on these problems by suggesting new approaches emphasizing the need for: (1) harmonization of inter-participants waivers of liability to improve their consistency and validity and ensure identical flow-down by all participants; (2) improvements of the Outer Space Treaty, Liability Convention and Registration Convention for their implementation to non-governmental launch activities. Although the launch community is small and the need for lawmaking is not as compelling as in fields such as aviation. Nevertheless, tailored adjustments to the present legal framework are required and proposed in this thesis through model clauses and an international instrument, both of which are submitted for further thinking and contribution by those sharing the opinion that creative lawmaking is now necessary to prepare for tomorrow's endeavors...|$|E
