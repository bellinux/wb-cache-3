It summarizes {{the most important}} theoretical and practical findings about mountain <b>lee</b> <b>waves,</b> available in both Czech and foreign resources. It also discusses another phenomena and types of air flow related to the air layer's flow over a barrier. In a special chapter there is an introduction into the use of mountain <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> for gliding. Another part of the thesis analyzes in detail Czech areas, where the <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> can occur, {{and there are also}} mentioned the conditions of their occurence in those areas. Jeseníky mountains by southwest winds are the most sought after area, because it's possible to achieve a long distance and significant elevation difference when gliding there, in addition to ability of flying in levels normally restricted. The last part of the thesis discusses the possibilities of <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> forecasting, with a demonstration on a specific model, linked by a data record of a flight. Currently, the main wave-forecasting instrument is the numerical model WRF, which predicted rising areas in the considerated case correctly, regardless the horizontal resolution 1 or 2 km.

30|$|The InSAR {{technique}} observes {{water vapor}} heterogeneity over land because the interferometry requires unchanged scattering characteristics {{at the surface}} target. This means that InSAR cannot observe over water body areas like lakes and oceans, {{which is one of}} the disadvantages of the InSAR observation. On the contrary, the sea surface wind-retrieval technique by the use of SAR SLC data can retrieve footprints of trapped <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> that extend toward near the sea surface (e.g., Miglietta et al. 2013). This technique complements unobservable areas of InSAR. Using both InSAR and the SAR wind-retrieval techniques enables us to capture the wide range of trapped <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> with no other observations. To our knowledge, there have been no studies that used these two techniques in combination to derive the spatial distribution of trapped <b>lee</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R

30|$|Atmospheric {{mountain}} <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> {{excited by}} a strong westerly wind ahead of approaching cold front are shown to have significant effect on GPS positioning. Before {{the approach of the}} cold front significant atmospheric gradients caused by the inhomogeneous water vapor are detected at the sites along the east coast of the Izu Peninsula because of a wet atmosphere to the west of these sites. In contrast, the island site 6 km east of the coast detects a strong gradient with the opposite sense.

50|$|Copley {{has its own}} {{official}} {{weather station}} run by the Met Office and Environment Agency. Because of its height above sea-level, around the 1,000 ft contour, and position in the north-east, this station is often one of the coldest in England with high incidences of ground frosts and snowfalls. Copley's situation in north-east England also places it in a relatively dry and sunny rain-shadow area in {{the shelter of the}} higher Pennines to the west. However, the higher Pennines can also create a local strong and gusty effect if the wind blows from the west-south-west. This is called the Pennine <b>Lee</b> <b>Wave</b> and can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly.|$|E
40|$|The drag {{produced}} by 2 D orographic gravity waves trapped at a temperature inversion and waves propagating in the stably stratified layer existing above are explicitly calculated using linear theory, for a two-layer atmosphere with {{neutral static stability}} near the surface, mimicking a well-mixed boundary layer. For realistic values of the flow parameters, trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag, which is given by a closed analytical expression, is comparable to propagating wave drag, especially in moderately to strongly non-hydrostatic conditions. In resonant flow, both drag components substantially exceed the single-layer hydrostatic drag estimate used in most parametrization schemes. Both drag components are optimally amplified for a relatively low-level inversion and Froude numbers Fr ≈ 1. While propagating wave drag is maximized for approximately hydrostatic flow, trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag is maximized for l_ 2 a = O(1) (where l_ 2 is the Scorer parameter in the stable layer and a is the mountain width). This roughly happens when the horizontal scale of trapped lee waves matches that of the mountain slope. The drag behavior {{as a function of}} Fr for l_ 2 H = 0. 5 (where H is the inversion height) and different values of l 2 a shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Regions of parameter space with high trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag correlate reasonably well with those where <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> rotors were found to occur in previous nonlinear numerical simulations including frictional effects. This suggests that trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag, besides giving a relevant contribution to low-level drag exerted on the atmosphere, may also be useful to diagnose lee rotor formation...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{show that}} as uniformly stratified fluid flows over a smoothly-varying step, two wave-like phenomena result: boundary-trapped <b>lee</b> <b>waves,</b> {{characterized by an}} undular shear layer downstream of {{the base of the}} step, and internal waves, which propagate vertically away from the step. The frequency of both types of waves is an approximately constant fraction of the buoyancy frequency. The frequency of internal waves is moderately smaller than <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> if the step size is small but, if the step size is large, the frequencies match more closely. Thus nonlinear dynamics act so that internal waves are generated not by topography alone but also by flow over the boundary-trapped <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> that act as "fluidic" hills. This new mechanism for internal wave generation may be an important factor in mixing over rough topography in the ocean.

40|$|Observations and {{modeling}} simulations are presented that illustrate {{the importance of}} a density contrast and the upstream response to the time dependence of stratified flow over the Knight Inlet sill. Repeated sections of velocity and density show that the flow during ebb and flood tides is quite different: a large <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> develops early in flood tide, whereas lee-wave growth is suppressed until the second half of ebb tide. There is a large upstream response that displaces as much water as accumulates in the <b>lee</b> <b>wave,</b> one that is large enough to also block the flow at a depth roughly consistent with simple dynamics. There is a large density contrast between the seaward and landward sides of the sill, and a ‘‘salty pool’ ’ of water is found in the seaward basin that is not found landward. The interface with this salty pool demarks the point of flow separation during ebb, initially suppressing the <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> and then acting as its lower boundary. A simple two-dimensional numerical model of the inlet was used to explore the important factors governing the flow. A base simulation that included the landward–seaward asymmetry of the sill shape, but not the density difference, yielded a response that was almost symmetric with a large <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> forming early during both flood and ebb tide. The simulation behaves more like the observations when a salty pool of water is added seaward of the sill. This salty pool induces flow separation in the model and suppresses growth of the <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> until late in ebb. This effect is termed ‘‘density-forced’ ’ flow separation, a modification of ‘‘postwave’ ’ flow separation that allows for a density gradient across an obstacle. 1...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{drag force}} {{produced}} by trapped lee waves and upward propagating waves in non-hydrostatic stratified flow over a mountain ridge is explicitly calculated using linear theory for a two-layer atmosphere with piecewise-constant static stability and wind speed profiles. The behaviour of the drag normalized by its hydrostatic single-layer reference value is investigated {{as a function}} of the ratio of the Scorer parameters in the two layers l_ 2 /l_ 1 and of the corresponding dimensionless interface height l_ 1 H, for selected values of the dimensionless ridge width l_ 1 a and ratio of wind speeds in the two layers. When l_ 2 /l_ 1 → 1, the propagating wave drag approaches 1 in approximately hydrostatic conditions, and the trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag vanishes. As l_ 2 /l_ 1 decreases, the propagating wave drag progressively displays an oscillatory behaviour with l_ 1 H, with maxima of increasing magnitude due to constructive interference of reflected waves in the lower layer. The trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag shows localized maxima associated with each resonant trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> mode, occurring for small l_ 2 /l_ 1 and slightly higher values of l_ 1 H than the propagating wave drag maxima. As l 1 a decreases, i. e. the flow becomes more non-hydrostatic, the propagating wave drag decreases and the regions of non-zero trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag extend to higher l_ 2 /l_ 1. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations for l_ 2 /l_ 1 = 0. 2. In parameter ranges of meteorological relevance, the trapped <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> drag may have a magnitude comparable to that of propagating wave drag, and be larger than the reference single-layer drag. This may have implications for drag parametrization in global climate and weather-prediction models...|$|E
40|$|A global {{estimate}} of the energy conversion rate from geostrophic flows into internal <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> in the ocean is presented.

The total energy flux into internal <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> is estimated to be 0. 2 TW which is 20 % of the global wind power input into the ocean. The geographical distribution of the energy flux is largest in the Southern Ocean which accounts for half of the total energy flux.

Observations indicate that the <b>lee</b> <b>waves</b> attained a maximum vertical velocity of more than 9 m s¡ 1, potential-temperature perturbations greater than 10 K, and a horizontal wavelength of approximately 12 – 15 km.

40|$|The rate of {{generation}} of internal gravity {{waves in the}} lee of small length scale topography by geostrophic flow in the World Ocean was estimated using linear theory with corrections for finite amplitude topography. Several global data sets were combined for the calculation including an ocean circulation model for the near-bottom geostrophic flow statistics, over 500 abyssal current meter records, historical climatological data for the buoyancy frequency, and two independent estimates of the small scale topographic statistical properties. The first topography estimate was based on an empirically-derived relationship between paleo-spreading rates and abyssal hill roughness, with corrections for sedimentation. The second estimate was based on small-scale (< 100 km) roughness of satellite altimetry-derived gravity field, using upward continuation relationships to derive estimates of abyssal hill roughness at the seafloor at scales less than approximately 20 km. The <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> generation rate was found to be between 0. 34 to 0. 49 TW. The Southern Hemisphere produced 92 % of the <b>lee</b> <b>wave</b> energy, with the Southern Ocean dominating.
