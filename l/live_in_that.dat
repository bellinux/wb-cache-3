In addition, there are about 350 security cameras constantly monitoring every residence hall and the doors are always locked.

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

The anglicised forms wha, wham, whase 'who, whom, whose', and the older whilk 'which' are literary affectations; whilk is only used after a statement He said he'd tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear (he said he'd lost it, which {{is not what we}} wanted to hear". The possessive is formed by adding s or by using an appropriate pronoun The wifie that's hoose gat burnt (the woman whose house was burnt), the wumman that her dochter gat mairit (the woman whose daughter got married); the men that thair boat wis tint (the men whose boat was lost).|$|E
500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear me play.

500|$|In 2011 South African {{politician}} Julius Malema {{was found}} guilty of hate speech in the High Court in Johannesburg for repeatedly singing the anti-apartheid protest song [...] "Shoot the Boer" [...] at political gatherings. Civil rights organisation AfriForum accused Malema of inciting violence against white South Africans, citing the ongoing spate of farm attacks (the literal meaning of Boer is [...] "farmer"). Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was [...] "derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful" [...] to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said [...] "People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> society with them." ...|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E
500|$|The {{land that}} Van Cortlandt Park now {{occupies}} {{was acquired by}} Van Cortlandt from Philipse in the mid-to-late 1690s. In 1699, Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook in order to power a sawmill (and later, a gristmill), creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process. In 1732, Van Cortlandt acquired an additional parcel from the Tippett family. The estate was then passed on to Jacobus's son Frederick Van Cortlandt (1699–1749) and family in 1739; it was once a vast grain plantation. [...] In 1748, Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the former Tippett property, but died before its completion. The Van Cortlandts did not primarily <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> house, instead staying in Manhattan most of the time. [...] A family burial ground was created in 1749, later {{to be known as}} [...] "Vault Hill." [...] Frederick, who was buried in Vault Hill, [...] had willed the massive home and surrounding lands to his son, James Van Cortlandt (1727–1787).|$|E

500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E
