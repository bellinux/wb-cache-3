40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> of {{depressive}} adolescents and compare them with non-clinical adolescents’ <b>life</b> <b>stories.</b> Methods: For this purpose, we compared 20 <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> of hospitalized adolescents suffering from major depressive episode with 40 <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> of adolescents attending school divided into two groups: 20 non-depressed and 20 depressed adolescents. Results: Results showed that <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> differed as a function of psychopathology. Depressed hospitalized adolescents spoke about their disease and defined themselves by their depression. The depressed adolescents in school concentrated on schooling and school achievements, while the non-depressed group defined themselves by their family, friends and inclusion in a peer group. Conclusion: These analyses allowed us to highlight specific themes mentioned by each of the three groups of adolescents. Although <b>life</b> <b>stories</b> are personal and unique, analysis of such stories allows us to better understand the daily reality of depressive adolescents and the relationships between the life events they experience, daily stressors, depression and how they construct their personal history...|$|R
