The paper can itself be shaped to create the desired effects in the final image. Many of László Moholy-Nagy's photograms were luminograms. The image is created by variations in <b>light</b> <b>shape</b> and intensity. They can be created using a small light source, as from a flashlight, that is moved to expose the photosensitive substrate.

The player makes their way up the hill to the top-most observatory and upon entering sees the human <b>light</b> <b>shape</b> of Kate inside in the darkness making the last of the recordings heard throughout the game. She states that she is the last one left, and it is revealed that she did indeed finally achieve communication with 'the pattern'. Kate explains that when she told the pattern that what it did to everyone in the valley - the people, the birds, the bugs, the cows - was wrong, it countered that it was not wrong, because now everyone that wanted to be together was together, and that everyone had found their counterpart and was no longer alone. Kate explains how she finally understands and says that she has accepted her fate, and that she and 'the pattern' will soon join the others. She states that humanity can finally 'slip away, unafraid.' Kate turns and appears to reach out to the pattern coming down from above as it reaches out to meet her, her last words being her belief that the Pattern was her own counterpart.|$|E

40|$|A Photometric Image-Based Rendering (PIBR) con-cept is {{proposed}} that facilitates {{the generation of}} an image with an arbitrary illumination. Based on this concept, we aim to generate both diffuse and specular reflections. It {{is not necessary to}} explicitly recover 3 D shape and reflection properties of the scene. In order to control appearance changes caused by modifications in the lighting conditions, we utilize a set of real images taken in a variety of lighting conditions. Since the dif-fuse and specular reflection components have different characteristics, we separate these components and ap-ply different methods to each. A photometric lineariza-tion is introduced to control diffuse reflections as well as for separating the other components. This also fa-cilitates the treatment of attached shadows {{as a part of the}} diffuse reflection. A morphing technique is utilized to generate specular reflections. This is an effective technique for dealing with glossy objects, even when the <b>light</b> <b>shape</b> is clearly observed in the specular reflection. Experimental results show that realistic images can be successfully generated using this technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|Human {{observers}} {{are able to}} successfully infer direction and intensity of light from photographed scenes despite complex interactions between <b>light,</b> <b>shape,</b> and material. We investigate how well {{they are able to}} distinguish other low-level aspects of illumination, such as the diffuseness and the number of light sources. We use photographs of a teapot, an orange, and a tennis ball from the ALOI database (Geusebroek, Burghouts, & Smeulders, 2005) to create different illumination conditions, varying either in diffuseness of a single light source or in separation angle between two distinct light sources. Our observers were presented with all three objects; they indicated which object was illuminated differently from the other two. We record discrimination performance, reaction times, and eye fixations. We compare the data to a model that uses differences in image structure in same-object comparisons, and outcomes suggest that participants mostly rely on the information contained in cast shadows and highlights. The pattern of eye fixations confirms this, showing that after the first fixation, observers mostly fixate cast shadow areas. However, information in the highlights is rather salient, so it might be available from first fixation, making separate fixations are unnecessary. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a 99 g finger joint that can exert {{a very strong}} fingertip force of more than 100 N. We have shown that a simple five-bar linkage {{can be used as}} a load-sensitive continuously variable transmission (CVT) for a finger joint. The maximum fingertip force of our previous finger was limited by the mechanical strength of its links and bearings, not by the power of its DC motor. If the machine strength can be improved, a much greater fingertip force can be expected. To design a lightweight CVT with sufficient mechanical strength, we analyze the internal force of the CVT and select light plain bearings. We also analyze the stress by using the finite element method and select the materials of its links. Experimental results verify that the maximum fingertip force is more than 100 N near the singular configuration of the CVT and the maximum angular velocity is more than 550 deg/s. These motions are impossible without the CVT. We also developed a very <b>light</b> <b>shape</b> memory alloy brake of 0. 56 g. The CVT with the brake can hold a fingertip force of more than 100 N not only near the singular configuration. The electric energy consumed by the brake is much less than that by the DC motor.

40|$|Lighting is a {{fundamental}} aspect of computer cinematography that involves the placement and configuration of lights to establish mood and enhance storytelling. This process is labor intensive as artists repeatedly adjust the parameters of a large set of complex lights to achieve a desired effect. Typical lighting controls affect the final image indirectly, requiring {{a large number of}} trials to obtain a suitable result. We present an interactive system wherein an artist paints desired lighting effects directly into the scene, and the computer solves for parameters that achieve the desired look. The artist can paint color, <b>light</b> <b>shape,</b> shadows, highlights, and reflections using a suite of tools designed for painting light. Our system matches these effects using a nonlinear optimizer made robust by a combination of initial estimates, system design, and user-guided optimization. In contrast, previous work on painting light has not permitted the lights to move, allowing for linear optimization but preventing its use in computer cinematography. To demonstrate our approach we lit several scenes, mainly using a direct illumination renderer designed for computer animation, but also including two other rendering styles. We show that painting interfaces can quickly produce high quality lighting setups, easing the lighting artist’s workflow...|$|E
40|$|Measuring the {{integrated}} stellar halo light around galaxies is very challenging. The surface brightness of these haloes {{are expected to}} be many magnitudes below dark sky and the central brightness of the galaxy. Here I show that in some of the recent literature the effect of very extended Point Spread Function (PSF) tails on the measurements of halo light has been underestimated; {{especially in the case of}} edge-on disc galaxies. The detection of a halo along the minor axis of an edge-on galaxy in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field can largely be explained by scattered galaxy light. Similarly, depending on filter and the shape one assumes for the uncertain extended PSF, 20 to 80 per cent of the halo light found along the minor axis of scaled and stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) edge-on galaxy images can be explained by scattered galaxy light. Scattered light also significantly contributes to the anomalous halo colours of stacked SDSS images. The scattered light fraction decreases when looking in the quadrants away from the minor axis. The remaining excess light is well modelled with a Sersic profile halo with shape parameters based on star count halo detections of nearby galaxies. Even though the contribution from PSF scattered light does not fully remove the need for extended components around these edge-on galaxies, it will be very challenging to make accurate halo <b>light</b> <b>shape</b> and colour measurements from integrated light without very careful PSF measurements and scattered light modelling.
