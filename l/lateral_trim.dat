50|$|It is {{not safe}} {{practice}} to drain one cylinder, retaining the entire reserve in the other, {{in case of}} a catastrophic failure of the second cylinder supply. Sidemount divers are trained to maintain a roughly equal balance of gas supply in each primary cylinder throughout the dive. This ensures that they always retain an equal reserve of gas for donation to an out-of-gas diver; and also helps preserves their stability and <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> by maintaining equal buoyancy characteristics in the tanks on either side of their body.|$|E
40|$|Oblique wing {{aeroelasticity}} {{studies are}} reviewed. The static aeroelastic stability characteristics of oblique wing aircraft, <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> requirements for 1 -g flight, and the dynamic aeroelastic stability behavior of oblique winged aircraft, primarily flutter, {{are among the}} topics studied. The {{similarities and differences between}} oblique winged aircraft and conventional, bilaterally symmetric, swept wing aircraft are emphasized...|$|E

Air Forces' {{accelerated}} transonic flight tests of the XS- 1 No. 1 airplane for the Mach number range from 0. 70 to 1. 25 at altitudes from 30, 000 to 49, 000 feet. Data are included on horizontal-tail loads and buffeting, longitudinal trim changes, elevator effectiveness and control forces, and <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a recent investigation of the static aerodynamic and stability characteristics of a two-surface advanced turboprop aircraft. The conceptual design places Hamilton Standard SR- 7 turboprop blades close to the horizontal and vertical tail for potential acoustic shielding. Evaluation of the data shows generally favorable effects of power on aircraft stability and control, and that <b>lateral</b> directional <b>trim</b> can be achieved with one engine inoperative. The tests did show a marked effect of the direction of propeller rotation on thrust minus drag performance...|$|R
50|$|The P.120 {{followed}} the earlier Boulton Paul P.111 delta-wing experimental aircraft. It was produced for the Air Ministry to specification E.27/49 and {{differed from the}} P.111 in having a swept fin and rudder with horizontal tail surfaces high on the fin to improve longitudinal and directional stability. It had essentially the same wing as the P.111 in the latter's greatest span configuration, an unclipped delta; the wing tips of the P.120 were not removable or replaceable, but they could be rotated differentially or together for <b>lateral</b> or longitudinal <b>trim.</b> Just inboard of these tips the P.120 gained a pair of wingfences. The fuselages of the two aircraft were also identical, except towards the rear.|$|R
40|$|The HL- 20 is {{proposed}} {{as a possible}} future manned spacecraft. The configuration consists of a low-aspect-ratio body with a flat undersurface. Three fins (a small centerline fin and two outboard (tip) fins set at a dihedral angle of 50 deg) are mounted on the aft body. The control system consists of elevon surfaces on the outboard fins, a set of four body flaps on {{the upper and lower}} aft body, and an all-movable center fin. Both the elevons and body flaps were capable of trimming the model to angles of attack from - 2 deg to above 20 deg. The maximum trimmed lift-drag ratio was 3. 6. Replacing the flat-plate tip fins with airfoil tip fins increased the maximum trimmed lift-drag ratio to 4. 2. The elevons were effective as a roll control, but they produced about as much yawing moment as rolling moment because of the tip-fin dihedral angle. The body flaps produced less rolling moment than the elevons and only small values of yawing moment. A limited investigation of the effect of varying tip-fin dihedral angle indicated that a dihedral angle of 50 deg was a reasonable compromise for longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> stability, longitudinal <b>trim,</b> and performance at subsonic speeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} wind-tunnel {{investigations}} on {{the stability and}} control characteristics of externally blown jet-flap configurations are presented. Conventional wind-tunnel tests and free-flight model tests have shown that longitudinal trim and stability {{can be achieved by}} a properly located horizontal tail of sufficient size, and that <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> in the engine-out condition can be produced by combinations of differential flap, spoiler, and rudder deflection. Free-flight model tests have revealed a lightly damped Dutch roll lateral oscillation, and have shown that the oscillation can be stabilized by use of artificial damping...|$|E
40|$|Flight test {{measurements}} {{of the performance of}} the UH- 60 Black Hawk helicopter with both standard and advanced rotors are compared with calculations obtained using the comprehensive helicopter analysis CAMRAD II. In general, the calculated power coefficient shows good agreement with the flight test data. However, the accuracy of the calculation degrades at high gross weight for all of the configurations. The analysis shows fair to good correlation for collective and longitudinal cyclic angles and pitch attitude, and poor to fair correlation for the <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> quantities (lateral cyclic angle and roll attitude). The increased solidity of the wide chord blade appears to be a dominant factor in the performance improvement at high gross weight by reducing blade loading and thus delaying stall...|$|E
40|$|Three NASA centers: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Langley Research Center (LaRC), and Johnson Space Center (JSC) are {{currently}} involved in studying {{a family of}} single-stage- and two-stage-to-orbit (SSTO/TSTO) vehicles {{to serve as the}} next generation space transportation system (STS). A rocketed winged-body is the current focus. The configuration (WB 001) is a vertically-launched, horizontally-landing system with circular cross-section. Preliminary aerodynamic data was generated by LaRC and is a combination of wind-tunnel data, empirical methods, and Aerodynamic Preliminary Analysis System-(APAS) generated values. JSC's efforts involve descent trajectory design, stability analysis, and flight control system synthesis. Analysis of WB 001 's static stability indicates instability in 'tuck' (C(sub mu) less than 0 : Mach = 0. 30, alpha greater than 3. 25 deg; Mach = 0. 60, alpha greater than 8. 04), an unstable dihedral effects (C(sub l(beta)) greater than 0 : Mach = 30,alpha less than 12 deg.; Mach = 0. 60, alpha less than 10. 00 deg.), and, most significantly, an unstable weathercock stability derivative, C(sub n(beta)), at all angles of attack and subsonic Mach numbers. Longitudinal trim solutions for Mach = 0. 30 and 0. 60 indicate flight path angle possibilities ranging from around 12 (M = 0. 30) to slightly over 20 degrees at Mach = 0. 60. Trim angles of attack increase from 6. 24 at Mach 0. 60 and 10, 000 feet to 17. 7 deg. at Mach 0. 30, sea-level. <b>Lateral</b> <b>trim</b> was attempted for a design cross-wind of 25. 0 knots. The current vehicle aerodynamic and geometric characteristics will only yield a <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> solution at impractical tip-fin deflections (approximately equal to 43 deg.) and bank angles (21 deg.). A study of the lateral control surfaces, tip-fin controllers for WB 001, indicate increased surface area would help address these instabilities, particularly the deficiency in C(sub n(beta)), but obviously at the expense of increased vehicle weight. Growth factors of approximately 7 were determined using a design C(sub n(beta)) of 0. 100 /radian (approximate subsonic values for the orbiter) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an externally jet-augmented flap system that would augment lift and provide direct-lift control. The model had a 35 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 82 and two side-by-side engines mounted on a single pylon under each wing close to the fuselage. The lift of the flap system was augmented by jet engine exhaust impingement on the triple-slotted flap surfaces. The rearmost flap provided direct lift control. Results were obtained for several combinations of flap deflections at gross thrust coefficients from 0 to 2. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with four engines operating. Limited longitudinal and lateral data are presented for asymmetric and symmetric thrust conditions with three engines operating. For the same overall flap deflection, lift coefficient and maximum lift coefficient were improved 13 and 7 percent compared to coefficients obtained with a double-slotted flap configuration. A maximum lift coefficient of 6. 3 was obtained at a gross thrust coefficient of 2. 0. At the same flap deflection <b>lateral</b> and directional <b>trim</b> moment requirements with an engine inoperative were reduced 55 and 33 percent, respectively, compared to those with the engines located farther outboard on the wing. Trim moment requirements in pitch were also reduced significantly. However, pitching-moment instability occurred and increased with gross thrust coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Amid growing {{concerns}} over {{global warming and}} available management strategies for reducing cluster temperature to prevent overheating and sunburn damage, there is increasing interest in sprawling, non-positioned canopies {{as an alternative to}} traditional vertically-positioned ones. However, management of sprawling canopies needs adjustments so that a mostly erect growth pattern is maintained during the season. A three-year study (2009 â€“ 2011) was carried out to investigate the performance of 15 -yr-old Pinot noir grapevines trained to a single high-wire trellis (SHW) subjected to pre-bloom shoot trimming to retain seven (T 7) or eleven (T 11) main stem leaves. Results showed significant year x treatment interactions: with a low crop and weather conducive to post-trimming lateral re-growth in 2010, trimmed vines had higher leaf area, soluble solids concentration, pH, total anthocyanins and cluster rot incidence than control vines, whereas in 2009 and 2011 the overall must compositional pattern was reversed due to sub-optimal leaf-to-fruit ratios in the trimmed plots. The effects linked to this necessary operation are very much dependent upon unpredictable weather occurring after shoot trimming and, hence, the milder trimming severity (T 11) may more successfully balance the need of inducing a still mostly erect canopy while retaining more vine leaves to buffer any weak <b>lateral</b> formation after <b>trimming.</b> The paper provides new and useful knowledge for improved canopy management in trellises having free shoot growth due to absence of foliage wires...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic model {{tests were}} staged {{to compare the}} {{aeroelastic}} stability of a free-flying oblique-winged aircraft and the known divergent instability characterizing swept-forward wing configurations, to test the effect of wing elasticity on aileron control and trim. The aircraft fuselage was clamped in some tests and left free to roll in others. Two rigid wing panels were hinged near the wing center with elastic restraining springs. It is found that the aeroelastic divergence affecting swept-forward wings does not occur with an oblique wing, whose aeroelastic instability sets in at a dynamic pressure exceeding that for static divergence of swept-forward wings, and appears {{in the form of}} undamped oscillations. Oblique wing stability is sensitive to the moment of inertia of the fuselage in roll. Roll control and <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> are attainable with conventional ailerons, even at speeds at which divergence of a clamped forward wing shows up...|$|E
40|$|A six-degree-of-freedom {{simulation}} analysis has been performed for the Space Shuttle Orbiter during entry from Mach 10 to 2. 5 with realistic off-nominal conditions using the entry {{flight control system}} specified in May 1978. The off-nominal conditions included the following: (1) aerodynamic uncertainties, (2) an error in deriving the angle of attack from onboard instrumentation, (3) the failure {{of two of the}} four reaction control-system thrusters on each side, and (4) a lateral center-of-gravity offset. With combinations of the above off-nominal conditions, the control system performed satisfactorily with a few exceptions. The cases that did not exhibit satisfactory performance displayed the following main weaknesses. Marginal performance was exhibited at hypersonic speeds with a sensed angle-of-attack error of 4 deg. At supersonic speeds the system tended to be oscillatory, and the system diverged for several cases because of the inability to hold <b>lateral</b> <b>trim.</b> Several system modifications were suggested to help solve these problems and to maximize safety on the first flight: alter the elevon-trim and speed-brake schedules, delay switching to rudder trim until the rudder effectiveness is adequate, and reduce the overall rudder loop gain. These and other modifications were incorporated in a flight-control-system redesign in May 1979...|$|E
40|$|A six {{degree of}} freedom {{simulation}} analysis was performed for the space shuttle orbiter during entry from Mach 8 to Mach 1. 5 with realistic off nominal conditions by using the flight control systems defined by the shuttle contractor. The off nominal conditions included aerodynamic uncertainties in extrapolating from wind tunnel derived characteristics to full scale flight characteristics, uncertainties in the estimates of the reaction control system interaction with the orbiter aerodynamics, an error in deriving the angle of attack from onboard instrumentation, the failure {{of two of the}} four reaction control system thrusters on each side, and a lateral center of gravity offset coupled with vehicle and flow asymmetries. With combinations of these off nominal conditions, the flight control system performed satisfactorily. At low hypersonic speeds, a few cases exhibited unacceptable performances when errors in deriving the angle of attack from the onboard instrumentation were modeled. The orbiter was unable to maintain <b>lateral</b> <b>trim</b> for some cases between Mach 5 and Mach 2 and exhibited limit cycle tendencies or residual roll oscillations between Mach 3 and Mach 1. Piloting techniques and changes in some gains and switching times in the flight control system are suggested to help alleviate these problems...|$|E
