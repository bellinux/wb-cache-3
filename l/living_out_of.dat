In doing so he travelled extensively around the country and occasionally participated in overland treks, <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a tent or staying with local Māori. He also sailed around parts of the country aboard the Tory and learned surveying from its captain. Another employee of the company travelling on the Tory was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey by <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity {{during the night}} and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Louis Antoine de Saint-Just {{was born}} at Decize in the former Nivernais {{province}} of central France. He was the eldest child of Louis Jean de Saint-Just de Richebourg (1716–1777), a retired French cavalry officer, knight of the Order of Saint Louis, and of the 20-years younger Marie-Anne Robinot (1736–1811), {{the daughter of a}} notary. He had two younger sisters, born in 1768 and 1769. The family later moved north and in 1776 settled in the village of Blérancourt in the former Picardy province, establishing themselves as a countryside noble family <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rents from their land. A year after the move, Louis Antoine's father died leaving his mother with the three children. She saved diligently for her only son's education, and in 1779 he was sent to the Oratorian school at Soissons. After a promising start, Saint-Just acquired a reputation as a troublemaker, augmented by infamous stories (almost certainly apocryphal) of how he led a students' rebellion and tried to burn down the school. Nonetheless, he earned his graduation in 1786.|$|E

25|$|Baptism {{also became}} a public event in Geneva, with the font moved {{to the front of}} the church or even being {{attached}} to the pulpit. Confirmation was abolished, but as in Strasbourg children were expected to make a public profession of faith when able, and this became the standard rite of passage for children to be admitted to communion in Reformed churches. Puritans also saw baptism as a prophetic sign at the beginning of Christian life. Confession of sin and professions of faith (such as reciting the Apostles' Creed) were considered the fulfillment of the sign, the <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one's baptism, or improving on one's baptism.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{not certain}} {{that the first time}} someone robs a bank they will be caught, if they {{continue}} to rob banks, they will most likely be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bank robbery over the long run. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.|$|E

25|$|With the {{restoration}} of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by {{the construction of the}} Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories {{on the north side of}} the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I Komnenos's reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people. In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews. In 1182, all Latin (Western European) inhabitants of Constantinople were massacred.|$|E

Trixie was a professional singer and, during a set at Lou's Place, started to lose confidence, so Nina helped her out and saved the night. Stapleton stated that Nina and Trixie's relationship was complicated, and there were issues between them. Nina saw Trixie as an embarrassment, but she helped her out because she saw how sad her mother was. Stapleton explained more about Nina's early life saying, [...] "Nina's life has been almost a gypsy one – <b>living</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a suitcase while her parents toured.
