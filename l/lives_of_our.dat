25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|Mark Epstein is an American {{psychiatrist}} who practiced Buddhism in Thailand under Ajahn Chah {{and has since}} written several books on psychoanalysis and Buddhism (Thoughts Without a Thinker 1995, Psychotherapy Without the Self, 2008). Epstein relates the Buddhist Four Noble Truths to primary narcissism as described by Donald Winnicott in his theory on the true self and false self. The first truth highlights the inevitability of humiliation in our <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> narcissistic self-esteem. The second truth speaks of the primal thirst that makes such humiliation inevitable. The third truth promises release by developing a realistic self-image, and the fourth truth spells out the means of accomplishing that.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step}} toward achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E

500|$|The American War of Independence was the {{culmination}} of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored, the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, [...] "He has abdicated Government here... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people." [...] The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, Neighbours premiered on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles on 3 June 1991 at 5:30pm weekdays. KCOP {{planned on}} {{cancelling}} the show {{by the end}} of the month due to low ratings, but brought it back due to viewer demand at a 9:30am daily time slot from 1 July to 30 August 1991. New York City station WWOR-TV showed Neighbours weekdays 5:30pm from 17 June to 17 September 1991. In April 2004, the show began broadcasting nationally on the television channel Oxygen. A spokeswomen from the channel said [...] "Now our viewers can join in on the good, the bad and the endlessly entertaining <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Aussie neighbours." [...] The episodes started from the Scully family's arrival in 1999 and were aired for a six-week trial basis. The show was broadcast in the afternoon with two episodes being shown back to back at 1:00pm and 2:00pm. After a couple of weeks, the show was moved to a late-night time slot and it eventually left the air. On 7 July 2014, Todd Spangler from Variety reported that FremantleMedia International had signed a deal with U.S. subscription service Hulu giving it exclusive rights to the most recent season of Neighbours. The soap began airing from 14 July, with new episodes airing daily from Monday through to Friday, on Hulu and Hulu Plus services. The episodes were four weeks behind the Australian broadcast. All past and current episodes of Neighbours were removed from Hulu on 19 September 2015, stating they had lost the rights.|$|E

The judges said that he was clearly not the only person responsible for the tragedy and they accepted that his negligence did not amount to an intent to kill. The chief engineer of the ferry, identified by his surname Park, was found guilty of murder and jailed for 30 years. Thirteen other crew members were given jail sentences of up to 20 years on charges including abandonment and violating maritime law. Relatives of victims were distraught at the verdict, with some weeping. The AFP news agency reported that one woman screamed in the courtroom: [...] "It's not fair.

[...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found out that we couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all {{we were going to}} do was just waste the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|E
