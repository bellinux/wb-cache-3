He described this in 2006: [...] "I have gotten in grooves before, {{and you try to}} stay in it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> until it ends. And it does end. I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
500|$|The {{sky hook}} used to rescue Bond {{at the end}} of the film was a rescue system used by the United States {{military}} at the time. At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the breathing bag, while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hold your breath." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{large number}} of {{contemporary}} roller derby leagues are amateur, self-organized and all-female [...] and were formed in a DIY spirit by relatively new roller derby enthusiasts. In many leagues (particularly but not exclusively in the U.S.), a punk aesthetic and/or third-wave feminist ethic is prominent. Furthermore, roller derby teams are typically composed of members of various social strata such as stay-at-home mothers, lawyers, and nurses, and [...] "Being gay/straight/bi/trans is simply no big deal, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> skate."

2500|$|While on his 2003 tour {{to promote}} his novel, Diary, Palahniuk read to his audiences a short story entitled, [...] "Guts," [...] a sensational tale of {{accidents}} involving masturbation, which appears in his book, Haunted. The story begins with the author telling his listeners to inhale deeply and that [...] "this story should last about as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hold your breath." [...] It was reported that forty people had fainted listening to the readings while holding their breath. Playboy magazine later published the story in their March 2004 issue and Palahniuk offered to let them publish another story along with it, but the publishers found the second work too disturbing to publish. On his tour to promote [...] {{during the summer of}} 2004, he read [...] "Guts" [...] to audiences again, bringing the total number of fainters up to 53 (and later up to 60 while on tour to promote the softcover edition of Diary). In the fall of that year, he began promoting Haunted, and continued to read [...] "Guts." [...] In June 2005, Palahniuk noted that his number of fainters was up to 67. The last fainting occurred on May 28, 2007, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, where 5 people fainted, one of whom fell and hit his head on the door while trying to leave the auditorium. Since then audio recordings of his readings of the story have been circulated on the Internet. In the afterword of the latest edition of [...] "Haunted," [...] Palahniuk reported that [...] "Guts" [...] had been responsible for 73 fainting events.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{promised to}} renegotiate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform to the {{unemployment}} insurance system. In regards to NAFTA, the Red Book pronounced itself {{in favor of}} a North American free trade zone in principle, but went on to accuse Mulroney of having given away too much to the Americans and Mexicans when he signed NAFTA in 1992, and stated that the Liberal government would renegotiate NAFTA on more favorable terms to Canada within six months of taking office. Failing that, the Red Book promised that Canada would renounce NAFTA. The main emphasis in the Red Book was on a promise to spend $6billion on improving infrastructure in a Keynesian move to fight the recession of the early 1990s. As regarding the debt situation, Chrétien promised in the Red Book to reduce Canada's deficit to 3 per cent of GDP (the same deficit to GDP ratio required to enter the European Union) within three years of taking office. Chrétien {{made it clear that the}} 3% deficit to GDP ratio would apply only to the federal government, whereas the Maastricht Treaty of 1991 which set out the 3% deficit to GDP ratio in order to enter the European Union stated that this applied to all levels of government. The Red Book went on to promise that a Liberal government would achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to 3% of the GDP by cancelling the contract to buy the Sea King helicopters and to privatise Pearson airport in Toronto and by eliminating unspecified [...] "waste" [...] in the government. After the 3% target had been achieved within the first three years of taking office, the Red Book promised that the deficit would be eliminated at some unspecified time in the future. Martin, who had been the leader of the team that had produced the Red Book had wanted to promise to eliminate the deficit altogether, but had been overruled by Chrétien, who had wanted to present the Liberals as the [...] "caring" [...] party that would defend social programs, unlike the [...] "heartless" [...] Tories and the Reform Party who Chrétien claimed wanted to eliminate the deficit within two or three years by gutting social programs with no thought for any suffering that this might cause. Chrétien claimed in his campaign speeches that Reform's plans for eliminate the deficit within two or three years of taking office would cause at least a 25% unemployment rate, if not higher, which Chrétien claimed starkly in a series of speeches would cause a bloody [...] "revolution". Chrétien had personally chosen the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP as it made the Liberals seemed fiscally responsible while at the same time promised that the Liberals would not inflict too much economic pain to achieve that fiscal responsibility. One Liberal candidate Herb Dhaliwal recalled that for Chrétien at time of the 1993 election that the national deficit was not a major issue and that: [...] "His attitude was that the deficit is ok as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> manage it". To support its economic claims, the Red Book gave costs for each of the Liberals' policy goalsthe first time a Canadian party had gone to such lengths to prove that its proposals were fiscally responsible.|$|E

500|$|For {{her second}} Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson's character, Susan, is {{described}} as that of an [...] "ambitious, long-suffering wife" [...] who {{has to deal with}} her husband's infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were [...] "blown away" [...] by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated [...] "LA is lovely <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> leave". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).|$|R
