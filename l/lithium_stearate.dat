50|$|Soaps are {{the most}} common {{emulsifying}} agent used, and the selection of the type of soap is determined by the application.

50|$|Soaps are salts of fatty acids. In the {{domestic}} setting, sodium-based and potassium-based soaps {{are commonly used}} as natural cleaning surfactants. The most useful of the non-detergent soaps are those based on lithium, as they are free of corrosive properties.

40|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> {{soap and}} layered MoS 2 {{nanoparticles}} encapsulated in <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> soap are prepared in the laboratory, and their lubricating properties are compared {{with respect to}} the particle and particle concentration. The tribotracks after friction test was investigated with Raman Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3 D optical profilometry to understand the action mechanism. The status of the soap particles on a tribotrack changes with time, contact pressure and sliding speed. At low pressure and speed, individual solid undeformed soap particle stand proud of the surface and the topography shows marginal difference with sliding time. In these conditions, no frictional difference between the performance of grease with and without the nanoparticles is observed. Increasing the contact pressure and temperature (low speed and high speed) has a dramatic effect as the soap particles melt and the liquid soap flows over the track releasing the hitherto encapsulated nanoparticles. Consequently, the soap smears the track like a liquid, and the nanoparticles now come directly into the interface and are sheared to generate a low-friction tribofilm. At high particle concentration, the sliding time required for melting of the soap and release of MoS 2 is reduced, and the tribofilm is more substantial and uniform consisting of smeared MoS 2 and carboxylate soap as observed by SEM and 3 D optical profilometry. A change in the Raman Spectra is observed with particle concentration, and this is related to morphology and microstructure of the tribofilm generated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Thevetia peruviana and Jatropha {{curcas seed}} oils were {{investigated}} as feed stocks for grease production. Seven different blends of Thevetia peruviana and Jatropha curcas seed oil {{were used for}} this research. The seeds were obtained locally and oven dried until a constant weight was obtained, Thevetia peruviana seeds had 3. 91 % moisture content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 2. 93 % moisture content. The oils were thereafter extracted. Thevetia peruviana seeds {{were found to have}} 58. 5 % oil content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 54. 6 % oil content. The Chemo-physical tests of the oils indicated that the density of the oils were the same (908. 7 kg/m 3), and the flash point of Thevetia peruviana seed oil was 168 o C while that of Jatropha curcas seed oil was 122 o C; the viscosity at 100 o C for both oils fell within the range of 7. 2 - 7. 9 cSt for 400 pale oil 400 p, which is of petroleum origin. The viscosity index values for both oils were very high, hence very stable. Jatropha curcas oil had a viscosity index of 214 and Thevetia peruviana oil had 202. The grease was produced by cooking a calculated quantity of base oil and <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> in a pot at 200 o C with continuous stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction was allowed to cool to 85 o C before sodium thiosulphate and calcium sulphonate additives were added to the reactor; further milling was maintained to yield a homogeneous product (<b>lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> grease) which were taken for analysis.

40|$|VCE is an ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol {{terpolymer}} binder for filled elastomers {{which is}} designed to accept high filler loadings. Filled elastomer parts consist of the binder (VCE), a curing agent (Hylene MP, diphenol- 4 - 4 {prime}-methylenebis(phenylcarbamate)), a processing aid (LS, <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate),</b> and filler particles (typically 70 % fraction by weight). The curing of the filled elastomer parts occurs from the heat-activated reaction between the hydroxyl groups of VCE with the Hylene MP curing agent, resulting in a cross-linked network. The final vinyl acetate content is typically between 34. 9 and 37. 9 %, while the vinyl alcohol content is typically between 1. 27 and 1. 78 %. Surveillance data for this material is both scarce and scattered, complicating the assessment of any aging trends in systems. In addition, most of the initial surveillance efforts focused on mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength, and chemical information is therefore lacking. Material characterization and aging studies had been performed on previous formulations of the VCE material but the Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) starting copolymer is no longer commercially available. New formulations with replacement EVA materials are currently being established and will require characterization as well as updated aging models...|$|E
40|$|NoA {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between compaction, sintering, microstructural and mechanical properties of the 6061 aluminium alloy prepared via premixed elemental (EL) and prealloyed (PA) powders (as received and degassed) with and without additions of sintering aids and various solid and/or liquid lubricants. Both EL and PA powders were cold pressed at different pressures, ranging from 250 to 770 MPa, and sintered under vacuum in the range 580 - 640 °C for 30 - 120 min. and then under pure nitrogen atmosphere for comparison. Vacuum degassing of the PA powder provided better compressibility and thus higher green densities than those for the as received PA or the premixed EL powder compacts pressed at compaction pressures ¿ 340 MPa. Near full sintered densities of ~ 98 %TD were obtained for both EL and PA 6061 Al alloys. Degassed PA Al with 0 · 6 wt-% paraffin wax (PW) or with only 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant, and premixed EL with only 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition and no lubricant gave the best optimum properties. It became apparent that additions of some solid lubricants such as <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> (LS) and acrawax to both the premixed EL and PA powders provided reasonable green densities, but had deleterious effect on sintered densities and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering. Heating data curves during the sintering cycle, revealed formation of both transient and persistent liquid phases for the EL and mainly supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) mechanism for the PA. Tensile properties of the degassed, vacuum or nitrogen sintered PA Al alloy in T 6 condition were {{higher than those of}} the equivalent alloy prepared by EL mixing with the former giving a tensile strength of 330 MPa and 6 - 8 % elongation to failure, which {{are similar to those of}} the commercial (wrought) 6061 Al alloys...|$|E
40|$|NoPhysical and {{mechanical}} properties for prealloyed 6061 Al powder processed {{with and without}} additions of solid and/or liquid lubricants and sintering aids (Pb, Sn, Ag) are presented. For comparison, both vacuum and nitrogen sintering were carried out on as received (gas atomised) and degassed powder compacts pressed at 340 and 510 MPa. Vacuum degassing of the prealloyed powder provided better compressibility and thus higher green densities than those for the as received powder. Highest sintered densities of ~ 98 - 99 % of theoretical were obtained for the prealloyed (and degassed) Al compacts by sintering under pure nitrogen with an addition of 0 · 6 wt-% paraffin wax as solid lubricant or 1 · 33 vol. -% liquid paraffin, or with a 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant. It was found that additions of solid lubricants such as <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate</b> and acrawax to both the premixed (elemental) and prealloyed powders provided reasonable green densities of ~ 94 · 5 - 95 · 5 % TD, but had deleterious effect on sintered densities and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering. Other lubricants such as zinc stearate, stearic acid and liquid paraffin provided similar green densities, but higher sintered densities and less porous microstructures, particularly by sintering under pure nitrogen. The prealloyed compacts sintered under pure nitrogen consistently provided much higher sintered densities than elementally premixed compacts sintered under pure nitrogen or vacuum. It is therefore concluded that both lubricant type and sintering atmosphere will have a major effect on the sintered properties of the 6061 Al powder. Sintering under pure nitrogen resulted in higher sintered densities as compared with vacuum sintering for this grade of Al alloy. Tensile properties of the degassed and vacuum sintered (and T 6 tempered) prealloyed powder compacts were {{higher than those of}} the equivalent alloy prepared by elemental mixing and comparable with those of the commercial (wrought) 6061 Al alloys...|$|E
40|$|Our {{primary goal}} {{in this thesis}} was to develop {{convenient}} methods for the synthesis of oligomeric polycyclics which could be ring-opened at elevated temperatures {{in the presence of}} a catalyst to give new classes of thermoset materials. A simple and commercially attractive approach was utilized to synthesize novolac type resins by reacting p-substituted phenols with formaldehyde using a cation exchange resin as catalyst in the presence of chlorobenzene as solvent. Novel oligomeric polycyclic carbonates were prepared by reacting the multifunctional phenol-formaldehyde resin with excess triphosgene under high dilution conditions. When the oligomeric polycyclic carbonates were heated at elevated temperatures using an initiator, a highly cross-linked network was obtained. In addition, the polycyclics were mixed with a commercial BPA polycarbonate and cured at different temperatures {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. When the mixture of BPA polycarbonate with 10 wt. % polycyclic carbonate was cured at 350 ºC for 30 min. using a catalytic amount of <b>lithium</b> <b>stearate,</b> it gave a highly cross-linked network. Two series of polycyclic phosphonates were synthesized by reacting the oligomeric phenol-formaldehyde resins with phosphonic dichlorides under high dilution conditions in a polar aprotic solvent. The polycyclic phosphonates were similarly subjected to ring-opening polymerization at elevated temperatures in the presence of an initiator. The crosslinked phosphonates exhibited good flame retardance properties. Two classes of oligomeric siloxane resins were also synthesized by reacting the phenol-formaldehyde novolac type resins with dialkyl or diaryl dichloro, silanes under high dilution conditions. The formation of predominantly polycyclic siloxane structures was revealed by MALDI-TOF MS, Gradient HPLC and 1 H NMR. Blends of commercial polysiloxane gums with different proportions of polycyclic siloxane resins were subjected to curing at 300 ºC in the presence of KOH catalyst. Polysiloxane gums are highly unstable at 300 ºC in the presence of a basic catalyst. However, the cross-linked polysiloxane gum at 30 wt. % loading of polycyclic siloxanes, was sufficiently stable at this temperature. A Bisphenol A dimer (o, o' methylene bridged) was synthesized by a single-pot reaction between formaldehyde and excess BPA using cation exchange resin catalyst. A few novel classes of oligomeric polycyclics with low melt viscosities were synthesized from this dimer under high dilution conditions. A series of co-polycarbonates of BPA were synthesized by the reaction of methylene bridged dimer with BPA and triphosgene. An alternative in-situ polymerization method was also developed to synthesize the BPA co-polycarbonates. These co-polymers containing cross-linkable cyclic carbonate moieties on the backbone, gave thermoset materials when cured at elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst. Low molecular weight poly(aryl ether sulfone) s end-capped with metallophthalocyanine moieties were prepared by reacting poly(aryl ether sulfone) s containing o-phthalonitrile end-groups with excess phthalonitrile and metals/metal salts in quinoline. These polymers were characterized in detail by using IR, UV-VIS, 1 H NMR and GPC techniques. Annealing studies on the polymers containing PcM end-groups were undertaken in order to investigate the occurrence of stacking of plithalocyanine rings in the melt. This study was conducted by using a Thermo-Gravimettic/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) instrument...|$|E
