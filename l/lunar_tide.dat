25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is {{the time it takes}} to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> raising force.|$|E

Its maximum pressure amplitude near {{the ground is}} 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal. Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100 km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.|$|E
50|$|A third {{influence}} {{occurs because}} the moon orbits {{at an angle}} to the equator. This means that if one of the bulges travelling around the earth is above the equator, then the other bulge is below the equator. It also follows that some places will have one daily diurnal tide, while other places will have semi-diurnal tides twice a day. For example, there is a diurnal tide in the Ross Sea near Antarctica every 24.84 hours. The height of this tide dwindles to almost zero in a cycle which takes 13.66 days. New Zealand's tides are semi-diurnal. The primary cause, the <b>lunar</b> <b>tide,</b> is labelled the M2. The M stands for the moon and the 2 stands for twice a day.|$|E

We conclude that moons are more stable when the planet/moon systems are further from the parent star, the planets are heavier, or the parent stars are lighter. Inclusion of <b>lunar</b> <b>tides</b> allows for significantly longer lifetimes for a massive moon relative to prior formulations.

50|$|Tide {{range is}} the {{vertical}} {{distance between the}} highest high tide and lowest low tide. The size of the <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> compared to the solar tide (which comes once every 12 hours) is generally about 2 to 1, but the actual proportion along any particular shore depends on the location, orientation, {{and shape of the}} local bay or estuary. Along some shorelines, the solar tide is the only important tide, and ordinary 12-hour clocks suffice since the high and low tides come at nearly the same time every day. Because ordinary tidal clocks only track a part of the tidal effect, and because the relative size of the combined effects is different in different places, they are in general only partially accurate for tracking the tides. Consequently, all navigators use tide tables either in a booklet, computer or digital tide clock.|$|E

Excepting the Gulf of Maine, <b>lunar</b> <b>tides</b> are either static or slightly increasing in amplitude; a few stations show decreases.

5000|$|Cook Strait has tidal flows {{amongst the}} strongest in the world, {{even though it}} has a smaller tidal range than most places in New Zealand.

On the Pacific Ocean side the high tide occurs five hours before it occurs at the Tasman Sea side. On one side is high tide and on the other is low tide. The difference in sea level can drive tidal currents up to 2.5 metres per second (5 knots) across Cook Strait as well as into the Tory Channel.

5000|$|Tides have an {{inherent}} lead or lag, {{known as the}} lunitidal interval, that is different at every location, so tidal clocks are set for {{the time when the}} local lunar high tide occurs. This is often complicated because the lead or lag varies {{during the course of the}} lunar month, as the lunar and solar tides fall into and out of synchronization. The <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> and solar tide are synchronized (ebb and flow at the same time) near the full moon and the new moon. The two tides are unsynchronized near the first and last quarter moon (or [...] "half moon"). Also, in addition to the relative position of the moon and the elliptical pattern of the sun, the tide can be affected to some degree by wind and atmospheric pressure. All of these variables have less impact on the tide at the time of the full moon, so this is usually the best time to set a tide clock. If the tide clock is mounted on a moving boat, it will need to be reset more frequently. The best time to set the clock is at the new moon or the full moon, which is also when the clock can most reliably indicate the actual combined tide. A simple tide clock will always be least reliable near the quarter moon.|$|E

High winds in Atlantic City destroyed the windows of storefronts. Along the Jersey coast, the nor'easter produced waves of up to 25 ft in height.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many decades that lunar tidal effects in the {{equatorial}} electrojet are greatest during northern winter; the mechanism of which has never been identified. Recent findings of the lunar tidal amplification during stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events raise the question: To what extent do SSWs contribute to the large <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> during northern winter? We use ground magnetometer data at Addis Ababa for the years 1958 - 2007 to determine the average M- 2 <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> in the equatorial electrojet at different seasons. When all the data are included, the amplitude of the <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> is largest during northern winter. However, when only the data for non-SSW winters are used, the amplitude during northern winter is not significantly larger than during other seasons. The M- 2 amplitude during SSW events is approximately 3 times as large as that for non-SSW winters, and it considerably increases the amplitude of the average <b>lunar</b> <b>tide</b> during northern winter. The M- 2 phase is not significantly affected by SSW events.

40|$|The working {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} is that periodic <b>lunar</b> nodal <b>tides</b> and almost periodic solar radiation variations influence sea level changes through their harmonic beating of nearby natural and/or forced broadband oscillations of the sea level at multi-decadal frequencies. The presence of the harmonics of the <b>lunar</b> nodal <b>tides</b> and the solar radiation variations, including the pole tides, is investigated by modeling and estimating the amplitudes of the corresponding periodicities in 27 globally distributed long tide gauge records. Statistically significant signatures of sub and superharmonics of <b>lunar</b> nodal <b>tides</b> and forced sea level variations due to solar radiation are detected in all station records. Meta-analysis of the harmonic amplitudes from all stations reveals that the effect sizes are statistically significant and provide evidence for the harmonic beating of sea level changes as a global phenomenon. Consequently, the compounding of the <b>lunar</b> nodal <b>tides</b> and forced sea level changes due to solar radiation with other broadband natural and forced sea level oscillations is a plausible explanation for the recent sea level accelerations and decelerations detected by satellite altimetry measurements and long tidal records...|$|R
