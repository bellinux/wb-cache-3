5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|Connections among Coolbrith's {{circle of}} friends {{resulted}} in a librarian job at San Francisco's Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> {{that she was able}} to devote a greater proportion of her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.|$|E

5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the Highlands and Islands, the longship was {{gradually}} succeeded by (in ascending order of size) the birlinn, highland galley and lymphad, which, were clinker-built ships, usually with a centrally-stepped mast, {{but also with}} oars {{that allowed them to}} be rowed. Like the longship, they had a high stem and stern, and were still small and <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be dragged across portages, but they replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century. They could fight at sea, but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies. However, they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of DÃ¡l Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to feudal obligations, with Celtic-Scandinavian lords, who had previously contributed {{as a result of a}} general levy on landholding, coming to hold their lands in exchange for specified numbers and sizes of ships supplied to the king. This process probably began in the thirteenth century, but would be intensified under Robert I. The importance of these ships was underlined by their becoming common in depictions on grave markers and in heraldry throughout the Highlands and Islands.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the United Kingdom's {{overseas}} commitments were proving costly to garrison and were {{a drain on}} the defence budget. A new strategy was proposed, that troops and equipment would be airlifted to trouble-spots from their bases in Europe. To support the air-landed troops, a requirement was identified for an AFV that could provide fire support with an anti-armour capability and be <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be airportable.

25|$|On 11 May 2016, the U.S. Army {{disclosed}} that the JLTV {{is to be}} used as the platform for the upcoming Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) program rather than procuring a new system. The LRV is to be an off-road platform for carrying a suite of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors; it is to be <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be carried by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The JLTV has been described as an interim LRV solution, and {{there is a possibility that}} evaluation of JLTV in the LRV role will determine if a change is necessary.|$|E
25|$|The Panzerfaust 3 is <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to {{be carried}} and fired by one person. It can be fired from {{enclosures}} since {{it does not have}} a significant backblast; the rear of the tube, filled with plastic granulate, minimises the blast effect by the so-called recoilless countermass principle. The booster propellant for the projectile in its tube is ignited by a bolt via a spring mechanism. Once ejected from the launcher, the projectile coasts a safe distance and then the rocket motor is ignited, boosting it to its maximum speed, after which it coasts until impact. The gunner carries at least two rounds while the assistant grenadier carries an additional three rounds.|$|E
25|$|Cab {{arrangements}} vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. {{has traditionally}} been for a cab {{at one end of}} the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or B units) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.|$|E

25|$|The Leyland Titan TD1 was {{unveiled}} at the Commercial Motor show at London's Olympia exhibition hall in November 1927, {{it was then}} unique amongst double deckers in having a <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> frame to run two-axled on pneumatic tyres (two at the front and four at the back) yet carry 52 passengers in a bus of 25ft overall length, with such refinements as a six-cylinder overhead-camshaft petrol engine and an unprecedentedly-low frame. The Tiger TS1 was its singleâdeck counterpart. The wheelbase was slightly longer at 17ft 6in allowing bodywork up to 27ft 6in long, with up to 35 seats. The first Tiger TS1 (chassis 60001A), bodied by Leyland was loaned in March 1927 to H.M.S. Catherwood Ltd of Belfast, it was purchased by them and, sold to other firms, it worked in Ireland until 1940.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one ball joint firing port on either side and cover of the rear hatch to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a hydropneumatic suspension system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} base vehicle for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E
25|$|Because {{siliceous}} magmas are so viscous, {{they tend}} to trap volatiles (gases) that are present, which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically, eventually forming stratovolcanoes. Pyroclastic flows (ignimbrites) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere, so they hug the volcano's slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 1,200Â°C are known to occur in pyroclastic flows, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often up to many meters thick. Alaska's Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, formed by the eruption of Novarupta near Katmai in 1912, {{is an example of}} a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit. Volcanic ash that is <b>light</b> <b>enough</b> to be erupted high into the Earth's atmosphere may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a tuff.|$|E
