5000|$|The {{revealing}} of autowave <b>lacet</b> may {{be important}} for cardiology. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave [...] "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), {{the tip of the}} rotating wave [...] "sticks" [...] to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition from polymorphic to monomorphic tachycardia is observed on the ECG in such cases. This phenomenon is called the [...] "anchoring" [...] of spiral wave.However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet; in other words, the <b>lacet</b> may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic. Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called [...] "lacetic", which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.|$|E

Such embeddings are characterized, up to homotopy, by a combinatorial <b>lacet,</b> that is, by a double occurrence word Δ on an alphabet P and a bipartition (K,L) of the set P, P representing the set of self-intersections of the curve, Δ their sequence in one complete run along the curve, and K,L {{the two types of}} reentry possible at a crossing. Passing by the construction of a map associated to the <b>lacet,</b> we show that every combinatorial <b>lacet</b> is representable on a 2 -manifold. Beginning with a problem on curves in the plane posed and partially solved by Gauss (1840), and introducing certain linear transformations of vector spaces over GF(2), depending on Δ and (K,L), Rosenstiehl [C.

We prove here that a characterisation of the same sort extends naturally to the case of arbitrary 2 -manifolds. In particular, we present procedures for determining if a combinatorial <b>lacet</b> is representable on the torus, or on the Klein bottle...|$|E

40|$|The {{first half}} of the present memoir is devoted to KAM theory and \textsc{Arnold}'s theorem for several planets in space, as {{detailed}} in one preprint and one article:\footnote{\url{[URL] [...] ''Twisted conjugacies and invariant tori theorems~\cite{Fejoz: 2010 a}. I reprove a normal form theorem due to \textsc{Moser}~\cite{Moser: 1967 }, for perturbations of a vector field having a Diophantine quasi-periodic invariant torus. This normal form, which I call a \emph{twisted conjugacy}, is a gateway to invariant tori theorems of \textsc{Kolmogorov}, \textsc{Arnold}, \textsc{Rüssmann} and \textsc{Herman}, as well as to some other theorems, for example for dissipative vector fields. I introduce a \emph{hypothetical conjugacy}, i. e. a conjugacy depending on arithmetical properties of the perturbed frequency vector, as an intermediate step towards invariant tori theorems with weak non-degeneracy conditions, I improve some estimates on the functional dependance of the normal form, and give some new applications to celestial mechanics. [...] ''Démonstration du théorème d'Arnold sur la stabilité du système planétaire (d'après Herman) ''~\cite{Fejoz: 2004 }. Arnold's theorem is proved for $N$ planets in space. (The proof included in~\cite{Fejoz: 2010 a} is a clarification and an improvement of the abstract part of~\cite{Fejoz: 2004 }.) \textsc{Arnold} remarkably asserted, in the Newtonian model of the planetary problem with $N$ planets, the existence of an invariant set of positive Lebesgue measure, foliated in quasi-periodic invariant tori of dimension $ 3 N- 1 $~\cite{Arnold: 1963 }. \textsc{Arnold}'s suggestion for proving the result in full generality was to fix the direction of the angular momentum vector, in order {{to get rid of a}} degeneracy due to the rotational invariance of the problem, and then to apply his degenerate version of Kolmogorov's theorem to find Lagrangian tori in the neighborhood of the elliptic secular singularity (circular horizontal Keplerian ellipses). This strategy of partial reduction fails because of a mysterious resonance, discovered by \textsc{Herman}, which generalizes the resonance found by \textsc{Clairaut} in the first order lunar problem. This resonance had not been noticed in the context of KAM theory because in the $ 2 $-planet problem, \textsc{Jacobi}'s reduction of the node makes it possible to carry out the full symplectic reduction by rotations in \textsc{Delaunay}'s coordinates (I recall the definition of these coordinates in the appendix of this memoir, and give a new proof of their symplecticity). Here it is proved by induction on the number of planets, following Herman, that the local image of the frequency map of the planetary system (as a function of the semi major axes), is contained in a vector plane of codimension two, and in no vector plane of larger codimension. Using an argument of Lagrangian intersection theory, this allows us to apply an invariant tori theorem with a weak (or Rüssmann-) non-degeneracy condition. The second half of the memoir deals with periodic and relatively periodic orbits in the global many-body problem. It is based on two publications. [...] ''The flow of the equal-mass spatial 3 -body problem in the neighborhood of the equilateral relative equilibrium'' (with A. Chenciner) ~\cite{Chenciner: 2008 }. It is shown that exactly two families of relatively periodic orbits bifurcate from the Lagrange equilateral triangle, namely the homographic and the $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$ families. Moreover, in restriction to the $ 4 $-dimensional center manifold, the local dynamics is proved to be a twist map of an annulus of section, bounded by the two families. Another paper shows that the $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$ family ends at the Eight~\cite{Chenciner: 2005 a}. In between, the $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$ family is known to exist as a family of minimizers of the Lagrangian action within its symmetry class for all values of the rotation of the frame. Such a family could be non-unique, or not continuous, but numerical experiments indicate that it is not the case (see the pictures above). [...] ''Unchained polygons and the {$N$}-body problem'' (with A. Chenciner) ~\cite{Chenciner: 2009 }. The Lagrange relative equilibrium appears above as the organizing center of the Eight. We show that the same phenomenon occurs with the equal-mass relative equilibrium of the square, which appears as the organizing center of the Hip-Hop. More generally, many recently studied classes of periodic solutions bifurcate from symmetric relative equilibria. In a rotating frame where they become periodic, these families acquire remarkable symmetries. We study the possibility of continuing these families globally as action minimizers in a rotating frame, among loops sharing the same symmetries. In a preliminary step we estimate the intervals of the frame rotation frequency over which the relative equilibrium is the sole absolute action minimizer. Then we focus on our main example, the relative equilibrium of the equal-mass regular $N$-gon. The proof of the local existence of the vertical Lyapunov families relies on the fact that the restriction to the corresponding directions of the quadratic part of the energy is positive definite. We compute the symmetry groups $G_{\frac rs}(N,k,\eta) $ of the vertical Lyapunov families observed in appropriate rotating frames, and use them for continuing the families globally. Paradigmatic families are the Eight families for an odd number of bodies and the Hip-Hop families for an even number. It is precisely for these two kinds of families that global minimization may be used. In the other cases, obstructions to the method come from isomorphisms between the symmetries of different families; this is the case for the so-called chain choreographies, where only a local minimization property is true (except for $N= 3 $). Another interesting feature of these chains is the deciding role played by the parity, in particular through the value of the angular momentum. For the Lyapunov families bifurcating from the regular $N$-gon with $N\leq 6 $, we check in an appendix that locally the torsion is not zero, which justifies taking the rotation of the frame as a parameter. This article illustrates how fertile symmetry considerations are, not only as a proof technique, but also in the heuristic search for remarkable solutions. The many-body problem has been at the origin of numerous mathematical theories. And because of the variety of techniques its study demands, it retains all of its fascination. La première moitié de ce mémoire est consacrée à la théorie KAM et au théorème d'Arnold sur la stabilité des systèmes planétaires. Ce travail a fait l'objet d'un article en préparation et d'une publication~:\footnote{ \url{[URL] [...] ''Twisted conjugacies and invariant tori theorems''~\cite{Fejoz: 2010 a}. Je redémontre une forme normale de champs de vecteurs due à Moser~\cite{Moser: 1967 }, pour les perturbations de champs de vecteurs admettant un tore invariant quasi-périodique diophantien. Cette forme normale, que j'appelle une \emph{conjugaison tordue} est une porte d'entrée pour démontrer des théorèmes de tores invariants dus à Kolmogorov, Arnold, Rüssmann et Herman, ainsi que d'autres théorèmes, par exemple pour des champs de vecteurs dissipatifs. J'introduis une notion de \emph{conjugaison hypothétique}, comme un intermédiaire commun aux théorèmes de tores invariants avec une condition de non-dégénérescence faible, améliore certaines estimations sur la dépendance fonctionnelle de la forme normale, et donne quelques applications nouvelles à la mécanique céleste. [...] ''Démonstration du théorème d'Arnold sur la stabilité du système planétaire (d'après Herman) ''~\cite{Fejoz: 2004 }. Cet article donne une démonstration du théorème d'Arnold pour $N$ planètes dans l'espace $\R^ 3 $. La démonstration de~\cite{Fejoz: 2010 a} est une clarification et une amélioration de la partie abstraite de ~\cite{Fejoz: 2004 }. Arnold avait publié le résultat remarquable suivant~: dans le problème planétaire newtonien à $N$ planètes, si les masses des planètes sont assez petites, il existe dans l'espace des phases un sous-ensemble invariant de mesure de Lebesgue strictement positive, formé de tores invariants quasipériodiques de dimension $ 3 N- 1 $~\cite{Arnold: 1963 }. La suggestion d'Arnold pour le démontrer en toute généralité était de fixer la direction du moment cinétique, pour se débarrasser de la dégénérescence due à l'invariance par rotation, puis d'appliquer sa version dégénérée du théorème de Kolmogorov pour trouver des tores lagrangiens invariants au voisinage de la singularité séculaire elliptique (mouvements képlériens elliptiques circulaires horizontaux). Cette stratégie de réduction partielle ne marche pas à cause d'une résonance mystérieuse, découverte par Herman, qui généralise à $N$ planètes une résonance déjà connue de Clairaut dans le problème de la lune. Cette résonance n'avait pas été remarquée dans le cas de $ 2 $ planètes, où la réduction des noeuds de Jacobi permet de réduire complètement le problème par la symétrie de rotation, en coordonnées de Delaunay (je rappelle en appendice la définition de ces coordonnées, et propose une nouvelle démonstration de leur caractère symplectique). Ici, je démontre par récurrence sur le nombre de planètes, en suivant les idées d'Herman, que l'image locale de l'application fréquence (vue comme fonction des demi grands axes des planètes) est contenue dans un plan vectoriel de codimension deux, mais dans aucun plan vectoriel de codimension supérieure. Un argument de la théorie des intersections lagrangiennes permet alors d'appliquer un théorème de tores invariants qui ne requiert qu'une faible condition de non-dégénérescence. La seconde moitié de ce mémoire traite d'orbites périodiques et relativement périodiques (i. e. périodiques en repère tournant), dans le problème global des $N$ corps. Elle aussi est basée sur deux articles. [...] ''The flow of the equal-mass spatial 3 -body problem in the neighborhood of the equilateral relative equilibrium'' (avec A. Chenciner) ~\cite{Chenciner: 2008 }. Nous démontrons qu'exactement deux familles de solutions relativement périodiques bifurquent de la solution d'équilibre relatif de Lagrange~: la famille homographique et la famille $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$. De plus, en restriction à la variété centrale de dimension $ 4 $ de l'équilibre relatif de Lagrange, la dynamique locale est une application twist d'un anneau de section, bordé par les deux familles. Un autre article montre que la famille $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$ se termine, de l'autre côté, à la solution en Huit de Chenciner-Montgomery~\cite{Chenciner: 2005 a}. Entre ces deux extrémités, on sait que la famille $\mathcal{P}_{ 12 }$ existe comme famille des minima de l'action lagrangienne parmi les <b>lacets</b> possédant sa classe de symétrie. Une telle famille pourrait a priori être non unique, ou discontinue, mais les expériences numériques ne laissent guère de doute (voir la figure dans la préface). [...] ''Unchained polygons and the {$N$}-body problem'' (avec A. Chenciner) ~\cite{Chenciner: 2009 }. L'équilibre relatif de Lagrange apparaît dans ce qui précède comme le centre organisateur du Huit. Nous montrons que le même phénomène se produit avec l'équilibre relatif du carré à quatre masses égales, qui apparaît comme centre organisateur de la famille du Hip-Hop. Plus généralement, beaucoup de classes de solutions récemment découvertes appartiennent aux familles de Lyapunov issues d'équilibres relatifs symétriques. Dans un repère tournant où elles deviennent périodiques, ces familles acquièrent des symétries remarquables. Nous étudions la possibilité de les prolonger globalement comme minima de l'action lagrangienne en un repère tournant, au sein de leur classe de symétrie. Une étape préliminaire est de déterminer les intervalles de la fréquence de rotation du repère sur lesquels un équilibre relatif est l'unique minimum absolu de l'action. Nous nous focalisons ensuite sur notre exemple principal, l'équilibre relatif du polygone régulier à $N$ sommets. L'existence locale de familles de Lyapunov verticales repose sur le fait que la restriction de la partie quadratique de l'énergie aux directions centrales est définie positive. Nous calculons les groupes de symétrie $G_{\frac rs}(N,k,\eta) $ des familles de Lyapunov verticales, et les utilisons pour prolonger les familles globalement. Les exemples paradigmatiques sont les familles de Huits pour un nombre impair de corps et les familles de Hip-Hops pour un nombre pair. Ce sont précisément les éléments de ces deux types de familles qui peuvent être des minima globaux. Dans les autres cas, des obstructions apparaissent, qui sont dues à des isomorphismes entre les groupes de symétrie de différentes famille~; c'est le cas des \emph{chaînes chorégraphiques}, dont les éléments sont seulement des minima locaux (sauf pour $N= 3 $). Une autre particularité intéressante de ces chaînes est le rôle décisif joué par la parité, en particulier à travers la valeur prise par le moment cinétique. Pour les familles de Lyapunov bifurquant d'un polygone à au plus $ 6 $ sommets, nous vérifions en outre que la torsion locale est non dégénérée, ce qui justifie de prendre la rotation du repère comme paramètre. Cet article montre la fécondité des considérations de symétrie, comme technique de démonstration mais aussi comme guide heuristique dans la recherche de solutions remarquables. Le problème des $n$ corps, depuis longtemps à l'origine de nombreuses théories mathématiques, garde entier, de part la variété des techniques nécessaires à son étude, son pouvoir de fascination...|$|R

This potential for reconfiguration is underutilized in the current modular systems, due to difficulty in understanding how to use and re-use the system components. Though modularity is considered as a sustainable measure in allied fields of architecture, industrial design etc, in the tradeshow design field {{the topic of the}} sustainable or 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 design seem to be limited to material selection, recycling or conserving energy. This study tries to make modular exhibit systems easier to use and reconfigure the components into a variety of different exhibits. This ability for reconfiguration- a material resource reduction feature- can be better understood as a sustainable choice in tradeshow exhibits. This study accomplishes this through the design of modular kits formed of components from the <b>Lacet</b> System (now a defunct modular system) and the design of multiple exhibit prototypes reconfigured from each kit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet P¯ be a {{sequence}} of length 2 n in which each element of { 1, 2,…,n} occurs twice. Let P′ be a closed curve in a closed surface S having n points of simple self-intersections, inducing a 4 -regular graph embedded in S which is 2 -face colorable. If the sequence of auto-intersections along P′ is given by P¯, we say that P′ is a 2 -face colorable solution for the Gauss code P¯ on surface S or a <b>lacet</b> for P¯ on S. In this paper we show (by using surface homology theory mod 2), that the set of lacets for P¯ on S are in 1 – 1 correspondence with the tight solutions {{of a system of}} quadratic equations over the Galois field GF(2). If S is the 2 -sphere, the projective plane or the Klein bottle, the corresponding quadratic systems are equivalent to linear ones. In consequence, algorithmic characterizations for the existence of solutions on these surfaces are available. For the two first surfaces this produces simple proofs of known results. The algorithmic characterization for the existence of solutions on the Klein bottle is new. We provide a polynomial algorithm to resolve the issue...|$|E
40|$|Almost a {{year ago}} I first learned about Open Content and Open Source, and watched the {{movements}} around these terms grow very big very fast since then. These movements are of incredible importance for anyone involved with computers or digital content, as they might {{change the way of}} treating digital content forever. For anyone related to the branch of multimedia these developments are of particular importance. I decided to learn more about Open Source and Open Content and discovered a whole new world in doing so. My love for music and my discontent of the current situation of the music industry has led to the topic of music. It is sad to know that there are so much talented musicians that might never get a chance to reach a wide audience, while others with less talent are being hyped by the media. I decided to combine Open Content and music, as it seemed to open up a lot of possibilities. The EMMA was an intensive and difficult year for me, also partly due to my still present injury (RSI). I would like to thank Martin <b>Lacet</b> (my thesis supervisor), and David Garcia (my project supervisor) for guiding me through this last half year.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the case of a}} 10 -year-old girl with generalized tortuosity and lengthening of all her major arteries-the carotid arteries, the aorta from the arcus to the bifurcation, and the iliac, femoral, splenic, hepatic, renal, and intercostal arteries. The condition appears to be a new entity. Pertinent abnormalities were as follows: gross pulsation of the arteries in the neck, telangiectasis of both cheeks, high palate, tortu-osity of all the arteries, aortic valvular insufficiency, 1 + to 2 + capillary fragility on tourniquet test (<b>lacet),</b> 1 + Wassermann reaction, 4 + cephalin flocculation, and his-tological fragmentation of the internal elastic membrane of the arteries. Syphilis, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, mucopolysaccharidosis, and defects of amino acid metabolism were ruled out and the author concludes that the condition was most probably caused by a congenital defect of the elastic tissues of the arterial system. Additional Indexing Words: Aortic valvular insufficiency Telangiectasis Arterial dysplasia TORTUOSITY of a single artery or its col-laterals has been well documented in all age groups. An entity in which there is buckling or kinking of the aortic arch, any part of the aorta, or tortuosity of only one or two major arteries has long been recognized. In 1852, Coulson ' described a patient who apparently had a tumor in the neck, which later proved to be a tortuous carotid artery. Later, in 1898, Balfour 2 also described this entity. Schneider and Felson 3 reviewed 125 cases of buckling of the innominate artery and de-scribed three cases of their own. Most of their patients were elderly women with hyper-tension, atherosclerosis, and cardiomegaly. Many other authors have described this same entity. 4 - 8 Others have reported kinking, elongation, tortuosity, or pseudocoarctation of the aortic arch or a part of the descending aorta. 9 - 18 A review of the literature indicate...|$|E
