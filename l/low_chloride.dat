40|$|ABSTRACT This is an {{investigation}} of the effects on the late after-potential of immersing frog sartorius muscles in three kinds of modified Ringer's fluid; hypertonic, <b>low</b> <b>chloride,</b> and potassium-free. The late after-potential has been attributed to the depolarizing effect of an accumulation of potassium, during a preceding train of impulses, in the intermediary space of the model of a muscle fiber proposed by Adrian and Freygang. Both the hypertonic and <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions prolonged the late after-potential reversibly and the potassium-free solution shortened it. The effect of the low potassium solution fitted those data calculated from the model, but the effect of the hypertonic and <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions required an increase in size of the intermediary space of the model in order to fit the calculated data. An electron microscopic study of the muscles showed that the size of the transverse tubular system changed reversibly in the hypertonic and <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions in almost the amount necessary to fit the experimental data to the calculated data. This agreement between the change in size of the transverse tubular system and that of the intermediary space indicates that the intermediary space may be the transverse tubular system...|$|E

40|$|Although a {{great deal}} {{has been written about}} the {{clinical}} aspects of louse-borne typhus, there have been only a few reports on the metabolic changes which occur in this disease. Among the first biochemical studies on typhus were those re-ported by Murchison (1) in 1862. He discovered that large amounts of urea frequently were present in the blood of typhus patients, and that their urine contained abnormally large amounts of ni-trogen. He attributed this to an "exaggerated disintegration of nitrogenous tissues. " Since then other physicians have postulated excessive protein destruction in association with elevated blood and urine nitrogen (2, 3). Renewed interest in this problem was aroused by recent studies '(4) which showed that azo-temia, or nitrogen retention, was a common find-ing in louse-borne typhus, and in general related to the severity of the case. In these studies it was reported that azotemia was present in every fatal case. Little is known about the general electrolyte pat-tern in typhus. Murchison (1) noted that the chlorides were greatly reduced in the urine. He believed that this was due either to an impairment of absorption of chlorides or to their absolute re-tention. Since then other investigators have re-ported <b>low</b> <b>chlorides</b> in the blood of typhus pa-tients (5). Julliard and Henaff (6) reported the serum and urine <b>chlorides</b> <b>low</b> until 1 week after defervescence.

40|$|In this work, microvia filling was {{performed}} by copper electroplating using two plating formulas with and without a leveler at a low concentration of chloride. The base plating solution contained CuSO 4, H 2 SO 4, polyethylene glycol (PEG), his (3 -sulfopropyl) disulfide (SPS) and Cl-. When the Cl- concentration was lower than 30 ppm, the plating formula without a leveler became dead for bottom-up filling, resulting in conformal deposition. The addition of I ppm Alcian Blue, used as a leveler, could effectively recover the filling performance of the plating formula with <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration. Electrochemical analyses revealed possible mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the usage of Alcian Blue can widen the operation window of chloride concentration, since it can assist PEG in competing with SPS in adsorption at <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration.

40|$|Measurement of {{transepithelial}} {{potential difference}} (PD) on the nasal mucosa {{has been proposed}} to test for defective ion transport in cystic fibrosis (CF), and its possible correction after gene therapy or other treatments. The "classical" method records nasal PD under the inferior turbinate, with the disadvantage that {{the tip of the}} electrode is not seen by the operator. We have developed a purpose-designed perfusion electrode for PD recording on the visible, medial/posterior aspect of the turbinate. We wanted to determine whether such PD recordings adequately discriminate between CF patients and normal subjects. Measurements of baseline PD and response to a standardized perfusion protocol were performed in 20 normal subjects and 12 CF patients. Solutions of amiloride, with or without <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> buffer were applied for 3 min. Increased baseline PD and depolarization after amiloride discriminated CF patients from normal subjects. Only one CF patient overlapped with the normal range. Superfusion of <b>low</b> <b>chloride</b> buffer with amiloride and terbutaline caused repolarization in 18 out of 20 normal subjects (90 %), consistent with physiological Cl- secretion process, but in none of the CF patients.

40|$|In {{neuronal}} cells, GABA evokes {{an increase}} in chloride conductance by activating GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors. In mature neurons, this increase in conductance generally has a hyperpolarizing and inhibitory action. Using gramicidin-based perforated patch recordings, we show that in cultured motor neurons GABA-induced currents are significantly altered following activation of GABA receptors coinciding with changes in membrane potential. Changes in intracellular chloride concentration constituted the mechanism for this modulation. Because of <b>low</b> resting <b>chloride</b> conductance and <b>low</b> activity of <b>chloride</b> transporters, changes in intracellular chloride concentration and hence GABA response were long-lasting (time constant of recovery was about 2. 5 min).

40|$|SummaryDietary {{potassium}} deficiency, {{common in}} modern diets, raises {{blood pressure and}} enhances salt sensitivity. Potassium homeostasis requires a molecular switch in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), which fails in familial hyperkalemic hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2), activating the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter, NCC. Here, we show that dietary potassium deficiency activates NCC, even {{in the setting of}} high salt intake, thereby causing sodium retention and a rise in blood pressure. The effect is dependent on plasma potassium, which modulates DCT cell membrane voltage and, in turn, intracellular <b>chloride.</b> <b>Low</b> intracellular <b>chloride</b> stimulates WNK kinases to activate NCC, limiting potassium losses, even at the expense of increased blood pressure. These data show that DCT cells, like adrenal cells, sense potassium via membrane voltage. In the DCT, hyperpolarization activates NCC via WNK kinases, whereas in the adrenal gland, it inhibits aldosterone secretion. These effects work in concert to maintain potassium homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) susceptibility of austenitic stainless steel (SS) {{is dominated by the}} mechanism of anodic path cracking (APC) and is enhanced by the passivity degradation. Experimental observations show that ingress of hydrogen into austenitic SSs reduces the stability of passive films and enhances the susceptibility to SCC. The hydrogen-promoted SCC is well demonstrated by lower crack initiation lifetime and higher crack propagation rate, as well as high frequency of passive breakdown at crack tip. The hydrogen-induced passivity degradation is indicated by the low breakdown potential, high passive current density, declined repassivation ability and <b>low</b> critical <b>chloride</b> concentration to induce breakdown of passive films. It is found that the action of static tensile stress in elastic deformation regime can also affect the passivity of material, as indicated by the high passive current density, low breakdown potential and <b>low</b> critical <b>chloride</b> concentration to induce breakdown of passive films. The results imply that the hydrogen-promoted SCC of austenitic SSs is likely {{to be related to the}} hydrogen-induced passivity degradation which resulted from the highly defective film structure caused by ingress of hydrogen.
