25|$|The {{number of}} {{available}} budding locations {{has a large}} effect on colony fragmentation. A large number of bud nests results in small colony fragments, indicating that the colony {{has the ability to}} control size and caste ratios. However, a minimum group size of 469 individuals appears preferred by the species. Amount of fragmentation does not have an effect on food distribution. After budding, <b>nest</b> <b>units</b> do not compete for resources, but rather act cooperatively. This is evolutionarily explained by the high amount of genetic relatedness among these <b>nest</b> <b>units.</b> In addition, major disturbances to the central nest cause the colony to abandon it and flee to a bud <b>nest.</b> Thus, <b>nest</b> <b>units</b> may exchange individuals after budding occurs, further explaining their cooperative behavior.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia to assess local egg selection practices, brooding practices, practices of breaking broodiness, techniques of egg fertility testing, and factors related with incubation. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select weredas, sample kebeles and respondents in which the three weredas were selected by purposive sampling technique. Pretested structured questionnaire and focused group discussion were employed to generate data. All generated survey {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics of SPSS 20. Broody hens were the only means of egg incubation and chick brooding. Broody hens were selected based primarily on body size, broody character, ability of defending predator and number of eggs laid from which broody character predominates the other parameters. Eggs laid at home were the predominant source of egg for incubation and selected mainly based on size, shape and season in which the egg is laid. A bamboo basket bedded with teff straw, a nest on the ground and a nest under bed were the common <b>laying</b> <b>nest</b> preparations. Farmers practiced to store eggs in either directly on the <b>laying</b> <b>nest,</b> in cold room and on the grain. The preferable season of allowing broody hen to hatch was from October to December because of better feed access, less predator and better chick survivability. Majority of the farmers practice cleaning the egg by cloth as treatment. Shaking the egg was the commonly used method of checking egg fertility. Farmers attempt to increase egg production by stimulating broody hens to resume laying through various practices from which moving to neighbors was the most common...|$|R
50|$|A female wasp of {{this species}} may take {{anywhere}} from 30 to 60 flies as food to provision each one of her nests; she makes a new nest for every egg she <b>lays.</b> <b>Nests</b> are simple burrows some 15 cm deep, with a single enlarged chamber at the bottom. An egg is laid in the empty chamber, and the female wasp brings back paralyzed flies until the chamber is full (mass provisioning), at which point she closes the nest and begins another. Numerous females often excavate nests within a small area where the soil is suitable, creating large and sometimes very dense nesting aggregations. Nearly all the prey are biting female horse-flies; exceptionally, other flies such as Odontomyia and the screw-worm fly Cochliomyia are taken.|$|R

Large numbers of adult fleas and larvae were extracted by Tullgren funnel from samples of wood shavings used as nest box material. Lower numbers were extracted from the litter under these nest boxes. A pilot trial using infested nest boxes and floor litter showed good control of adult fleas and larvae could be obtained using a. 25 % spray prepared from a permethrin water dispersable powder. In more extensive trials the following year, almost complete control of hen fleas and larvae was obtained following monthly treatments of nest boxes with a. 125 % permethrin spray or a 1 % permethrin powder.

Exploring, alone, {{deep into the}} Tarra Valley vegetation and frequently into dangerous areas where the best-unspoilt specimens were and the egg <b>laying</b> <b>nests</b> of the lyrebird could be found. Kara became one with the natural environment around her. By 1961 Kara had collected over 160 specimens which included types of toadstool and fungi. Significantly, two new types of fungi were named after her - Poria healeyi and Lambertella healeyi. Poria healeyi, which was a previously unidentified fungus causing yellow straw rot in Mountain Ash, and the second, Lambertella healeyi was a fungus growing on another fungus. Further, Kara collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found and forwarded those as well. In total over 500 specimens were collected which also included 80 species of moss. Subsequently Tarra Valley is the most thoroughly studied and recorded area in Australia at the time.|$|R

50|$|Reptiles, such as {{sea turtles}} {{spend most of}} their lives in the ocean. However, their life cycle {{requires}} the females to come on shore and <b>lay</b> their <b>nests</b> on the beach. Consequently, the hatchlings emerge from the sand and have to run toward the water. Depending on their species, sea turtles are described to have either a symmetrical gait (diagonally opposite limbs are moving together) or an asymmetrical gait (Contra-lateral limbs move together). For example, loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings are commonly seen exhibiting symmetrical gait on sand, whereas, leatherback sea turtles employ the asymmetrical gait while on land. Notably, leatherbacks employ their front (pelvic) flippers more during forward terrestrial locomotion. Sea turtles can be seen nesting on subtropical and tropical beaches all around the world and exhibit such behavior such as arribada (Collective animal behavior). This is a phenomenon seen in Kemp's Ridley turtles which emerge all at once in one night only onto the beach to <b>lay</b> their <b>nests.</b>|$|R

40|$|How age of hens, {{storage time}} of manure, {{ventilation}} rate, ventilation technique and bedding materials affect concentration and release of ammonia in a floor housing system for laying hens {{have been carried}} out at the Department of Agricultural Biosystems and Technology (JBT) research station Alnarp Södergård during two 433 and 464 days long production batches. A climate chamber was equipped with a floor housing system. The housing system contained a bedding area, a manure bin area with manure conveyors below a draining floor and <b>laying</b> <b>nests</b> that placed close to an end wall. The age of the hens had no influence on the release of ammonia. However, the age had an effect on the amount of manure stored in the bedding which influenced the release of ammonia. The investigations clearly showed that long time storage of manure in a manure bin will cause a rapid increase in ammonia concentrations. The ammonia concentration exceeded the hygienic threshold limit value of 25 ppm after about 7 days storage of manure in a manure bin...|$|R

40|$|The {{catchment}} is {{a fundamental}} unit of study in hydrology. It is normally well defined topographically, can be studied {{as a series of}} <b>nested</b> <b>units</b> (larger catchments are made of many smaller sub-catchments), and is an open system for measuring inputs and outputs of mass and energy. Catchments are usually delineated by land-surface topography and are made of hillslopes and channels. The proportion of hillslope area to channel density or total channel length may determine how efficiently water can be removed from a catchment since water in channels tends to move much more quickly than water across and through hillslopes. Thus the spatial layout of hillslopes and channels is important. This article describes some basic principles of catchment hydrology and illustrates how determining spatial factors involved is fundamental for understanding how environmental change may impact on runoff production and resulting river flow...|$|R

40|$|ConspectusMaterials {{with the}} crystal {{structure}} of γ-brass type (Cu 5 Zn 8 type) are typical representatives of intermetallic compounds. From the electronic point of view, {{they are often}} interpreted using the valence electron concentration approach of Hume–Rothery, developed previously for transition metals. The γ-brass-type phases of the main-group elements are rather rare. The intermetallic compound Be 21 Pt 5, a new member of this family, was synthesized, and its crystal structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties were characterized. Be 21 Pt 5 crystallizes in the cubic space group F 4 ̅ 3 m with lattice parameter a = 15. 90417 (3) Å and 416 atoms per unit cell. From the crystallographic point of view, the binary substance represents a special family of intermetallic compounds called complex metallic alloys (CMA). The crystal structure was solved {{by a combination of}} synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction data. Besides the large difference in the scattering power of the components, the structure solution was hampered by the systematic presence of very weak reflections mimicking wrong symmetry. The structural motif of Be 21 Pt 5 is described as a 2 × 2 × 2 superstructure of the γ-brass structure (Cu 5 Zn 8 type) or 6 × 6 × 6 superstructure of the simple bcc structural pattern with distinct distribution of defects. The main building elements of the crystal structure are four types of <b>nested</b> polyhedral <b>units</b> (clusters) with the compositions Be 22 Pt 4 and Be 20 Pt 6. Each cluster contains four shells (4 + 4 + 6 + 12 atoms). Clusters with different compositions reveal various occupation of the shells by platinum and beryllium. Polyhedral <b>nested</b> <b>units</b> with the same composition differ by the distance of the shell atoms to the cluster center. Analysis of chemical bonding was made applying the electron localizability approach, a quantum chemical technique operating in real space that is proven to be especially efficient for intermetallic compounds. Evaluations of the calculated electron density and electron localizability indicator (ELI-D) revealed multicenter bonding, being in accordance with the low valence electron count per atom in Be 21 Pt 5. A new type of atomic interactions in intermetallic compounds, cluster bonds involving 8 or even 14 atoms, is found in the clusters with shorter distances between the shell atoms and the cluster centers. In the remaining clusters, four- and five-center bonds characterize the atomic interactions. Multicluster interactions within the polyhedral <b>nested</b> <b>units</b> and three-center polar intercluster bonds result in a three-dimensional framework resembling the structural pattern of NaCl. Be 21 Pt 5 is a diamagnetic metal and one of rather rare CMA compounds revealing superconductivity (Tc = 2. 06 K) ...|$|R

Also discussed are enhanced weighting options, new in SAS/STAT 13. 1, for both the MODEL and RANDOM statements. These weighting options enable PROC GLIMMIX to handle weights at different levels. PROC GLIMMIX uses a pseudolikelihood approach to estimate parameters, and it computes robust standard error estimators.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate pens switching, closing nest boxes after egg <b>laying</b> and <b>nest</b> boxes switching inside the same pen as management procedures for controlling broodiness in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders and their role in circulating prolactin. Black bronze turkey (n. = 350) and Muscovy duck (n. = 700) were randomly selected and housed on deep litter. The results showed a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) increase in egg production in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pens switching and closing nest boxes after end of egg laying. While, there was no significant (P > 0. 05) difference in egg production in response to switching of nest boxes in turkey hens but a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) result was found in Muscovy ducks. On the other hand, there were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decreases in circulating prolactin level and broodiness in both turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pen switching, closing nest boxes after egg <b>laying</b> and <b>nest</b> boxes switching. In conclusion, application of these management procedures was associated with increased egg production while decreased expression of broodiness (incubation behaviour) and circulating prolactin in turkey hens and Muscovy ducks...|$|R
