40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Strength {{research}} is always {{one of the}} study focuses of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> is still not constructed due to complex face gear teeth. Thus, in this study, an equivalent face gear tooth is proposed by assessment of geometric characteristics of face gear teeth and tooth contact analysis, and a strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> {{which is based on}} ISO 6336 standard associated with the proposed equivalent face gear teeth, is constructed. The fidelity of the proposed strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is verified by comparing its results with the benchmark of results by finite element methods. Furthermore, the impact of geometric parameters on the strength of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is investigated, and some design suggestions are extracted.

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, design solutions of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> without <b>gear</b> tooth modifications {{are not to}} be constructed. Thus, in this study, a design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with micro-punch webs is proposed. A calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs is constructed, an example case of a micro-punch web for a low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> is calculated, which is based on the proposed calculation procession, and the noise elimination effect of the example case is predicted. Meanwhile, the impacts of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs on sound resonant frequencies are discussed. Furthermore, an experiment of the example case is conducted to check the effect of micro-punch webs on noise reductions and the proposed calculation procession and design solution. The experimental results indicate that the noise reductions of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accomplished by micro-punch webs under the almost same dynamic response conditions, and the fidelity of the proposed calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs and design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accepted.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} capacity of the <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> {{can be achieved by}} changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R

The geometric modelling method for involute worm gears allows the tooth elastic deformation and tooth root stresses of worm <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> under different load conditions to be investigated. On the basis of finite element analysis, the instantaneous meshing stiffness and loaded transmission errors are obtained and the load share is predicted.

The {{results show that the}} efficiency of harmonic <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> increases with the output torque increased, and it has no relation with input rotational speed. When the output shaft takes the value of rated torque (Tout= 450 Nm), the transmission efficiency of harmonic <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> obtained by the finite element numerical simulation is 87. 1 %. This value of transmission efficiency is quite close to the type of XB 1 - 120 - 100 harmonic drive efficiency (75 %- 90 %).
