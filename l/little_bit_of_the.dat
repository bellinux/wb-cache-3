Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is – they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways {{to make a difference in}} some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn's final impulse.|$|E

Meanwhile, Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times wrote in her review of the song that [...] "in the grander scheme of x, 'Photograph' doesn't quite seem to line up lyrically", and noted {{that most of the}} album's songs explored [...] "the feelings of a lover scorned, cheating exes and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excess life".

500|$|After his {{military}} service, Escobar confronted problems {{to meet the}} bantamweight's limit and retired. He became a spokesman for a liquor brand and relocated to New York temporally, with his family. Subsequently he returned to Puerto Rico where he worked selling liquor in bars. In May 1947, Escobar and Jiménez Sicardó co-promoted a fight {{with the intention of}} bringing fans back to boxing. In the main event, Diego Sosa was matched against Francisco Colón García. Escobar was inducted into the Madison Square Garden's Boxing Hall of Fame in 1950. Escobar continued in his job as a liquor salesperson, during which it was common for liquor salesmen to drink a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product which they sold in front of potential customers. [...] This contributed to the development of Escobar's alcoholic tendencies. His alcoholism would later combine with his diabetes and contribute to his death when he was 66 years old.

500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But {{at the same time it}} marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so I think, he can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E

Critical response to MacFarlane's performance was mixed.

[...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did [...] "impressively better than one would have wagered."
