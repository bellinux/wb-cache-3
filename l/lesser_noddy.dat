50|$|The island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds {{of seven}} species. A large colony, {{dominated}} by <b>lesser</b> <b>noddies,</b> but including about 1300 pairs of brown noddies, is present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of wedge-tailed shearwaters. Year-round breeders include white and bridled terns, white-tailed tropicbirds and some 1000-1,500 pairs of Audubon's shearwaters. Several hundred great and lesser frigatebirds use {{the island for}} roosting and can be seen soaring over it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the ruddy turnstone. Common moorhens and striated herons also breed on the island.|$|R
5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and <b>lesser</b> <b>noddies</b> build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{tropical}} waters, {{productivity is}} low and seabirds only feed at the surface, often in association with sub-surface predators. We studied the distribution and abundance of seabirds in the coastal marine environment around Réunion Island, SW Indian Ocean, between February 2001 and October 2002. We investigated the distribution and abundance of birds at sea {{with respect to the}} effects of natural factors, such as bathymetry, distance to the shore, season and associations with subsurface predatory schools, and the presence of anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs). A total of 13572 birds of 15 species were observed, 8 of which were rare. Among the 7 abundant species, <b>lesser</b> <b>noddies</b> appeared to favour the shelf area. Barau's petrels and sooty terns were more abundant offshore, and wedge-tailed shearwaters, Audubon's shearwaters, white-tailed tropicbirds and brown noddies were present over all habitats. When foraging, most species searched for prey solitarily or in very small groups. When feeding, they were generally in large multi-species flocks, especially when feeding events occurred in association with sub-surface predatory schools. Associations with surfacefeeding schools of tunas, mainly skipjack, increased the abundance of most seabird species that fed on small fish or squids. The notable exception was for the white-tailed tropicbird, which was rarely found in association with sub-surface predators and, when associated, preferentially selected dolphin pods rather than tuna schools. Although they were often associated with tuna schools, <b>lesser</b> <b>noddies</b> were also strongly concentrated on the shelf, feeding on small pelagic schools. While the aggregating power of FADs on pelagic fish has previously been demonstrated, the associations between schools of sub-surface predators and seabirds were not more frequent close to FADs. However, 2 seabird species were more abundant close to FADs when feeding, and 1 when foraging, suggesting that they may occasionally take advantage of the attractive power of FADs. Seasonal variations in the occurrence of associations indicated a turn-over of fish species that induced variations {{in the nature of the}} associations, with the greatest aggregating power of dolphin fish in spring during their peak of abundance in the vicinity of the islan...|$|R

50|$|Île aux Cocos ("Cocos Island") is a {{small island}} lying west of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a nature reserve known for its seabird colonies, {{including}} the noddy, <b>lesser</b> <b>noddy</b> and fairy tern.|$|E
50|$|Five {{species are}} {{considered}} to be breeding in internationally significant numbers: the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata); the brown and <b>lesser</b> <b>noddy</b> (Anous stolidus and Anous tenuirostris); the red-footed booby (Sula sula) and the wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus).|$|E
25|$|Seabird {{species such}} as the <b>lesser</b> frigatebird, brown <b>noddy</b> and sooty tern use the island for nesting and roosting. The island is also {{believed}} to be a rest stop for arctic-breeding shorebirds.|$|R
50|$|Migratory waders {{recorded}} in the islands include some regular visitors as well as vagrants. None breeds there. However, North Keeling is important for breeding seabirds, with sizeable numbers of red-footed boobies, great and <b>lesser</b> frigatebirds, common <b>noddies</b> and white terns. Other breeding seabirds include wedge-tailed shearwaters, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbirds, and sooty terns. It {{is possible that the}} herald petrel breeds there as well.|$|R
40|$|White Terns Gygis alba breed {{throughout}} the year on Aride Island but show a marked preference to nest during the northwest monsoon (November-March), when interspecific competition and also marine productivity {{are considered to be}} lower. In this study we investigated and compared breeding and foraging parameters of White Terns between the northwest and southeast (May-September) monsoons to assess whether interspecific competition affected foraging activity and explained the timing of breeding of White Terns. Goatfish (Mullidae) dominated the diet of White Terns and {{no significant differences were found}} in diet composition between the northwest and southeast monsoons. Similar diets and patterns of food provisioning of White Terns between the two monsoons do not support the hypothesis of strong exploitation competition during the southeast monsoon. On the other hand, foraging behaviour and frequency of capture attempts of White Terns differed between the two monsoons. The percentages of multi-species flocks with White Terns and of large flocks with more than 25 noddies Anous and terns Onychoprion were significantly higher during the southeast monsoon. Moreover, capture attempt frequencies of White Terns foraging in multi-species flocks were lower than those of solitary individuals, and both solitary and flocking White Terns had significantly lower capture attempt frequencies during the southeast monsoon in comparison with the northwest monsoon. These results suggest that interference competition depresses foraging activity of flock-foraging White Terns, particularly during the southeast monsoon, which could potentially explain why White Terns breed preferentially during the northwest monsoon. However, and despite avoiding interference competition, White Terns nesting during the northwest monsoon did not show higher breeding success than those nesting during the southeast monsoon. Other hypotheses that might explain the preference of White Terns for breeding during the northwest monsoon, such as avoidance of agonistic interactions with <b>Lesser</b> <b>Noddies</b> Anous tenuirostris at nest sites, should also be investigated...|$|R
