5000|$|Polish {{notation}} (PN), {{also known}} as normal Polish notation (NPN), <b>Łukasiewicz</b> <b>notation,</b> Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation or simply prefix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators precede their operands, in contrast to reverse Polish notation (RPN) in which operators follow their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description [...] "Polish" [...] refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.|$|E
50|$|This {{notation}} is {{the root}} of the idea of the recursive stack, a last-in, first-out computer memory store proposed by several researchers including Turing, Bauer and Hamblin, and first implemented in 1957. In 1960, <b>Łukasiewicz</b> <b>notation</b> concepts and stacks were used as the basis of the Burroughs B5000 computer designed by Robert S. Barton and his team at Burroughs Corporation in Pasadena, California. The concepts also led to the design of the English Electric multi-programmed KDF9 computer system of 1963, which had two such hardware register stacks. A similar concept underlies the reverse Polish notation (RPN, a postfix notation) of the Friden EC-130 calculator and its successors, many Hewlett Packard calculators, the Forth programming language, or the PostScript page description language.|$|E
5000|$|The table below {{shows the}} core of Jan <b>Łukasiewicz's</b> <b>{{notation}}</b> for sentential logic. [...] Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in Polish, as shown: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{corresponding}} logical {{symbols are}} [...] "↔", [...] "", and [...] "≡", and sometimes [...] "iff". These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of mathematical logic (particularly those on first-order logic, rather than propositional logic) {{make a distinction}} between these, in which the first, ↔, is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while ⇔ is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in metalogic). In <b>Łukasiewicz's</b> <b>notation,</b> it is the prefix symbol 'E'.|$|R
5000|$|And {{is usually}} denoted by an infix operator: in {{mathematics}} and logic, [...] or in electronics, and in programming languages, '''''', '''''', or ''''''. In Jan <b>Łukasiewicz's</b> prefix <b>notation</b> for logic, the operator is K, for Polish koniunkcja.|$|R
50|$|Or {{is usually}} {{expressed}} with an infix operator: {{in mathematics and}} logic, ∨; in electronics, +; and in most programming languages, |, ||, or or. In Jan <b>Łukasiewicz's</b> prefix <b>notation</b> for logic, the operator is A, for Polish alternatywa (English: alternative).|$|R
