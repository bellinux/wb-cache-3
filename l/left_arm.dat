5|$|Macartney was {{selected}} to make his debut against England in the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He {{was viewed as a}} utility player, selected for the flexibility in his batting position and his <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> orthodox spin.|$|E
5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps. England made three changes.

5|$|Davidson {{originally}} bowled <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> unorthodox spin, {{but when}} his uncle's team was missing a fast bowler in a country match, Davidson stepped in, remaining a fast bowler permanently. In 1948–49, he moved to Sydney and joined the Northern Districts grade club. A talented rugby league player in his youth, he trained with the Western Districts Football Club in the off season to maintain his fitness.|$|E

5|$|When Australia batted, Tallon {{came in at}} 6/338 to {{accompany}} Lindsay Hassett and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> orthodox spin of Jack Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of playYoung delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs with Australia using leg theory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{victim was}} customer Jeff Schaffart, 34, who was treated and released at UNMC for {{a gunshot wound}} to the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and the little finger of his left hand.

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his <b>left</b> <b>arm.</b> The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. On the other hand, England made three changes; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> orthodox of Young, all rounder Coxon made his Test debut {{in place of}} Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5. batsman. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman, who gambled on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E
60|$|The yellow {{men were}} armed with two swords, {{and a short}} javelin was slung {{across the back of}} each, while from their <b>left</b> <b>arms</b> hung cuplike shields no larger than a dinner plate, the concave sides of which turned outward toward an antagonist.|$|R
