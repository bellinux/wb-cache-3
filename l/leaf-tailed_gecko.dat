50|$|Saltuarius is a genus {{of larger}} Australian geckos, known collectively as <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos.</b> The genus {{was created in}} 1993 to {{accommodate}} {{former members of the}} genus Phyllurus. These geckos appear very similar to the Uroplatus geckos native to Madagascar. However, this is a convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The reptile and {{amphibian}} diversity at Marojejy is also rich, {{higher than}} any other protected area in Madagascar. A total of 148 species have been inventoried, and 17 of these are found only in Marojejy, including Brookesia karchei and Chamaeleo peyrieresi, two species of several chameleons found there. The panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> (genus Uroplatus), and many species of frogs are also reported from this locality. Invertebrates include large millipedes, spiders, and an abundance of small leeches.|$|R
50|$|Female {{southern}} <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> usually lay {{one or two}} soft-shelled eggs in late spring. These {{eggs are}} up to 28 mm in length. The eggs are buried in moist soil or leaf litter to prevent their drying out. Left to develop unattended, 3 months later the offspring hatch and begin fending for themselves, catching insects within {{only a few days}} of birth. They take up to two years to fully mature and then can survive for up to eight more years.|$|R

Two species of snake Cacophis scanloni and C. sheai were recently described and are believed to be endemic to the Eungella area. The recently discovered orange-sided rainforest skink (Sphenomorphus luteilateralis) is endemic to the area, and is restricted to upland rainforest above 900m in moist areas which contain rotting logs and palm fronds. The skink species Lampropholis basiliscus reaches its southern limit at Eungella.|$|R

40|$|<b>Leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> are a {{distinctive}} group of carphodactyline geckos of rainforests and rocky habitats of eastern Australia. Three genera are recognized: Phyllurus (9 species), Saltuarius (6 species) and Orraya (1 species). <b>Leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> {{have been the}} subject of much survey and taxonomic work because they are large, impressive geckos and generally have highly localized distributions. The six species comprising Saltuarius are distributed in rock outcrops and rainforests along the ranges from northern New South Wales to the Wet Tropics region of north-east Queensland. Here we report the discovery of a new Saltuarius species at Cape Melville, a rainforest outlier on Cape York Peninsula in north-east Queensland. The new species is assigned to Saltuarius based on morphological and genetic data. Saltuarius eximius sp. nov. is highly dis-tinct from all congeners in many aspects of morphology. It has a very long slender form, with relatively longer limbs, lon-ger body, narrower body and narrower neck than all congeners. It also has a highly distinct head that is relatively smaller than that of all other Saltuarius, with very large eyes that are grey rather than patterned. The tail is large but with a rela-tively short attenuated tip. Saltuarius eximius sp. nov. appears to be highly localized to upland rainforest associated with boulder habitat in the Cape Melville Range. The unusual elongate form and large eyes of S. eximius sp. nov. likely reflect adaptation to deep boulder habitat. Two other new vertebrate species (a skink and a frog) were discovered in the rainfores...|$|R

The first camp, Camp Mantella, is 4.5 km further along the path. The camp is in the lowland rain forest above the Manantenina River at an elevation of 450 m.

40|$|Extract] Australia's rain{{forests and}} {{adjoining}} moist sclerophyll forests and heaths {{are well known}} for their high diversity and for many species confined to either single localities, or very narrow ranges. <b>Leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> from such forests well illustrate these characteristics. For nearly 200 years of discovery and description of Australia's reptiles, only two species of 'leaf-tails', Phyllurus platurus (Shaw, 1790) and P. cornutus (Ogilby, 1892) = Saltuarius cornutus (Ogilby, 1892), were known. Morphological studies since 1975 {{have resulted in the}} recognition of many new species and the genus Saltuarius Couper, Covacevich & Moritz, 1993 - P. caudiannulatus Covacevich, 1975; P. isis Couper, Covacevich & Moritz, 1993; P. nepthys Couper, Covacevich & Moritz, 1993; P. ossa Couper, Covacevich & Moritz, 1993; S. salebrosus (Covacevich, 1975); Saltuarius occultus Couper, Covacevich &Moritz, 1993 and S. swaini (Wells & Wellington, 1985). Eight of the 12 presently known species have narrow distributions with four confined to single localities...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{expectation of}} vicariance biogeography is for contemporary cladogenesis to produce spatial congruence between speciating sympatric clades. The Uroplatus <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>geckos</b> represent one of most spectacular reptile radiations endemic to the continental island of Madagascar, and thus {{serve as an}} excellent group for examining patterns of continental speciation within this large and comparatively isolated tropical system. Here we present the first phylogeny that includes complete taxonomic sampling for the group, {{and is based on}} morphology and molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) data. This study includes all described species, and we also include data for eight new species. We find novel outgroup relationships for Uroplatus and find strongest support for Paroedura as its sister taxon. Uroplatus is estimated to have initially diverged during the mid-Tertiary in Madagascar, and includes two major speciose radiations exhibiting extensive spatial overlap and estimated contemporary periods of speciation. All sister species are either allopatric or parapatric. However, we found no evidence for biogeographic congruence between these sympatric clades, and dispersal events are prevalent in the dispersal–vicariance biogeographic analyses, which we estimate to date to the Miocene. One sister-species pair exhibits isolated distributions that we interpret as biogeographic relicts, and two sister-species pairs have parapatric distributions separated by elevation. Integrating ecological niche models with our phylogenetic results finds both conserved and divergent niches between sister species. We also found substantial intra-specific genetic variation, and for the three most widespread species, poor intra-specific predictive performance for ecological niche models across the latitudinal span of Madagascar. These latter results indicate the potential for intra-specific niche specialization along environmental gradients, and more generally, this study suggests a complex speciation history for this group in Madagascar, which appears to include multiple speciation processes...|$|R

50|$|The {{survival}} of the satanic <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is intrinsically linked to {{the continued existence of}} its Madagascan rainforest habitat. Protected areas are therefore essential, and at present the satanic <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is known to occur in at least three: Tsaratanana Strict Nature Reserve, Marojejy National Park or Anjanaharibe Special Reserve. However, illegal harvesting of leaf-tailed geckos is known to occur even within protected areas, and efforts to control this threatening activity are required if this extraordinary and unique reptile is to endure. This gecko is not a prey of birds, as commonly thought.|$|E
50|$|A nocturnal reptile, with {{suitably}} large eyes, the <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> moves {{about its}} rainforest habitat at night feeding on insects.

The <b>leaf-tailed</b> <b>gecko</b> is somewhat of an expert at avoiding predators, not only through their incredible mimicry, but {{through a number of}} behaviours. They can flatten their body against the substrate to reduce the body’s shadow, open their jaws wide to show a frightening, bright red mouth, and voluntarily shed their tail in order to trick a predator.|$|E
