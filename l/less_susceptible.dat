40|$|Demand {{for organic}} {{products}} is intensified {{in many countries}} each year. Following this trend, Brazil produces increasing volumes of organic grape juice. In this way, a survey of organic grape juices made from grapes produced according to this system was carried out where physicochemical composition, minerals, trace elements, and pesticide residues were determined. Variables related to grape juice composition were performed by physicochemical procedures; minerals and trace elements, by inductively plasma optical emission spectrometry; pesticide residues, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Main {{results show that the}} physicochemical composition of organic grape juices was in general in accordance to the Brazilian legislation. The mean concentrations of trace elements were very low, varying from 0. 002 (Cd) to 0. 970 (Ba) mg L– 1. Pesticide residues were not detected in any sample analyzed (MRL= 10 µg L– 1). These results show that the Serra Gaúcha viticultural region present conditions to produce organic grape juices, despite the adverse climate factors that occurs in some years. Nevertheless, these products should be made with grape varieties, such as the labrusca ones, <b>less</b> <b>susceptibles</b> to the main grapevine pathogens...|$|R

It was found that CAM with CDWA frequently achieved higher stiffness than control mixes using natural aggregate (NA), but that they required significantly higher bitumen and water contents. They were <b>less</b> temperature <b>susceptible,</b> therefore potentially more fatigue resistant, but more complicated to design.

30|$|This {{study showed}} that iron {{complexed}} by humic acids can be displaced and solubilized {{by the action of}} microbially produced siderophores or root-exuded organic acids. The major drive for the iron removal from the iron complexes is attributed to the stability constants with the new ligands, which are larger than those between iron and the humic acids. However, the extent of Fe displacement was also dependent on both the molecular composition and consequent conformational flexibility of humic materials and the steric hindrance of ligands. Complexes made by humic acids rich in aromatic carbon were <b>less</b> potentially <b>susceptible</b> to release iron to organic ligands present in the soil solution than complexes formed with alkyl-rich humic acids. In fact, the highly aromatic humic acids are liable to be more conformationally rigid and inhibit the accessibility of the bulky siderophore molecules to the iron-complexing sites.|$|R

50|$|The complex {{calculations}} treating wakefield-related beam stability for the TM01 mode in accelerators {{show that}} there are specific regions of phase between the beam bunches and the driven RF mode that allow stable operation at the highest possible beam currents.

These studies suggest a revision of streptococcal and Staphylococcus sp. interpretive guidelines to criteria (greater {{than or equal to}} 23 mm = <b>susceptible,</b> <b>less</b> than or equal to 13 mm = resistant) that are more compatible with in vivo erythromycin concentrations. It is also recommended that zone diameters be modified for H. influenzae (greater than or equal to 23 mm = <b>susceptible,</b> <b>less</b> than 22 mm = resistant) and that meningococci not be tested. A wide moderately susceptible category (1. 0 to 4. 0 micrograms/ml) would primarily include enterococcus strains and those organisms that would then respond only to parenteral administration of erythromycin. Roxithromycin (RU 965 or RU 28965), a new oxime ether erythromycin derivative, was also evaluated by investigator-prepared 15 -micrograms disks and later with 30 - and 60 -micrograms commercial disks. Although roxithromycin was comparable to erythromycin in activity and regression line statistics, changes in the susceptible disk criteria were necessary because of superior roxithromycin serum concentrations and a longer serum half-life. Preliminary susceptible breakpoint criteria were greater than 21 mm = susceptible, 10 to 20 mm = indeterminate, and {{less than or equal to}} 9 mm = resistant.

Our genome-wise prediction analysis revealed that approximately 12 % of T. cruzi genes possibly encode GPI-anchored proteins. By analyzing the GPIome of T. cruzi insect-dwelling epimastigote stage using LC-MS(n), we identified 90 GPI species, of which 79 were novel. Moreover, we determined that mucins coded by the T. cruzi small mucin-like gene (TcSMUG S) family are the major GPI-anchored proteins expressed on the epimastigote cell surface. TcSMUG S mucin mature sequences are short (56 - 85 amino acids) and highly O-glycosylated, and contain few proteolytic sites, therefore, <b>less</b> likely <b>susceptible</b> to proteases of the midgut of the insect vector.

5|$|Following {{the reign}} of the Han dynasty, (202 BC–220 AD), the idea of the Buddhist stupa entered Chinese culture, as a means to house and protect scriptural sutras. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the {{distinctive}} Chinese pagoda was developed, its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the Han dynasty (as inferred from models in Han-era tombs). During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) periods, Chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick, which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> to decay. The earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the Songyue Pagoda, built in 523, and a typical example of a Tang-era stone pagoda is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, constructed in 652. Although Buddhist influences on China waned after the late Tang period, numerous Buddhist pagoda towers were built during the Song dynasty. Tall Chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city's walls, largely to avoid competition with the cosmic-imperial authority embodied in the cities' drum- and gate-towers. The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in a city ward of what was southeastern Chang'an, is among the exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were <b>less</b> <b>susceptible</b> to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E

In order to quantify this double effect an inquiry among farmers in central Belgium {{was set up to}} find out which fields are preferably taken out of production. A statistical analysis pointed out that fields with a weak slope gradient, a loamy topsoil and good soil drainage have a low probability of being taken out of production. The results of the questionnaire were used to construct a transition probability map representing for each field the probability that it will be taken out of production. These transition probabilities were used to simulate the decrease in regional erosion risk for different scenarios.
