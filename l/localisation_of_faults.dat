40|$|Abstract—The <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> in {{integrated}} circuits is a challenging problem and a dominating {{factor in the}} overall verification effort. Electrical bugs, in particular, surface only in the fabricated prototypes, leading to behaviour deviating from the golden model. Limited observability complicates their localisation: Logging mechanisms such as trace buffers allow us to retain only a limited execution history. A symbolic analysis of the RTL design can find discrepancies between the values recorded in the trace buffer and the intended behaviour. Contemporary MAX-SAT solvers are then able to identify a maximal subset of the RTL design {{that is consistent with}} the observed behaviour. The elements in the complement of this subset represent potential locations of the fault. The scalability of contemporary decision procedures dictates the size of a window of execution cycles which we can analyse using symbolic techniques. Current MAX-SAT-based fault localisation techniques require this window to span the fault as well as the error it causes. To address the scalability issues resulting from large window sizes, we propose to slide a smaller window along the temporal axis, constraining it with the information recorded in the trace buffer for the respective execution cycles. In this scenario, the localisation attempt may fail: The limited information provided by the trace buffer may be insufficient to pin down the exact temporal and spatial location of the fault. We propose to use backbones to identify information that can be propagated across sliding windows. The backbone of a symbolic representation of a circuit is the set of signals that are immutable under the given constraints (e. g., the output and trace buffer values). This additional information has several benefits: Firstly, it may be instrumental in locating the fault. Secondly, it may enable a reduction {{of the size of the}} of trace buffers and the sliding window. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the use of backbones allows us to reduce the size of the sliding windows or the trace buffer. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, {{different}} proposed methods for detecting and locating short circuit faults in Multi Terminal HVDC grids {{have been evaluated}} by implemenation and transient simulations in PSCAD. The research has been limited to cable based systems. HVDC grids have seen increasing interest in recent years, but {{have yet to be}} fully realised. Suitable converter technology was introduced in 1997 and has been further developed since, while switches able to interrupt large DC currents were introduced in June 2013. One of the major issues left is fault localisation. Due to the low impedance in HVDC cable systems, fault currents rise to severe magnitudes system wide in {{a matter of a few}} milliseconds. This may cause damage to the converter diodes if not dealt with quickly. In order to obtain a better understanding of the fault propagation, research into the subject is presented. It is found that the capacitors in the converters is a main source of large fault currents, and fast fault detection is essential for protection of converter components. Time between first detection of fault until current interruption should be within a few milliseconds. Different methods have been proposed for <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> in recent years. These are presented together with traditional fault localisation methods, and briefly discussed with the intent of deciding which to implement and evaluate in PSCAD. Protection based on current derivative and wavelet transformation, as well as travelling wave protection is chosen and implemented in a three converter VSC system. Different fault types are applied at various locations with varying system capacitance and up to 16 $Omega$ fault impedance. The results indicate that none of the three methods are able to detect and locate all impedance faults on their own. The travelling wave protection is suitable for short lines, but fails when exposed to high fault impedances and distances. By using derivative polarity to determine direction of fault and wavelet magnitude to determine distance, faults are successfully located in a high capacitance system within a respectable time. It is concluded that all the three tested methods should be considered for implementation when designing a future HVDC protection system. </p...|$|E

The technical feasibility of optically-based DC current measurements is evaluated through laboratory experiments using commercially available equipment. Simulation-based analysis through Matlab/Simulink® has been adopted to test the proposed fault location algorithm under different fault types and locations along a DC grid.

40|$|We {{have used}} Bouguer gravity anomaly and {{topography}} data {{to determine the}} equivalent elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te {{in the region of}} the India-Eurasia collisional system. Comparison of observed and modelled gravity anomalies along 1 -dimensional profiles suggest there are significant variations in Te along-strike of the Himalaya foreland. Estimates decrease from a high of 70 km in the central region to 30 - 50 km in the east and west. We have verified these inferences of spatial variations using a 2 -dimensional, non-spectral, interative flexure and gravity anomaly modelling technique. The Himalaya foreland forms a high Te (40 < Te < 100 km) rigid block with a well defined edge, as shown by the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> and deformation along its northern margin. Other high Te blocks occur to the north beneath the Qaidam and Sichuan basins. The Tibetan plateau forms a low Te (0 < Te < 20 km) weak region that extends from {{the central part of the}} plateau into south-western China. Tectonic styles in the India-Eurasia collisional system therefore involve both 'rigid' and 'non-rigid' blocks. Where high Te rigid blocks are present the styles dominated by underthrusting of the more rigid block. Where the collisional zone is not constrained by rigid blocks, however, the style appears to be dominated by lower crustal flow and a more continuous style of deformation. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Detection Algorithm for the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> unknown <b>fault</b> lines <b>of</b> {{a surface}} from {{scattered}} data is given. The method {{is based on}} a local approximation scheme using thin plate splines, and we show that this yields approximation of second order accuracy instead of first order as in the global case.

The output of our method provides polygonal curves which can be used for the purpose of constrained surface approximation. 1 Introduction Feature recognition has become an attractive field for research especially within industrial applications. A feature of a surface f : R 2 ! R typically reflects characteristic properties of f, such as discontinuities across planar curves. In geophysical sciences these discontinuities are referred to as fault lines [1], [20], [9]. The motivation for this work is given by applications from oil industry where method [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} probing-approach to distributed fault-detection in networked systems, based on autonomous configuration of algorithm parameters. Statistical modelling {{is used for}} detection and <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> network <b>faults.</b> A detected fault is isolated to a node or link by collaborative fault-localisation. From local measurements obtained through probing between nodes, probe response delay and packet drop are modelled via parameter estimation for each link. Estimated model parameters are used for autonomous configuration of algorithm parameters, related to probe intervals and detection mechanisms. Expected fault-detection performance is formulated as a cost instead of specific parameter values, significantly reducing configuration efforts in a distributed system. The benefit offered by using our algorithm is fault-detection with increased certainty based on local measurements, compared to other methods not taking observed network conditions into account. We investigate the algorithm performance for varying user parameters and failure conditions. The simulation results indicate that more than 95 % <b>of</b> the generated <b>faults</b> can be detected with few false alarms. At least 80 % <b>of</b> the link <b>faults</b> and 65 % <b>of</b> the node <b>faults</b> are correctly localised. The performance can be improved by parameter adjustments and by using alternative paths for communication of algorithm control messages. CNS 4 WARDprobma...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterisation}} of seismic sources with time-reversed wave fields {{is developing}} into a standard technique {{that has already}} been successful in numerous applications. While the time-reversal imaging of effective point sources is now well-understood, little work has been done to extend this technique to the study of finite rupture processes. This is despite the pronounced non-uniqueness in classic finite source inversions. The need to better constrain the details of finite rupture processes motivates the series of synthetic and real-data time reversal experiments described in this paper. We address questions concerning the quality of focussing in the source area, the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> plane, the estimation of the slip distribution and the source complexity up to which time-reversal imaging can be applied successfully. The frequency band for the synthetic experiments is chosen such that it is comparable to the band usually employed for finite source inversion. Contrary to our expectations, we find that time-reversal imaging is useful only for effective point sources, where it yields good estimates of both the source location and the origin time. In the case of finite sources, however, the time-reversed field does not provide meaningful characterisations <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> location and the rupture process. This result cannot be improved sufficiently with the help of different imaging fields, realistic modifications of the receiver geometry or weights applied to the time-reversed sources. The reasons for this failure are manifold. They include the choice of the frequency band, the incomplete recording of wave field information at the surface, the excitation of large-amplitude surface waves that deteriorate the depth resolution, the absence of a sink that should absorb energy radiated during the later stages of the rupture process, the invisibility of small slip and the neglect of prior information concerning the fault geometry and the inherent smoothness of seismologically inferred Earth models that prevents the beneficial occurrence of strong multiple-scattering. The condensed conclusion of our study is that the limitations of time-reversal imaging – at least in the frequency band considered here – start where the seismic source stops being effectively point-localised...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} the influence of culture difference on the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> multinational enterprise based on the case of Satatools in China. In order to achieve the research aim, questionnaire was used to investigate the culture confliction between foreign managers and Chinese local staffs during the process <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China. Semi-structured interview was used to investigate the influence of culture difference on the <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China. This research has yielded the following conclusions: First, from questionnaire, it could be known that Satatools implemented localisation strategy in production & purchase, marketing, human resources and R&D. Comparatively, human resources <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools is still conservative. The senior managers of Satatools in China still compose of staffs assigned by parent company. The barriers and challenges of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> strategy <b>of</b> Satatools in China’s market are cultural difference between China and American staffs, inadaptable management and leadership of American company for Chinese staffs and value differences between Chinese and American managers. Second, it is found from interview that comprehensive implementation <b>of</b> <b>localisation</b> strategy <b>of</b> Satatools in China includes production & purchase localisation, marketing localisation, human resources localisation and R&D <b>localisation.</b> The <b>localisation</b> <b>of</b> Satatools in China is a gradual process, including production & purchase localisation at first, then marketing localisation and human resources localisation, and finally R&D localisation. Third, it is further found from interview that Satatools usually encounters barriers of cultural difference and confliction during localisation in China. Cultural differences increase difficulties of staff management with poor cohesion of staffs, innovation & change and decision-making. Moreover, cultural differences increase training costs of staffs and difficulties of R&D & design of products. Finally, this dissertation proposed some recommendations for enterprise in China to carry out the localisation strategy...|$|R
