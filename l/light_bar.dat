5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a <b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> signals health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Red is {{the most}} used color on Japanese {{emergency}} vehicles. The Japanese police uses <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> mounted on a raised (mechanical) platform {{to make them more}} visible over congested streets. Rotating lights are most commonly used. But some newer vehicles have LED <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> installed. Vehicles with any other light color than red are security or engineers. Wig-wag headlights are not used.|$|R
40|$|Responses of area- 17 neurons to <b>light</b> {{and dark}} <b>bars</b> moving {{over a wide}} range of speeds were {{measured}} over a range of receptive-field locations in anesthetized and paralyzed cats. For both <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and dark bars, velocity sensitivity shifted to higher speeds with increasing eccentricity, whereas response strength and direction selectivity hardly changed. The good correlation between response strength and velocity sensitivity for <b>light</b> and dark <b>bars</b> suggests that ON and OFF inputs converge upon most area- 17 cells. The correlation between direction selectivities for <b>light</b> and dark <b>bars</b> was not better than that between velocity sensitivities for <b>light</b> and dark <b>bars.</b> Only cells with strong direction selectivity were equally direction selective for <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> and dark bars. Comparison with previous studies done with high-contrast stimuli shows that the shift in sensitivity to higher speeds with increasing eccentricity is contrast dependent. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Police {{used to have}} blue-colored {{emergency}} lights {{but after}} a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles {{in case of an}} emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the newly}} {{introduced}} convertible {{version of the}} C5 was chosen to pace the Indianapolis 500 race, and a Pace Car Replica (RPO Z4Z) was offered to the public. Aside from lacking the equipment necessary for actual pace car duties (<b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> special racing harnesses, etc.), there was little difference between the Pace Car Replica C5 and the vehicle that actually saw duty during the race. The Pace Car Replica package consisted of a special paint color ("Radar Blue"), unique interior colors (black and yellow), painted yellow wheels, and special pace car decals. The Pace Car Replica package also included other optional equipment: the newly introduced Active Handling System (RPO JL4); an electronically tuned AM/FM radio with CD player and a Bose speaker system; an electronic dual-zone heating & air conditioning system; and leather adjustable sport bucket seats. While regarded {{by many as the}} most garish Corvette appearance package offered to date, the 1998 Pace Car Replicas nevertheless enjoy a strong and loyal following of owners and collectors.|$|E

25|$|The {{color of}} {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is blue. Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have {{right of way}} over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the blood bank and some lifeguard organizations. Dutch police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are STOP POLITIE (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or VOLGEN POLITIE (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the <b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign {{on the front of}} the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words ‘Ambulance’ and ‘Spoed’ (‘urgent’). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for an other reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.|$|E
25|$|Wolverhampton has {{a number}} of live music venues; the largest {{occasionally}} used being the football ground, Molineux Stadium, which was used for a Bon Jovi concert in 2003, but the biggest indoor venue regularly used is Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with a standing capacity of 3,000. Second to that is Wulfrun Hall (part of the same complex as the Civic Hall, which is owned and operated by the City Council) which has a standing capacity of just over 1,100. The Civic Halls complex also has a newer venue, The Slade Rooms (named after the 1970s rock band), which has a capacity of approximately 550 standing. There are also a number of smaller venues with capacities of between 100 and 250, although the longest-established of these, the Wolverhampton Varsity, is now closed, as is the Little Civic. Other venues include the <b>Light</b> <b>Bar</b> in Fryer Street, the 'Numa Bar' and the Dog & Doublet (next to the old Little Civic), although the situation in this area of entertainment remains fluid. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company, and Wolf Town DIY, an independent record label that primarily releases punk and alternative music by underground artists. The Midland Box Office is the primary sales point for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is manned by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front <b>light</b> <b>bar,</b> wrap-around rear glass and skirted rear fender, {{in favor of a}} design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally aspirated engine, but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups.

500|$|The player-character is a multicolored serpent {{creature}} {{called the}} [...] "Long Mover" [...] who glides through whimsical game worlds with loose objectives. There is no correct {{way to play}} the game, {{which was designed to}} be enjoyed without necessarily pursuing objectives. It is non-linear, and has no score, time limit, or tutorial. The developer described the game as about [...] "relaxing in a space and just enjoying the experience and the music, instead of trying to complete it to make progress", and an IGN preview said it is [...] "simply about the beauty of exploring". USgamer Jeremy Parish wrote that the game's challenges were in distinguishing the interactive objects from the environment and then figuring out the function of those interactive objects. For example, a ball resembling a dandelion releases its spores when circled, but the player has to follow the floating spores to realize that other villagers use the spores as a vehicle. The game communicates with visual and audial cues, and uses few of the standard controller buttons: two buttons slow or accelerate the Long Mover, and the triggers make it wiggle for a boost. The Long Mover changes in color based on the direction it faces, and the DualShock 4's <b>light</b> <b>bar</b> matches the color.|$|E

40|$|Although drivers use various sensory {{channels}} {{to control and}} navigate their vehicles, they acquire most of all driving-related information visually. In fog, no matter what visual acuity is, the visual channel is useless due to the induced poor visibility. Driv-ers react differently to the adverse weather, resulting in high speed variation. That is why it has the high fatal rate during foggy conditions. Then, {{it is imperative to}} provide drivers positive guidance in fog. In this study, the Fog Detect and Warning System (FDWS), being called as the fog lighthouse, was conceived to inform drivers of safety speeds and distances between each vehicle. FDWS includes visibility meters, <b>light</b> <b>bars,</b> and vehicle detectors. The visibility meters calculate sight distances when fog occurs and the estimated sight distances inform drivers through the <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> which are installed at every 30 m intervals. The <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> which display red warning lights inform a following vehicle of the position of the leading vehicle to keep the safety distance between the two vehicles. Since the main lights with the high-bright LED (Light Emitting Diode) have high visibilities, drivers can easily recognize far away. Also microwave sensors together with the <b>light</b> <b>bars</b> are installed to detect the presence of vehicles at every 30 m intervals. The aim of this paper was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the fog system on driver behavior and con-sciousness. As a pilot study, FDWS was implemented on a 1 km section of National Highway No. 37 with a divided four-lane, rural highway. The analysis of the driver behavior was based on mean speed with standard deviation, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to estimate the driver consciousness.
