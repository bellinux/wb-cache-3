5|$|Nichols was {{instructed}} to write the film for Hepburn, {{with whom he had}} worked on John Ford's Mary of Scotland in 1936. Barbara <b>Leaming</b> alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford. Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.|$|E

25|$|While {{attending}} George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she {{had been}} selected from several hundred women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip {{was the subject of}} her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings. On her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara <b>Leaming,</b> the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects, as at the age of 22 she was already considered almost too old to be single in her social circles. Following the advice, she left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} <b>LEAM,</b> a late embryogenesis abundant protein, and HSP 22, a small {{heat shock}} protein, {{were shown to}} accumulate in the mitochondria during pea (Pisum sativum L.) seed development, where {{they are expected to}} contribute to desiccation tolerance. Here, their expression was examined in seeds of 89 pea genotypes by Western blot analysis. All genotypes expressed <b>LEAM</b> and HSP 22 in similar amounts. In contrast with HSP 22, <b>LEAM</b> displayed different isoforms according to apparent molecular mass. Each of the 89 genotypes harboured a single <b>LEAM</b> isoform. Genomic and RT-PCR analysis revealed four <b>LEAM</b> genes differing by a small variable indel in the coding region. These variations were consistent with the apparent molecular mass of each isoform. Indels, which occurred in repeated domains, did not alter the main properties of <b>LEAM.</b> Structural modelling indicated that the class A α-helix structure, which allows interactions with the mitochondrial inner membrane in the dry state, was preserved in all isoforms, suggesting functionality is maintained. The overall results point out the essential character of <b>LEAM</b> and HSP 22 in pea seeds. <b>LEAM</b> variability is discussed in terms of pea breeding history as well as LEA gene evolution mechanisms. </p...|$|R

30|$|BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) is {{the most}} widely used high dose {{chemotherapy}} regimen for autologous transplant in lymphoid malignancies. We report our early experience with an alternative regimen <b>LEAM</b> where BCNU was replaced with the oral analogue CCNU (lomustine) to tide over the non-availability of BCNU. Fifty one patients of relapsed or refractory lymphoma who received BEAM (n= 34) and <b>LEAM</b> (n= 17) from September 2001 to February 2012 were analyzed. From October 2009 onwards <b>LEAM</b> was used as the conditioning regimen instead of conventional BEAM. Patients in the <b>LEAM</b> group had more chemorefractory disease (35 % vs 9 %, p = 0.045) and high risk comorbidity score (24 % vs 0 %, p = 0.019). Grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis (67.6 % vs. 64.7 %, p = 0.834) and diarrhea (47 % vs. 41.1 %, p = 0.691) were similar. No difference was noted between the two groups in terms of engraftment, documented infections, antibiotic use, cumulative toxicity risk, length of hospital stay and 100 day transplant related mortality. The estimated 2 year overall survival (61.7 % vs. 62.7 %, p = 0.928) and event free survival (44.6 % vs. 41.1 %, p = 0.510) of the regimens BEAM and <b>LEAM</b> respectively were comparable. Thus <b>LEAM</b> appeared equivalent to BEAM in terms of toxicity and efficacy and can be used as an alternative to BEAM.|$|R
