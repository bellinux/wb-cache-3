500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, {{as he wanted}} him to feel to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke they’ve seen acting <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really could not look more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan {{got to know each}} other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E
500|$|Brener noted when Mars' audio {{infrastructure}} evolved substantially, when Berry {{took over}} the only model he would use was Sennheiser wireless. The latter's opinion was respected and trusted due to his experience in working [...] with Beyoncé, Weezer and <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bands. Nevertheless, Berry and Brener tried several capsule and transmitter combinations before [...] "settling" [...] with a SKM 5200 handheld transmitter and a MD 5235 capsule. Berry stated that Mars is not only involved with him and Brener [...] "on the way things sound", but also [...] "has very clear ideas on what he wants and what he expects". Regardless of the place where Mars is going to perform he will only use Sennheiser; [...] "there is no debating [...] he wants Sennheiser, and that's what he's going to get", says Berry. As {{for the rest of}} the vocals and horns, the wireless system has ten channels of Sennheiser EM 3732-II receivers, seven SKM 5200-II transmitters with MD 5235 capsules and three SK 5212-II bodypack transmitters.|$|E

500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create its personality. Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. Tom had already worked on <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E

Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak."

[...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E

[...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode.
