25|$|The Tavor uses a non-lubricated <b>long-stroke</b> piston system, {{as found}} in the M1 Garand, IMI Galil, and the AK 47. Like in the AK-47, the <b>long-stroke</b> piston {{mechanism}} contributes to the extreme forcefulness of the TAR-21's extraction and chambering.|$|E
25|$|Built {{around a}} <b>long-stroke</b> piston system (as {{found in the}} M1 Garand and AK-47), the Tavor is {{designed}} to maximize reliability, durability, simplicity of design, and ease of maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|Due to the military's close-quarters and {{mechanized}} infantry requirements, {{the project}} team selected a bullpup design, {{that would allow}} the weapon to be compact while keeping a long barrel able to achieve ballistically favorable high muzzle velocities. A <b>long-stroke</b> piston system, similar to that found in the AK-47 and M1 Garand, was selected to ensure the weapon's reliability under adverse conditions.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the company {{realized}} {{they needed a}} grand tourer model that could appeal to wealthy customers. AC contacted the famed Italian coach builder Pietro Frua to design an appealing GT body that could be fitted on a MKIII Cobra chassis stretched by [...] The new car was shown at the 1965 Turin show. A few early models were fitted with the famed 427 Ford FE motors. In 1967 the <b>long-stroked</b> 428 motor became available and the car {{was known as the}} AC Frua. Built out of steel rather than AC's usual aluminum, the Frua is heavier than a Cobra at slightly under [...] That said, it is still a light and very fast automobile built on a racing chassis. The car was never fully developed and the cost of sending chassis from England to Italy and back for final assembly made it so expensive that only a few were produced. Production ended in 1973 after only 80 cars (29 convertibles and 51 coupes) were finished.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The Launch Table {{supports}} the vehicle on the pad, and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two <b>long-stroke</b> hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled to the pad from the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 1936, the Potez 630-01, {{equipped}} {{with a pair of}} 580hp Hispano-Suiza 14, conducted its maiden flight from Méaulte, Picardy. Initially, the prototype was {{equipped with}} an experimental feature {{in the form of a}} braced horizontal stabilizer that incorporated no dihedreal. On 6 May 1936, the prototype suffered some damage due to a hard landing following the mid-air loss of a propeller blade. On 3 August 1936, after receiving repairs, the Potez 630-01 was transferred to Villacoublay Air Base, Île-de-France; it was soon refitted with an alternative tail arrangement similar to later production aircraft and <b>long-stroke</b> landing gear. On 20 November 1936, flight testing of the prototype resumed; it was shortly thereafter delivered to the Centre d'Essais de Matériels Aériens (CEMA) for official tests.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven <b>long-stroke</b> {{operating}} system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
2500|$|Track racing — High-speed oval racing, {{typically}} with no brakes, nor rear suspension. [...] The engines, fuelled by methanol, are <b>long-stroke</b> four-stroke singles, such as JAP and Jawa. [...] They have at most two gears. [...] Some types, such as speedway, and grass-track bikes, {{are designed}} to take left turns only.|$|E
2500|$|The 2.5-litre {{version of}} the diesel engine, {{displacing}} [...] and producing , was introduced in both the 110 and the newly arrived 90. This was a <b>long-stroke</b> {{version of the}} venerable 2.25-litre unit, fitted with updated fuel injection equipment and a revised cylinder head for quieter, smoother and more efficient running. A timing belt also replaced the older engine's chain.|$|E
2500|$|The R1150GS and R1200GS are {{available}} in an Adventure version which adds a larger fuel tank, lower gearing, upgraded suspension, and optional offroad tires to make the Adventure more suitable for arduous off-road trips with a heavy load of gear and supplies. The horizontally opposed two-cylinder [...] "boxer" [...] engine provides a comparatively low centre of gravity compared to motorcycles with inline-4 or V-twin engines. This strongly contributes {{to the ability of}} these supra-litre class machines to travel on dirt roads and trails. The distribution of torque over a broad RPM range coupled with the relatively wide power pulses inherent in a <b>long-stroke</b> two-cylinder motor provides consistent and predictable traction on loose surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|The LMGs built made a 44% and 43% {{reduction}} of weight (for the cased telescoped and the caseless weapons, respectively). [...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a <b>long-stroke</b> gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249. [...] The standard LSAT machine gun weighs 9.4lb empty, compared to 17.6lb for a standard SAW. [...] Cased telescoped ammunition weighs 40% less than brass-cased ammo, so a 100-round ammunition belt weighs about 2lb for the LSAT, compared to 3.3lb for a brass-cased belt.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{option was}} Pontiac's 455 HO engine (different from the round-port offerings of the 1971–72 cars), {{available}} now that GM had rescinded its earlier ban on intermediates with engines larger than 400. The 455, a <b>long-stroke</b> engine {{also available in}} the full-size Pontiac line {{as well as the}} Grand Prix, was dubiously rated by Pontiac as only moderately stronger than the base 350 HP 400 CID and less powerful than the [...] Ram Air III. The Pontiac brochure indicated the same 455 installed in the Grand Prix model was rated at [...] The camshafts used in the Ram Air III and the GTO 455 HO were the same. For example, the manual transmission 455 HO's used the same 288/302 duration cam as the Ram Air III. The 455 was rated at [...] at 4,300rpm. Its advantage was torque: [...] at 2,700rpm. A functional Ram Air scoop was available. Car and Driver tested a heavily optioned 455, with a four-speed transmission and 3.31 axle and recorded a quarter mile time of 15.0seconds with a trap speed of [...] Car Life test car had the Turbo-Hydramatic 455 with a 3.55 rear differential, clocked 14.76seconds at , with identical 6.6second 0–60mph acceleration. Both were about [...] slower than a Ram Air III 400 four-speed, although considerably less temperamental: the Ram Air engine idled roughly and was difficult to drive at low speeds. The smaller displacement engine recorded less than [...] of gasoline, compared to - for the 455.|$|E
2500|$|The LMG {{design is}} a {{traditionally}} laid-out machine-gun. It has several features conducive to its {{use as a}} light machine gun, such as a quick-change barrel, a vented fore-grip, a belt feeding mechanism, provisions {{for the use of}} an ammunition pouch, and a rate of fire of approximately 600 RPM. [...] Other features include its light weight, an ammunition counter, and a highly stiff and heat resistant barrel achieved with the use of fluting and specialized alloys. [...] When firing, the weapon's chamber swings around a longitudinal pivot; it swings from horizontally parallel with the pivot (the firing position) to vertically parallel (the feed position), and back again. [...] A <b>long-stroke</b> gas-piston is used to operate this action. [...] A round is fed into the chamber at the feed position using a rammer, and the new round also serves to push a spent or dud round out of {{the far end of the}} chamber. [...] Such rounds are pushed forward, parallel to the barrel, and they slide into a separate mechanism that ejects them out of one side of the gun. [...] The advantages of this whole action include its simplicity, its isolation of the chamber from barrel heat, and its positive control of round movement from extraction to ejection. [...] In the caseless firing version of the weapon, another mechanism is introduced to seal the chamber during firing, accounting for the slightly increased weight of the caseless version.|$|E
50|$|The rifle {{uses the}} Galil's <b>long-stroke</b> piston system. The <b>long-stroke</b> system {{is found in}} the M1 Garand, AK-47 (upon which the Galil's {{internal}} mechanism design borrowed heavily) and more recently in the IWI Tavor.|$|E
