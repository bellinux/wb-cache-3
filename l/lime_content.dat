2500|$|A {{considerable}} {{range of}} soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957). Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10nbsp&cm {{below the surface}}, and pH 8.4 at 43nbsp&cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938); rooting depth in those soils was at least 81nbsp&cm. An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Chlorosis was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957). Wilde (1966) gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate optimum range of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968). Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977). High-lime ecotypes may exist (Pelletier 1966), and in Canada Forest Section B8 the presence of balsam poplar and white spruce {{on some of the}} moulded moraines and clays seems to be correlated with the considerable <b>lime</b> <b>content</b> of these materials (Rowe 1972, [...] Stiell 1976), while calcareous soils are favourable sites for northern outliers of white spruce (Hustich 1953).|$|E

40|$|Organic {{content in}} soil is {{believed}} to inhibit formation of reaction products in lime stabilization which resulted in low gain of strength when dealing with organic soils. Zeolite, a kind of pozzolan with high CEC capacity is proposed to be use in this study {{in order to improve}} lime stabilization of organic soil. The effectiveness of blended lime zeolite in stabilization of organic soils was investigated by using two types of artificial organic soils with predetermined organic contents. Artificial organic soils were formed by mixing inorganic soil (commercial kaolin) with organic matter (commercial humic acid) at specific ratio. Initial consumption of lime for organic soils was determined {{in order to determine the}} minimum percentage of stabilizer required for each soil. Potential influencing factors that might affect the strength such as organic contents, contents of stabilizer, and curing periods were studied. The findings of the study showed that high organic <b>contents</b> and low <b>lime</b> <b>contents</b> resulted in lower gain of strength. However, it is found that slight replacement of lime with zeolite works well with low organic soil at long curing period which resulted in highest strength among all the mixes. Overall, longer curing periods will increase the strength of the soil in the order of 56 days > 28 days > 7 days. Nevertheless, the percentage of strength increment over curing periods is linear with the <b>lime</b> <b>contents,</b> which proved that lime is required for pozzolanic reaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} performance cement of production and cement kiln. The design of energy efficient dryers employing heat pump systems and the dynamic response of the product to the kiln conditions must take into account. In this paper, the formulation of a dynamic and kiln-wide drying model is described. The model predictions have been verified by comparing them with the published experimental data. The model is then used to simulate performance of three industrial kilns. Numerical experiments are carried out to investigate influence of key operating and design parameters on energy consumption of kilns. The model is also used to explore the possibility of manipulating temperature profile within the kiln to reduce energy consumption per tonne of clinker. Cement kiln dust is a fine-grained material produced during the manufacture of cement. At present reuse option is limited and the bulk of cement kiln dust that is not reused in the cement manufacturing process is sent to landfills or stored on-site. Due to the calcium oxide (CaO) content of cement kiln dust, it has the potential to be used as a replacement for lime in treating acidic wastewaters such as acid rock drainage. Slaking of two of the cement kiln dust samples with the highest free <b>lime</b> <b>contents</b> (e. g., 34 % and 37 % free of CaO) gave elevated pH values statistically comparable to those of the commercial quicklime sample that was characterized as having 87 % of CaO.

40|$|International audienceDurability of lime-treated soil structures, such as earth dams, dikes or river levees, {{is related}} to stability, or long term {{physicochemical}} evolution of soils in their service environment. The present work aims at (i) providing information on the long term physicochemical behaviour of lime-treated soils subjected to leaching, and (ii) assessing if leaching could be detrimental to the durability of lime-treated soils. Lime addition improves the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of silt by formation of secondary cementitious phases (C-A-S-H, C-A-H,…) and carbonation of lime. The UCS increases with the lime added. Leaching induces a leaching of these secondary phases, as recorded by {{the evolution of the}} chemistry of the leachates. The results obtained indicate that addition of lime up to soil lime modification optimum (LMO at 1 % lime) is not sufficient to maintain long term durability of lime-treated soils.

The raw sludge is usually soft and weak, and takes a large area for storage if stockpiled on open ground, or requires a heavy dam/retaining structure if impounded.
