This is to isolate the frame and body from noise from the gearbox and vibration from the other machinery.|$|R
25|$|Astres were {{confined}} to a single series for 1976, but they were refined with extensive engine, chassis, and body integrity improvements. A modest facelift included a revised grill. The 2.3L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile warranty. The chassis received the new Pontiac Sunbird's upgraded components including the box-section <b>front</b> <b>cross-member,</b> larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads. The body received extensive anti-rust improvements.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Type 128 prototype {{was based}} on the full-length Kübelwagen chassis with a 240 cm (7.9 ft) wheelbase. Pre-production units of the 128, fitted with custom welded bodytubs, demonstrated that this construction was too weak for tough off-roading, had insufficient torsional rigidity, and easily suffered hull-ruptures at the <b>front</b> <b>cross-member,</b> {{as well as in the}} wheel-wells. This was unacceptable for an amphibious vehicle. The large-scale production models (Type 166) were therefore made smaller, and had a wheel-base of only 200 cm (6.6 ft).|$|R
5000|$|The 500C {{features}} fully stamped body-side panels {{retaining the}} hatchback 500's profile (door frames, roof pillars and side windows) to increase structural rigidity, reduce scuttle shake, and retain side and curtain airbags [...] - [...] in trade {{for a less}} open experience than a fully pillarless convertible. Weighing 40 kg (88lbs) more than its hatchback counterpart, the 500C features a slightly longer windshield than the hatchback, with a concealed and reinforced upper structural cross-member; a stronger <b>front</b> <b>cross-member</b> behind the instrument panel; a rear strut on which the retracted roof folds; reinforced B-pillars; and the rear anti-roll bar setup from the Abarth, high performance model.|$|R
40|$|This dataset is {{comprised}} of a spreadsheet of simulation result files, cross-section geometries of stamped parts, strain results of cross-section of stamped parts, simulation data (strain stress displacement energies), and variation data of material properties of a single coil. This data {{is a collection of}} both experimental and simulation results from industrial and laboratory stamping of advanced high strength steels (AHSS). The steels that were stamped were a typical high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel, a transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steel, a super HSLA steel, and a dual phase (DP) steel. The selected part was an automatic Ford Falcon <b>front</b> <b>cross-member</b> component using the Ford Geelong stamping plant. The variation of the material and stamped parts was also collected. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|For 1976, models had 300 changes. A {{facelift}} included revised {{header panel}} with Chevy bowtie emblem, wider grill, revised headlamp bezels - all in corrosion-resistant material - and new tri-color taillights for the notchback and hatchback (although the amber turn signals were nonfunctional). Cooling and durability of the Dura-Built 2.3-liter engine were improved. The chassis received the Monza's upgraded components including box-section <b>front</b> <b>cross-member,</b> larger <b>front</b> and rear brakes (with the fronts gaining vented rotors), and torque-arm rear suspension. Extensive anti-rust {{improvements to the}} body included galvanized fenders and rocker panels. New models were introduced: GT estate wagon, Cabriolet notchback (with a half-vinyl roof and opera windows similar to the Monza Towne coupe) and limited-edition Nomad wagon with restyled side windows. New options included BorgWarner five-speed manual overdrive transmission and houndstooth seat trim named [...] "sport cloth" [...] at an additional $18. A [...] "Sky-Roof" [...] with tinted reflecting sliding glass and an eight-track tape player were options from January. The Cosworth was canceled in July after 1,446 1976 models.|$|R
