For the purpose of saving energy the constant pressure pumps have, in the past, often been replaced by <b>load-sensing</b> pumps and <b>load-sensing</b> valves. In mobile applications these <b>load-sensing</b> solutions have significantly reduced the energy consumption. However, in applications with unequal drive pressure levels the load sensing systems still result in energy losses, referred to as metering losses. Throttling losses associated to load lowering have also been {{paid more attention to}} in the energy debates. By instead adopting direct pump displacement control, with the capability of energy recuperation in lowering motions, many of these losses can be avoided. In this article the author has studied a hydraulic system configuration where each actuator/supply system comprises an electrically controlled variable displacement pump/motor working in an open-circuit together with four separate electrically controlled valves. The four valves render a solution versatile in control, as the cylinder chambers can be connected to pump and/or tank as well as be closed at any time. Depending on how the valves are controlled different modes of operation are achieved, which in turn yields different total energy efficiency depending on the present working point. In this study the performance, operability and energy consumption is evaluated in a wheel loader that is first looked upon with its original load sensing hydraulic system and then modified with a completely new pump controlled hydraulic system. Measurements published in this article demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of pump control in an open circuit compared to a load sensing system. Performance is evaluated by looking at productivity, loading capacity and duty cycle time of a typical loading cycle. Operability is evaluated by looking at response times, load oscillations and driver comfort. Theoretical calculations of energy efficiency including metering and throttling losses over the valves as well as pump efficiency, line losses and losses in the recuperation phase are evaluated and validated.

40|$|This work studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications, {{referred to as}} flow control. The fundamental difference compared to <b>load-sensing</b> systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operator’s command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump pressure margin. Furthermore, <b>load-sensing</b> systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed-loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. This allows the pump to be {{designed to meet the}} response requirements without considering system stability. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This study addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using traditional compensators in combination with a flow-controlled pump.

Space flight causes astronauts {{to be exposed to}} somatosensory adaptation in both the vestibular and body <b>load-sensing</b> (BLS) systems. The goal of these studies was to examine the contributions of vestibular and BLS-mediated somatosensory influences on head movement control during locomotion after long-duration space flight. Subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill driven at 1. 8 m/s while performing a visual acuity task. Data were collected using the same testing protocol from three independent subject groups; 1) normal subjects before and after exposure to 30 minutes of 40 % bodyweight unloaded treadmill walking, 2) bilateral labyrinthine deficient (LD) patients and 3) astronauts who performed the protocol before and after long duration space flight. Motion data from head and trunk segmental motion data were obtained to calculate the angular head pitch (HP) movements during walking trials while subjects performed the visual task, to estimate the contributions of vestibular reflexive mechanisms in HP movements. Results showed that exposure to unloaded locomotion caused a significant increase in HP movements, whereas in the LD patients the HP movements were significantly decreased. Astronaut subjects results showed a heterogeneous response of both increases and decreases in the amplitude of HP movement. We infer that BLS-mediated somatosensory input centrally modulates vestibular input and can adaptively modify head-movement control during locomotion. Thus, space flight may cause a central adaptation mediated by the converging vestibular and body <b>load-sensing</b> somatosensory systems...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the highly}} complex {{structure}} of the <b>load-sensing</b> pump, its compensators and controlling elements, simulation of <b>load-sensing</b> pump system pose many challenges to researchers. One way to overcome some of the difficulties with creating complex computer model {{is the use of}} “black box” approach to create an approximation of the system behaviour by analyzing input/output relationships. That means the details of the physical phenomena are not so much of concern in the “black box” approach. Neural network can be used to implement the black box concept for system identification and it is proven that the neural network have the ability to model very complex behaviour and there is a well defined set of neural and neural network structures. Previous studies have shown the problems and limitations in dynamic system modeling using static neuron based neural networks. Some new neuron structures, Dynamic Neural Units (DNUs), have been developed which open a new area to the research associated with the system modelling. The overall objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of using a dynamic neural unit (DNU) based dynamic neural network (DNN) in modeling a hydraulic component (specifically a <b>load-sensing</b> pump), and the model could be used in a simulation with any other required component model to aid in hydraulic system design. To be truly representative of the component, the neural network model must be valid for both the steady state and the transient response. Due to three components (compensator, pump and control valve) in a load sensing pump system, there were three different pump model structures (the pump, compensator and valve model, the compensator and pump model, and the “pump only” model) from the practical point of view, and they were analysed thoroughly in this study. In this study, the DNU based DNN was used to model a “pump only” model which was a portion of a complete load sensing pump. After the trained DNN was tested {{with a wide variety of}} system inputs and due to the steady state error illustrated by the trained DNN, compensation equation approach and DNN and SNN combination approach were then adopted to overcome the steady state deviation. It was verified, through this work, that the DNU based DNN can capture the dynamics of a nonlinear system, and the DNN and SNN combination can eliminate the steady state error which was generated by the trained DNN. The first major contribution of this research was in investigating the feasibility of using the DNN to model a nonlinear system and eliminating the “error accumulation” problem encountered in the previous work. The second major contribution is exploring the combination of DNN and SNN to make the neural network model valid for both steady state and the transient response...|$|E

The pump is electrically controlled and is used either in pressure control mode or flow control mode depending on the state of operation. Along with the hardware described above, the open-circuit solution requires a number of electronic sensors as well as a microprocessor control system, hence the system is a mechatronic system. In contrast to a conventional hydraulic system the control objectives in this concept are not strictly defined by the hardware configuration, but instead many of its critical parameters can be adjusted in software, thus an increased flexibility in system design is obtained. Consequently, defining the desired system properties becomes even more important. Furthermore system robustness must be considered to a greater extent, due to the increased number of sensors and components. The main focus in this paper is to show how machine operability and performance depends on a set of chosen control strategies, what can be achieved as to energy efficiency and driver comfort and at what cost. Additionally the trade-off between energy efficiency and comfort is discussed. In previous work the author has investigated the influence on energy efficiency by lowering loads in different modes of operation, in respect to how the valves are controlled. In this article strategies to decide which mode of operation is the most energy efficient are considered, and how transitions between these modes can be handled by pressure matching prior to opening valves. As the open circuit solution does not support energy storage over time, methods to manage recuperated excess energy is investigated in order to prevent the primary mover from speeding up.

40|$|AbstractGenerally speaking, {{hydraulic}} control {{systems can be}} divided into two different driving concepts. The first one is the well-known valve-controlled system and the second one is the pump-controlled system. The former possesses the feature of fast dynamic response. However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving hydraulic tube bender is conducted. Instead of the conventional fixed displacement hydraulic pump, the new hydraulic tube bender utilizes an internal gear pump with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of <b>load-sensing</b> control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed hydraulic tube bender can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional hydraulic tube bender...|$|E

These protocols are Y-"local" {{in the sense that they}} transmit packets only between Y-adjacent vertices and LLS since they base their "routing decisions" dynamically on queue-sizes of their neighbors and their relative distance to the destination. In the system each vertex has specific data-queues indexed by its respective Y-neighbors. The state of a vertex then consists of the collection of queue-sizes. The data-transmission protocols are formally specified in the framework of sequential dynamical systems, which allows us to categorize and classify our experiments. We will investigate the following scenario: for fixed Y we assume a single source/destination pair to be given and a system-update then consists of the collection of local protocol updates according to some fixed permutation of the Y-vertices. We then iterate the system-updates and thereby obtain the time evolution of the queue-sizes of the vertices. We will present and discuss results on the evolution of the load, i. e. the total number of packets in the network, the throughput, i. e. the rate at which packets arrive at the destination, and study the dependence of the queue-size dynamics on various other system parameters. In particular, we will analyze update schedule dependency and the impact of queue-capacity on system stability. We will show that our protocols can adapt and dynamically utilize new routes in a fixed network. Sequential dynamical system, TCP, network, protocol...|$|E
40|$|Galvanic {{vestibular}} stimulation (GVS) evokes {{responses in}} muscles of both legs when bilateral stimuli are applied during normal stance. We {{have used this}} technique to assess whether asymmetrical standing alters the distribution of responses in the two legs. Subjects stood either asymmetrically with 75 % of their body weight on one leg or symmetrically with each leg taking 50 % of their body weight. The net response in each leg was taken from changes in ground reaction force measured from separate force plates under each foot. The net force profile consisted of a small initial force change that peaked at ∼ 200 ms followed by an oppositely directed larger component that peaked at ∼ 450 ms. We analysed the second force component since it {{was responsible for the}} kinematic response of lateral body sway and tilt towards the anode. In the horizontal plane, both legs produced lateral force responses that were in the same direction but larger in the leg ipsilateral to the cathodal ear. There were also vertical force responses that were of equal size in both legs but acted in opposite directions. When subjects stood asymmetrically the directions of the force responses remained the same but their magnitudes changed. The lateral force response became 2 - 3 times larger for the more loaded leg and the vertical forces increased 1. 5 times on average for both legs. Control experiments showed that these changes could not be explained by either the consistent (< 5 deg) head tilt towards the side of the loaded leg or the changes in background muscle activity associated with the asymmetrical posture. We conclude that the redistribution of force responses in the two legs arises from a <b>load-sensing</b> mechanism. We suggest there is a central interaction between load-related afferent input from the periphery and descending motor signals from balance centres...|$|E
