TIle first cltapter considers the contracting problem facing multiple principals, each of whom de-sires to contract with the same agent. If the agent has private infonnation regarding his gains froDl the contracting activity and the con~racting activities in tIle principal-agent relationships are substitutable (coDlplementary), the principals will typically extract less (more) infonnation rents in total and induce less (more) productive i~lefficiency in the contracting equilibrium than {{if there were a}} sillgle principal contracting over the SaIne activities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sharing of}} risk under three different remedies for breach of contract. The risk considered arises from the possibility that, after a seller and buyer have entered into an agreement for the exchange of some (not generally available) good, a third party who values the good more than the original buyer may come along before delivery has occurred; the seller will want to breach. It is shown that this risk is optimally allocated by the expectation damage remedy if the seller is risk neutral and the buyer is risk averse, by the specific performance remedy if the opposite is true, and by a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> remedy if both parties are risk averse. The level of damages under the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> remedy is also shown to be bounded by the expectation measure of damages and a "damage equivalent" to the specific performance remedy. By means of a numerical example, it is shown that use of the prevailing remedy for breach of contract [...] the expectation damage remedy [...] may plausibly cause a welfare loss {{of as much as}} 20 % due to inappropriate risk sharing. ...|$|E
40|$|Contract law’s <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> rules prevent {{enforcement}} of contractual damage measures {{that require the}} promisor, if it breaches, to transfer to the promisee a sum that exceeds the net gain the promisee expected to make from performance; but these rules permit the promisor to transfer less than the promisee’s expectation. We define a contractual damage multiplier as any number between zero and infinity by which the promisee’s expected gain [...] its expectation interest [...] is multiplied. Multipliers of one or less thus comply with the <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> rules while multipliers that exceed one do not; the high multipliers are unenforceable penalties. This paper shows that multipliers of any size can be efficient or inefficient, depending on the parties’ purposes in creating them. For example, a multiplier that exceeds one will decrease welfare if used by a seller with market power to deter entry; but will increase welfare if used by parties to induce efficient relation specific investment. As a consequence, a court should inquire, not into {{the size of the}} multiplier, but into the purpose the multiplier serves for the parties. The practical implication of this view is that it no longer should be a sufficient defense to an action to enforce a contractual damage measure that the parties’ multiplier exceeded one...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of the Benzal Bridge over the White River in rural Arkansas brought about years of litigation between Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and contractor San Ore-Gardner, the crux of which was whether the liquidated damages provision in the parties 2 ̆ 7 contract was enforceable. The liquidated damages provision at issue provided that San Ore-Gardner would be liable to Missouri Pacific Railroad Company for damages {{in the amount of}} 600 per day if performance of the contract was not completed within the specified time period. Although Missouri Pacific Railroad Company did contribute to the over two year delay in completion of the Benzal Bridge Project, the evidence showed that its responsibility was far less than that of San Ore-Gardner. The Eighth Circuit held that any act contributing to the failure to meet contractual deadlines, regardless of whether the levels of the parties fault was disproportionate, prevented enforcement of the liquidated damages provision. This note argues that the Eighth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding {{is one of the worst}} things to happen to Arkansas construction law in the last thirty years. Not only are <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions a fundamental principal to freedom of contract, but <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions also allow courts to award an identifiable amount of damages that were bargained for by the parties and would otherwise be difficult to determine in litigation. Courts are split on the issue of enforcement of a damage provision when the party seeking enforcement contributed to the breach. Traditionally, courts would not allow enforcement in such a situation. However, modern courts follow the apportionment rule, where the court will apportion fault and enforce the damage provision in accordance with the parties 2 ̆ 7 corresponding levels of fault. The background section of this note considers the development of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> law, including the historical backgrounds which lead to parties bargaining for remedies in the event of a breach of contract, the current state of the law regarding <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions, and development of the apportionment rule. Next, the note considers problems faced by jurisdictions opposing the apportionment rule. In particular, the traditional rule contravenes public policy (as found in a state 2 ̆ 7 s constitution and statutory scheme) in states that have enacted portions of the Uniform Commercial Code and comparative fault statutes that operate comparatively to the apportionment theory. Further, not applying the apportionment rule infringes on the parties 2 ̆ 7 freedom to contract and in turn prolongs litigation in ascertaining the proper award of damages. In conclusion, the note proposes that the modern approach 2 ̆ 7 s apportionment rule is supported by Arkansas public policy and should be expressly adopted by Arkansas courts...|$|E
40|$|Part I of this Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> provisions and penalties {{in the context of}} a general theory of efficient breach of contract. The proof problems inherent in fully recovering idiosyncratic values within the context of operationally practical damage sanctions may prevent the non-breaching party from recovering his subjective expectations if recovery is limited to legally determined remedies. The expected cost of establishing true losses under conventional damage measures will thus induce parties who face uncertain or nonprovable anticipated losses to negotiate stipulated damage agreements. The current penalty rule subjects these agreements to costly review, based not on the fairness of the process, but on whether the initial estimate sufficiently mirrors the anticipated provable loss. Part II {{examines the}} hypothesis that, absent evidence of process unfairness in bargaining, efficiency will be enhanced by the enforcement of an agreed allocation of risks embodied in a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> clause. We argue that agreed damage measures and in terrorem provisions represent, under many circumstances, the most efficient means by which parties can insure against the otherwise non-compensable consequences of breach.

The author points out three different kinds of limits that can restrict freedom of the parties: efficiency, distributive justice and values. According to the author the interpreter’s task is to clarify on which basis the chosen solution lies. The fulfillment of this task is essential for a correct understanding of the current debate on the making of a European private law and can greatly help in elucidating the background of central issues in European contract law (i. e. consumer protection). In the author’s view arguments of “social justice” are often used in the current debate without any regard to political philosophy background.

40|$|The {{equitable}} {{principle of}} relief from penalties and forfeitures {{is so far}} elementary as almost to defy analysis. Many, perhaps most, of the judicial explanations of the principle have based it upon interpretation or construction, appealing to the doctrine that equity regards intent rather than form. Yet a logical application of this doctrine would lead to results very different from those which have actually been arrived at in the decisions. Thus, a stipulation in a mortgage that the mortgagor waives his equity of redemption can hardly be interpreted as meaning {{that he does not}} waive it, yet all such stipulations are ignored and redemption granted, nevertheless. Again, a penalty for breach of contract cannot be saved by the most solemn declaration that it is intended as liquidated damages.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 41 - 42). Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential to be ensured in the procurement using public funds. In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier {{due to a lack}} of proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) is continually monitoring the compliance of PPA 2006 and PPR 2008 by the target agencies in the light of 45 predetermined Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Among the four target agencies, LGED is the largest in terms of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services which are administered by PPR 2008. Thus, it seems to be a good consideration to have a look at the compliance issues of PPR 2008 in LGED’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions if LGED is following PPR 2008 completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of compliance of PPR 2008 by LEGD and to find out the gap of compliance and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from LGED and SRGB, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect primary data from different stakeholders related to procurement activities of LGED. For in-depth study on the compliance issues of PPR 2008, eight different projects were studied carefully to collect the qualitative data too. In addition to survey, key informant interviews have been conducted to get the perceptions of few senior officers of LGED and IMED. The study result shows a clear adherence to the rules of PPR 2008 in LGED in carrying out most of the compliance related KPIs. The individual consultant’s reports as well as SRGB’s report also show a clear indication of compliance of PPR 2008 by LGED. Among the 11 different compliance issues, it has been revealed that respondents replied in an overall positive manner as satisfactory against 7 issues. For other 4 issues namely submission of report by the TEC, imposition of <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage,</b> days taken to release payment, and interest for delayed payment are not satisfactory and a clear improvement is required in these areas. Also, the perceptions of the respondents regarding the issue of releasing payment need to investigate more cautiously as there are ambiguity among the findings of present study, individual consultant’s reports and SRGB’s report. However, the scenario is more or less similar in other target agencies For improvement of these situations, four specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) to induce a mechanism for ensuring that TER is directly submitted to the contract approving authority as per Rule 36 (3) of PPR 2008, (ii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund, (iii) a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> clause and (iv) payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Until 2003, there was no standard and legal framework for public procurement in Bangladesh and General Financial Rules (GFR) had regulated public procurement procedures and practices in Bangladesh. These rules were originally issued during the British period and slightly revised in 1951 under the Pakistani rule. After Bangladesh’s independence, few changes were made to these rules in 1994 and 1999 respectively (Islam, 2011). To ensure transparency,accountability and better value for money in the procurement of goods, works or services using public funds, and ensuring equitable treatment and free and fair competition among all persons wishing to participate in such procurement, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act 2006 (hereinafter called PPA 2006) on 06 July 2006. Under the framework of PPA 2006, the government issued Public Procurement Rules 2008 (hereinafter called PPR 2008) which has come into effective on January 31, 2008. All these were the outcomes of the reform process taken {{by the government to}} streamline the public procurement. Earlier in 2003, Public procurement Regulations 2003 which was effective till the PPR 2008 was issued (Hoque, 2010). Among the government agencies, DPHE is subject to large amount of budget allocation against the projects in the Annual Development Programme (ADP). It is generally said that a total of 80 % of ADP allocation are spent for procurement of goods, works and services which are administered by PPR 2008. Thus, {{it seems to be a}} good consideration to have a look at how DPHE is ensure value for money through using PPR 2008 in it’s procurement activities. The research has been designed under the questions get an idea about is present procurement practices in DPHE under PPR 2008 achieving value for money completely or not; and if not, then the causes behind that. The main objectives of the present study are to find out the extent of achieving value for money by DPHE and to find out the gap and scope of improvement for implementation. The related literatures and reports, particularly from DPHE, PPR 2008 and other international practices in public sector, have been thoroughly reviewed before conducting the main research work. The key findings of these reports have been compared and analyzed which helped to draw important conclusion of the study. The methodology of this study to undertake are (i) questionnaire survey for primary data (ii) key informant interviews (iii) Secondary data collect from project offices and DPHE website. Questionnaire survey was carried out to collect primary data from different stakeholders related to procurement activities of DPHE. For in-depth study on getting value for money different projects were studied carefully to collect the qualitative data too. In addition to survey, key informant interviews have been conducted to get the perceptions of few senior officers of DPHE. The study result shows a clear perceptions that DPHE is far away from better value for money procurement. However, the scenario is more or less similar in other government agencies. The main focus on compliance with the public procurement regulation and emphasizing the transparent use of competitive procedures, rather than necessarily achievement of competitive supply or added value outcomes lead DPHE as well as other government agencies not to always encourage in best practice procurement, in areas such as economic, efficiency and effectiveness. For improvement of these situations, four specific recommendations have been drawn. These are (i) to induce a mechanism for ensuring that TER is directly submitted to the contract approving authority as per Rule 36 (3) of PPR 2008, (ii) to ensure the timely payment to the contractors, tender should be floated only after availability of sufficient fund, (iii) a <b>liquidated</b> <b>damage</b> clause and (iv) payment of interest in case of delayed payment should be considered carefully to protect the interests of both the parties...|$|E
