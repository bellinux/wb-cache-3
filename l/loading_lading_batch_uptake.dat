When amine loading is increased by coupling aminopropyl groups, premature breakthrough combined with a long tail is observed.

40|$|Ammonia-nitrogen uptake by sterile Ulva sp. was {{studied for}} the control of culture pond water of {{intensive}} shrimp farming. The uptake rates were measured by batch and semi-continuous operations, and analyzed with the Michaelis-Menten model of uncompetitive inhibition. For the <b>batch</b> <b>uptake</b> operations, the Michaelis-Menten parameters were estimated, and the maximum rate and Michaelis constants were estimated as 3. 4 × 10 – 2 kg kg– 1 h– 1 and 5. 5 × 10 – 3 kg m– 3, respectively. The inhibitory factor increased with the uptake time and with the decrease of the seaweed density.

From the HTS data, one resin of each type was selected (Capto Q and Octyl Sepharose 4 FF).

40|$|Scanning {{confocal}} {{fluorescence microscopy}} and multiphoton fluorescence microscopy {{were used to}} image the uptake of the protein lysozyme into individual ion exchange chromatography particles in a packed bed in real time. Self-sharpening concentration fronts penetrating into the particles were observed at low salt concentrations {{in all of the}} adsorbents studied, but persisted to 100 mM ionic strength only in some materials. In other adsorbents, diffuse profiles were seen at these higher salt concentrations, with the transition region exhibiting a pronounced fluorescence peak at the front at intermediate salt concentrations. These patterns in the uptake profiles are accompanied by significant increases in protein uptake rates that are also seen macroscopically in <b>batch</b> <b>uptake</b> experiments. The fluorescence peak appears to be a concentration overshoot that may develop, in part, from an electrokinetic contribution to transport that also enhances the uptake rate. Further evidence for an electrokinetic origin is that the effect is correlated with high adsorbent surface charge densities. Predictions of a mathematical model incorporating the electrokinetic effect are in qualitative agreement with the observations. These findings indicate that mechanisms other than diffusion contribute to protein transport in oppositely charged porous materials and may be exploited to achieve rapid uptake in process chromatography...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{is part of}} a series of {{adsorption}} studies of various As compounds to the iron(III) oxyhydroxide goethite. The goal of these studies was to obtain a consistent set of experimental data covering a range of conditions (such as As/goethite ratio or ionic strength at variable pH), which should be apt to testing surface complexation models. Arsenite is interesting in this respect because over a wide range of pH it exists as H 3 AsO 3. Modelling often requires a range of surface species, but such a range is difficult to justify in cases such as arsenite, i. e. protonation of H 3 AsO 3 is not expected. The prospective modelling is also constrained by the use of different experimental methods (see Experimental section) : in particular uptake data were obtained for As and H over a range of As/goethite ratios, whereas most conventional studies involve uptake data only.

40|$|A. M. LenhoffRecent {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} adsorption and transport properties of ion-exchange adsorbents have included the modification of the adsorbent base matrix with a secondary polymer layer. This work {{attempts to}} characterize the relevant adsorption and transport properties of two related strong cation exchange adsorbents, Toyopearl GigaCap and Toyopearl SP- 650 M, which differ in that the GigaCap adsorbent consists of the SP- 650 M base matrix functionalized with a secondary-polymer layer. The studies performed utilized a combination of equilibrium adsorption isotherm determination, <b>batch</b> <b>uptake,</b> and isocratic pulse response experiments. Results were obtained for two model proteins, lysozyme (14. 7 kDa) and lactoferrin (78 kDa), and were compared between the adsorbents to allow for elucidation {{of the effects of}} protein charge, protein size, and GigaCap???s secondary-polymer layer on the transport and adsorption behavior. The <b>batch</b> <b>uptake</b> results indicate higher effective pore diffusivities for lysozyme than for lactoferrin, but similar effective pore diffusivities for the respective proteins in the two adsorbents. The adsorption isotherms indicate that both proteins display much higher static capacities for the GigaCap S- 650 M particles than for the SP 650 M particles. While the capacity differences are significant at low ionic strengths, they are drastically reduced at high ionic strengths, a trend that is more significant in lactoferrin than lysozyme. Retention experiments indicate decreasing retention between the protein-adsorbent pairs of lactoferrin on SP- 650 M, lysozyme on GigaCap, and lysozyme on SP- 650 M, as well as evidence of lactoferrin exclusion from GigaCap???s secondary polymer layer. Taken together, the adsorption and retention experiments indicate that lactoferrin is excluded from GigaCap???s secondary polymer layer high ionic strengths, and is partially excluded at lower ionic strengths. This exclusion appears to be a combination of steric effects, due to conformational changes in the polymer layer that reduce the accessibility for protein binding due to polymer shrinkage at high ionic strengths, and a decrease in the electrostatic forces that drive solute partitioning into the polymer layer. These effects are most significant at high ionic strengths, where lactoferrin is excluded from the polymer layer, but also appear at lower ionic strengths, where large differences in lactoferrin capacity are observed between ionic strengths of 20 mM and 50 mM. This exclusion behavior is observed for ionic strengths that are relevant for chromatographic process operations. It is thus important to be aware of these effects during process design, as relatively small ionic strength deviations may result in drastic changes in process performance. It is also relevant to future resin design, as it may be desirable to either reduce or exploit these effects in future adsorbents. Specifically, it presents an opportunity to design ion-exchange resins that have high affinity for ions of a specific molecular size range. It also demonstrates that changes must be made {{to the nature of the}} polymer layer before these adsorbents can display robust, high capacities for larger macromolecules. Chemical Engineerin...|$|R

Results from gradient elutions, stirred batch adsorptions and confocal laser scanning microscopic investigations were used to elucidate binding behavior of mAbs onto Eshmuno™ S and Fractogel® SO 3 − and the corresponding transport mechanisms on these two resins. The number of charges involved in mAb binding for Eshmuno™ S is lower than for Fractogel® SO 3 −, indicating a slightly weaker electrostatic interaction.

40|$|Studies of the {{chemical}} properties of superheavy elements (SHE) pose interesting challenges due to their short half-lives and low production rates. Chemical systems must have extremely fast kinetics, fast enough kinetics {{to be able to}} examine {{the chemical}} properties of interest before the SHE decays to another nuclide. To achieve chemistry on such time scales, the chemical system must also be easily automated. Most importantly however, a chemical system must be developed which provides suitable separation and kinetics before an on-line study of a SHE can be performed. Relativistic effects make studying the chemical properties of SHEs interesting due to the impact these effects could have on the SHEs chemical properties. Relativistic effects arise when the velocity of the s orbital electrons approach the speed of light. As this velocity increases, the Bohr radius of the inner electron orbitals decreases and there is an increase in the particles mass. This contraction results in a destabilization of the energy of the outer d and f electron orbitals (5 f and 6 d in the case of SHE), which can cause these to expand due to their increased shielding from the nuclear charge. Another relativistic effect is the spin-orbit splitting for p, d, and f orbitals into j = 1 {+-} 1 / 2 states. This can lead most interestingly to a possible increased stability of element 114, which due to large spin-orbit splitting of the 7 p orbital and the relativistically stabilized 7 p{sub 1 / 2 } and 7 s orbital gives rise to a closed shell ground state of 7 s{sup 2 } 7 p{sub 1 / 2 }{sup 2 }. The homologs of element 105, dubnium (Db), Ta and Nb and the pseudo-homolog Pa, are well known to hydrolyze and form both neutral and non-neutral monoatomic and polyatomic species that may cause issues with extraction from a given chemical system. Early ion-exchange and solvent-extraction studies show mixed results for the behavior of Db. Some studies show Db behaving most similar to Ta, while others show it behaving somewhere between Nb and Pa. Much more recent studies have examined the properties of Db from HNO{sub 3 }/HF matrices, and suggest Db forms complexes similar to those of Pa. Very little experimental work into the behavior of element 114 has been performed. Thermochromatography experiments of three atoms of element 114 indicate that the element 114 is at least as volatile as Hg, At, and element 112. Lead was shown to deposit on gold at temperatures about 1000 C higher than the atoms of element 114. Results indicate a substantially increased stability of element 114. No liquid phase studies of element 114 or its homologs (Pb, Sn, Ge) or pseudo-homologs (Hg, Cd) have been performed. Theoretical predictions indicate that element 114 is should have a much more stable + 2 oxidation state and neutral state than Pb, which would result in element 114 being less reactive and less metallic than Pb. The relativistic effects on the 7 p{sub 1 / 2 } electrons are predicted to cause a diagonal relationship to be introduced into the periodic table. Therefore, 114 {sup 2 +} is expected to behave as if it were somewhere between Hg{sup 2 +}, Cd{sup 2 +}, and Pb{sup 2 +}. In this work two commercially available extraction chromatography resins are evaluated, one for the separation of Db homologs and pseudo?homologs from each other as well as from potential interfering elements such as Group IV Rf homologs and actinides, and the other for separation of element 114 homologs. One resin, Eichrom's DGA resin, contains a N,N,N',N'-tetra-n-octyldiglycolamide extractant, which separates analytes based on both size and charge characteristics of the solvated metal species, coated on an inert support. The DGA resin was examined for Db chemical systems, and shows a high degree of selectivity for tri-, tetra-, and hexavalent metal ions in multiple acid matrices with fast kinetics. The other resin, Eichrom's Pb resin, contains a di-t-butylcyclohexano 18 -crown- 6 extractant with isodecanol solvent, which separates analytes based on steric interactions between the cavity of the crown ether and electrostatic interactions between the oxygen's of the ether and cations in the mobile phase. This particular resin has been shown to have an extremely high uptake affinity for Pb, a direct homolog of element 114, and is thus a good initial extractant to examine for a potential element 114 chemical system. Figure 1. 1 shows the respective extractant molecules from the DGA and Pb resins. <b>Batch</b> <b>uptake</b> experiments were conducted to examine the uptake behavior of Ta on the DGA resin. <b>Batch</b> <b>uptake</b> experiments were also conducted to examine the uptake behavior of Ge on the Pb resin.

The chromatographic performance of the macrobeads was first assessed by the classical height equivalent of a theoretical plate HETP analysis. The independence of HETP on linear flow rates studied suggests that a likely mode of solute transport within the macrobeads may be a combination of convection and diffusion-convective components. By using fluorescent-tagged immunoglobulins, the penetration of the adsorbent particle at different times and different levels of saturation was visually observed. The profiles obtained from dynamic experiments were compared to the profiles obtained from finite bath experiments. With an increase in the incubation time, the degree of penetration increased and the bead interior was saturated with FITC immunoglobulins at the end point of the finite bath experiment. In the dynamic uptake experiment, the degree of penetration was found to be a function of the linear velocity and level of breakthrough. The penetration of the bead radius, at times lower than the predicted diffusion time, suggests that the mode of transport in the chitosan beads is governed by a combination of convective and diffusive forces...|$|R

The use of two different fluorescent dyes for protein labeling and two independent detectors, allowed direct observation of a two-component adsorption process. The confocal technique was also applied for visualization of nucleic acids. Plasmid DNA and RNA were visualized with fluorescent probes that binds to double stranded DNA and RNA respectively. Confocal measurements following single component adsorption to ion exchange particles, revealed an interesting phenomenon. Under certain experimental conditions, development of "inner radial concentration rings" (i. e. adsorbed phase concentrations that are higher at certain radial positions within the particle) were observed. Some examples are given that show how such concentration rings are formed within a particle. Methods were also developed for measurement of the spatial distribution of immobilized functional groups. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the immobilization of trypsin on porous glycidyl methacrylate beads. Artefacts relating to optical length differences could be reduced by use of "contrast matching". Confocal microscopy and confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, were used to analyze the spatial distribution of IgG antibodies immobilized on BrCN-activated agarose beads. Both these measurement methods indicate an even ligand distribution.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{properties of the}} heaviest elements are of particular interest because relativistic effects increase as proton number squared. Transactinides, elements where relativistic effects {{are expected to be}} the largest, do not exist naturally; they are produced via fusion-evaporation reactions.

At the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M University, a device for the thermalization of fusion-evaporation reaction products, the Recoil Transfer Chamber (RTC), has been designed, fabricated, and characterized.

With the existing 1 : 15 ratio of industrial to total wastewater flow a 50 % inhibition to the nitrification process was observed, which is higher than the 25 - 30 % inhibition caused by typical domestic sewage. Industrial contributions exceeding 20 % resulted in complete inhibition of nitrification. With respect to denitrification it was found that the industrial wastewater provided a suitable source of carbon, without any adverse effects on denitrification. Pre-precipitation removed about 25 % of the filtered COD, thus reducing the amount of nitrates which could be rapidly denitrified. Design of the biological reactors on the basis of the findings indicate that a significant under-design may result if typical nitrification and denitrification rates obtained from the literature and practice concerning typical domestic sewage are adopted...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of banana stem fiber (BSF) as a low cost biosorbent for Hg(II) removal was studied. HCl treatment increased the cellulose accessibility {{which led to}} an enhanced interaction of Hg(II) and BSF. Activation of BSF-HCl in vacuo at 373 K increased the maximum biosorption capacity from 28 to 372 mg g(- 1) and altered the activation energy from 3. 5 to 76. 9 kJ mol(- 1) showing an increase in Hg(II) chemisorption. FTIR and ESR results confirmed {{the large amount of}} structural defects on the activated BSF-HCl which led to the increase in Hg(II) <b>uptake.</b> <b>Batch</b> biosorption models showed that the kinetics follow pseudo-second-order and the equilibrium uptake fitted to all three-parameter models showing the Hg(II) biosorption behaves as a Langmuir isotherm. The non-linear regression method exhibited higher coefficient of determination values for isotherm and kinetic analyses compared to the linear method. The thermodynamic functions indicated that the nature of Hg(II) biosorption is an exothermic and non-spontaneous process...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{understanding}} of the metabolism of Escherichia coli {{has been one of}} the main topics in microbiology research. Phenomena like the glucose effect or the inducer exclusion have been detected and described. It is known that Escherichia coli prefers glucose as carbon- and ammonium salt as nitrogen- source. Older publications describe growth of the wildtype and of mutant strains with limiting or unlimiting concentrations of different carbon- or nitrogen sources. Most of these descriptions are only qualitative. Many details have been elucidated about the regulation of nitrogen and carbon metabolism but little is known about their coordination. Therefore we measured in a systematic way growth rates of Escherichia coli LJ 110 under carbon-, nitrogen- or carbon- and nitrogen limiting conditions in <b>batch</b> experiments. The <b>uptake</b> of carbohydrates is regulated by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems especially the protein kinase enzyme EIIACrr and the global regulator complex cAMP.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of sediment slurry Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) to treat Venice lagoon sediments contaminated by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated, carrying out experimental tests. The slurry, obtained mixing tap water and contaminated sediments with 17. 1 mg kg - 1 TS total PAHs content, was loaded to a 8 l lab-scale completely stirred reactor, operated as a sequencing <b>batch</b> reactor. Oxygen <b>Uptake</b> Rate exerted by the slurry, measured {{by means of}} a DO-stat titrator, was used to monitor the in-reactor biological activity and to select the optimal operating conditions for the sediment slurry SBR. The PAHs removal efficiency was evaluated in different operating conditions, obtained changing the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of the lab-scale reactor and adding an external carbon source to the slurry. HRT values used during the experiments are 98, 70 and 35 days, whereas the carbon source was added in order to evaluate its effect on the biological activity. The results have shown a stable degradation of PAHs, with a removal efficiency close to 55 %, not dependent on the addition of carbon source and the tested HRTs...|$|R
40|$|Whey is a {{by-product}} of cheese manufacture, containing a mixture of proteins of commercial value, each having unique attributes for nutritional, biological and food ingredient applications. A tremendous amount of whey, normally treated as a waste product, is produced worldwide each year. This work describes the cation-exchange adsorption {{of the two major}} whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) with the purpose of optimising a process for isolating them from whey. Adsorption of pure BLG and ALA was studied onto SP Sepharose FF using 0. 1 M acetate buffer. Batch experiments were carried out at various pH values for ALA and BLG, and the relevant Langmuir isotherm parameters, dissociation constant, Kd, and maximum binding capacity, qm, were determined. The optimum pH for separation was chosen to be pH 3. 7. At pH 3. 7, both Kd and qm pertaining to ALA were found to have higher numerical values than those of BLG, implying different characteristics of adsorption of the two proteins on this adsorbent. The Kd for the former protein was almost four times larger than the latter, while qm was 1. 3 times higher. Packed-bed column adsorption was performed using a 1 -ml column at pH 3. 7, flow rate 1 ml/min and initial concentration of 3 mg/ml for BLG and 1. 5 mg/ml for ALA both in 0. 1 M sodium acetate buffer. The t 1 / 2 for the resulting ALA breakthrough was 75 % longer than its BLG counterpart. The above results suggest the possibility of the occurrence of competitive adsorption between the proteins when adsorbed simultaneously. In traditional <b>batch</b> <b>uptake</b> experiments, the kinetic rate constants of ALA and BLG in both the single- and two-component systems were determined using the simple kinetic model. The values so obtained implied that BLG was adsorbed faster than ALA. In the confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments, the different behaviour of ALA and BLG in the single-component system with regard to their penetration within the adsorbent beads suggested that the two proteins have different transport mechanisms governing their adsorption. The two-component system results showed that ALA was able to displace BLG in spite of the lower affinity of the former protein to the adsorbent. The packed-bed adsorption and elution of a mixture of ALA and BLG were then investigated under the above conditions but using a 5 -ml column. BLG breakthrough occurred first, and its concentration in the outlet exceeded its feed value by 1. 6 fold before declining to the feed value, followed by the breakthrough of ALA. ALA displaced and eluted all the BLG from the column in a pure form. Pure ALA could then be eluted with good recovery. The single- and two-component breakthrough curves for ALA and BLG were simulated by the simple kinetic model using the isotherm parameters, but the overshoot phenomenon could only be predicted after correcting these parameters. The evidence of the competitive nature of adsorption observed in binary mixtures was used to develop a facile separation procedure for the two proteins from aqueous solutions of whey concentrate powders. A novel consecutive two-stage separation process was developed to separate ALA and BLG from whey concentrate mixtures. Almost all the BLG in the feed was recovered, with 78 % being recovered at 95 % purity and a further 20 % at 86 % purity. In addition, 67 % of ALA was recovered, 48 % at 54 % purity and 19 % at 60 % purity. The correction factors employed for the pure binary mixture were used to simulate the breakthrough curves of the two proteins in experiments conducted with whey concentrate in each of the two stages of the novel separation process, and there was agreement between the experimental and theoretical results.

40|$|In this study, the adsorptive {{removal of}} selenium(IV) and selenium(VI) from water by a newly {{developed}} ion exchange adsorbent, based on Fe(III) and Mn(III) hydrous oxides, was examined. This {{study was conducted}} to determine the influence of various operating parameters, such as initial anion concentration, contact time, adsorbent dose, pH, solution temperature, and the presence of competitive anions, on the treatment performance. The high Se(IV) adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent (up to 41. 02 mg/g at pH 4) was due to its high affinity for selenite, as reflected in the fast rate of <b>uptake</b> (<b>batch</b> studies) and an efficient long-term removal (column experiments). Although adsorption of anions traditionally decreases as pH increases, the mixed adsorbent was capable of purifying large volumes of Se(IV) -containing water (at pH 7) to reach concentrations lower than 10 lg/L, which meets the European Commission standards. The presence of sulphate and carbonate did not influence Se(IV) adsorption. However, high phosphate and silicate concentrations may have decreased the removal efficiency of Se(IV). Data from the batch and column adsorption experiments were fitted with a number of approved models, which revealed the adsorption mechanism and allowed for a comparison of the results...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{model for}} {{anaerobic}} phosphorus release and aerobic <b>uptake</b> <b>batch</b> test was constructed based on ASM 2 d and analyzed with sensitivity analysis. And it was simulated with estimated parameters. The phosphorus behaviors were mainly {{influenced by the}} initial concentration of soluble COD (SA) in anaerobic condition and PHA (XPHA) in aerobic conditions, respectively. Sensitivity analysis suggested the procedure to estimate model parameters and it includes 1) phosphorus release in anaerobic and organic-rich condition, 2) addition of sufficient phosphorus to ensure PHA-poor condition and 3) subsequent phosphorus uptake in aerobic PHA-poor condition. Genetic algorithms was used for model parameter estimation, and its applicability was verified by estimating predetermined parameters of simulation data. The measured and estimated parameters are XPAO, XPP, XPHA, qPHA and YPO 4 in anaerobic condition and qPHA, µPAO and YPHA in aerobic condition assuming that the other parameters were fixed to suggested values. Finally, experimental behavior of phosphorus was used for estimating parameters and {{it was concluded that}} XPAO= 1450 mg/L, XPP= 54. 4 mg/L XPHA= 206 mg/L at the end of anaerobic condition, qPHA= 3. 51 1 /day and YPO 4 = 0. 264 and qPHA= 0. 967 1 /day, µPAO= 1. 25 1 /day and YPHA= 0. 721, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The new {{nanocomposite}} of NaP-Hydroxyapatite (NaP:HAp) {{has been}} developed for removal of fluoride from aqueous solution. NaP:HAp nanocomposite has been characterized by using different method such as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), surface area (BET) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Box–Behnken design with three-level and four-factor has been employed for determination of effective process parameters such as solution pH (4 – 11), temperature (25 – 55 ° C), initial adsorbent dose (1 – 3  g) and initial fluoride concentration (5 – 25  mg/L) on removal of fluoride from aqueous solution. After 29 batch runs, Quadratic model was established by regression analysis of the experimental data obtained from 29 <b>batch</b> runs. Quantity <b>uptake</b> of fluoride was evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) models. The rate of adsorption was rapid and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics for this adsorbent. Moreover, thermodynamic parameters (ΔΗ°, ΔG°, ΔS°) for fluoride sorption on NaP:HAp nanocomposite was also studied from the temperature dependence. The significant novelty of this work is the simple preparation of a new nanocomposite from Hydroxyapatite and zeolite that increased stability of HAp in different pH and temperature. Also, this nanocomposite shows high capacity for adsorption of fluoride related of other sorbent and reusable for several times that makes this method nearly green and friendly environmentally...|$|R

In this study, used brewers draff, peat moss, sawdust, grape stalks and husks were investigated as novel biosorbents for Cr(VI). The material was tested in two different modifications. The material was dried, cut and sieved and part of it was subjected to acid (2 M H 2 SO 4) and alkali (0. 5 M NaOH) pre-treatments to remove starch, proteins and sugars. Fourier transform infrared rays analysis on solid phase (FTIR-ATR) was used to determine the main functional groups that might control the metal <b>uptake.</b> <b>Batch</b> experiments were performed at different pH values (3, 4. 5, 6) and at various initial concentration of Cr(VI) (25 – 2012; 250 mg L− 1). Two equilibrium empirical models, Langmuir and Freundlich, were used to describe Cr(VI) adsorption. In order to identify possible reduction processes, ion exchange separation on the AG 1 -X 8 resin was used to separate the anionic Cr(VI) and the reduced cationic Cr(III) from the aqueous phase after biosorption. As expected, Cr(VI) removal was pH-dependent and fitted well both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The ion exchange separation showed that Cr(VI) reduction had occurred in the solution during biosorption. The efficiency of draff as a biosorbent was comparable (or even higher) to highly organic materials (e. g., composted peat) showing its potential application for Cr(VI) decontamination...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of two bacteria, Arthrobacter viscosus and Streptococcus equisimilis, {{and the effect}} of the interaction of these bacteria with four different clays on the retention of diethylketone were investigated in <b>batch</b> experiments. The <b>uptake,</b> the removal percentages and the kinetics of the processes were determined. S. equisimilis,by itself, had the best performance in terms of removal percentage, for all the initial diethylketone concentrations tested: 200, 350 and 700 mg/L. The uptake values are similar for both bacteria. A possible mechanism to explain the removal of diethylketone includes its degradation by bacteria, followed by the adsorption of the intermediates/sub-products by the functional groups present on the cells surfaces. The assays performed with bacteria and clays indicated that the uptake values are similar despite of the clay used, for the same microorganism and mass of clay, but in general higher values are reached when S. equisimilis is used, compared to A. viscosus. Kinetic data were described by pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models.

40|$|Microthrix parvicella is the {{dominant}} filamentous microorganism prevailed in biological nutrient removal (BNR) activated sludge systems experiencing temporarily or even permanently filamentous bulking and foaming problems. Reports regarding the ability of M. parvicella to uptake and utilize long chain fatty acids (LCFA) are rather controversial. In {{the context of this}} study a series of carbon <b>uptake</b> <b>batch</b> experiments with oleate as the external substrate under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions were performed in order to investigate the biosorption capacity of activated sludge samples experiencing serious filamentous bulking and foaming problems due to M. parvicella proliferation. According to the results LCFA removal efficiency is reversely proportional to the applied organic loading. Removal efficiencies in the order of 70 - 90 % were observed under aerobic conditions for floc loadings lower than 100 mgCOD/gSS, whereas lower removal efficiencies were experienced (30 - 40 %) for significantly higher fl oc loadings. Similar correlation of removal efficiencies with floc loading was evidenced under anaerobic and anoxic conditions (50 % LCFA removal for floc loadings lower than 100 mgCOD/gSS). Based on these findings it can be stated that under the conditions prevailing in anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic selector tanks, only a portion of LCFA is removed, and therefore the remaining LCFA under the completely mixed conditions prevailing at the aeration zone of a bioreactor would establish low enough floc loadings, thus stimulating M. parvicella growth. © 2010 Desalination Publications.

40|$|A {{combined}} macroscopic and micro {{analytical approach}} was applied on two distinct barite samples from Ra <b>uptake</b> <b>batch</b> experiments using ToF-SIMS and detailed SEM investigations. The experiments {{were set up}} at near to equilibrium conditions in order to distinguish between two possible scenarios for the uptake of Ra by already existent barite, (1) formation of a Ba 1 -xRaxSO 4 solid solution surface layer on the barite or (2) a complete recrystallization, leading to homogenous Ba 1 -xRaxSO 4 crystals. It could be clearly shown that Ra uptake in all barite particles analyzed within this study {{is not limited to}} the surface but extends to the entire solid. For most grains a homogenous distribution of Ra could be determined, indicating a complete recrystallization of barite into a Ba 1 -xRaxSO 4 solid solution. The maxima of the Ra/Ba intensity ratio distribution histograms calculated from ToF-SIMS are identical with the expected Ra/Ba ratios calculated from mass balance assuming a complete recrystallization. In addition, the role of Ra during the recrystallization of barite was examined via detailed SEM investigations. Depending on the type of barite used, an additional coarsening effect or a strong formation of oriented aggregates was observed compared to blank samples without Ra. In conclusion, the addition of Ra to a barite at close to equilibrium conditions has a major impact on the system leading to a fast re-equilibration of the solid to a Ba 1 -xRaxSO 4 solid solution and visible effects on the particle size distribution, even at room temperature...|$|R
