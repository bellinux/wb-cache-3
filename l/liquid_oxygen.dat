5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first stage}} {{is to be}} powered by Blue Origin's BE-4 {{single-shaft}} oxygen-rich staged combustion <b>liquid</b> methane/liquid <b>oxygen</b> rocket engine while the second stage will be powered by the recently qualified BE-3 tap-off cycle <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> rocket engine. The number of engines powering each stage has not been released, nor has the payload or gross launch weight specifications. [...] No details were publicly released as of September 2015.|$|R
5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid {{air in a}} cryogenic air separation unit; a process that separates liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77.3K, from argon, which boils at 87.3K, and <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen,</b> which boils at 90.2K. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the American {{scientist}} Robert H. Goddard {{became the}} first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.|$|E
50|$|Lower rocket stages usually use {{high-density}} (low volume {{per unit}} mass) propellants {{due to their}} lighter tankage to propellant weight ratios and because higher performance propellants require higher expansion ratios for maximum performance than can be attained when operated in atmosphere. Thus, the Saturn V first stage used kerosene-liquid oxygen rather than the <b>liquid</b> hydrogen-liquid <b>oxygen</b> used on its upper stages. Similarly, the Space Shuttle used high-thrust, high-density solid rocket boosters for its lift-off with the <b>liquid</b> hydrogen-liquid <b>oxygen</b> Space Shuttle Main Engines used partly for lift-off but primarily for orbital insertion.|$|R
5000|$|A vacuum {{insulated}} evaporator (VIE) {{is a form}} of pressure vessel that allows the bulk storage of cryogenic <b>liquids</b> including <b>oxygen,</b> nitrogen and argon for industrial processes and medical applications.|$|R
50|$|Those plans {{called for}} the first stage to be powered by Blue Origin's BE-4 {{single-shaft}} oxygen-rich staged combustion <b>liquid</b> methane/liquid <b>oxygen</b> rocket engine while the second stage will be powered by the recently qualified BE-3 tap-off cycle <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> rocket engine. The number of engines powering each stage was not released, nor was the payload or gross launch weight specifications. Blue Origin intends to launch the rocket from the historic Launch Complex 36 and manufacture the rockets at a new facility on nearby land in Exploration Park. Acceptance testing of the BE-4 engines will also be done in Florida.|$|R
5|$|The {{facility}} {{would have}} incorporated a <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> factory and a bomb-proof train station to allow missiles and supplies {{to be delivered}} from production facilities in Germany. It was constructed using the labour of thousands of prisoners of war and forcibly conscripted workers used as slave labourers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{oxidizer}} {{and main}} fuel valves control {{the flow of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each engine controller. When an engine is operating, the main valves are fully open.|$|E
5|$|In the Space Shuttle {{the main}} {{oxidizer}} and fuel bleed valves were used after shutdown to dump any residual propellant, with residual <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> venting through {{the engine and}} residual liquid hydrogen venting through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves. After the dump was completed, the valves closed and remain closed {{for the remainder of}} the mission.|$|E
50|$|The RS-83 was {{a rocket}} engine {{design for a}} {{reusable}} <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> rocket larger and more powerful than any other. The RS-83 was designed to last 100 missions, and was intended for use on {{the first stage of}} a two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle.|$|R

50|$|In January 2013, {{the company}} {{announced}} {{the development of the}} Blue Engine-3 BE-3, a new <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> (LH2/LOX) cryogenic engine. The engine was originally announced to produce 100000 lbf kN thrust, with initial thrust chamber tests planned for mid-February 2013 at NASA Stennis. The thrust chamber tests were run sometime in 2013.|$|R
5|$|The NFPA 704 {{standard}} rates {{compressed oxygen}} gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> (LOX) {{is given a}} health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings {{are the same as}} the compressed gas form.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E

5000|$|The {{production}} and transport of cryogenic fuels (<b>liquid</b> hydrogen and <b>oxygen)</b> {{as well as}} the long-term storage of these fluids is necessary for the space industry.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1959 {{a change}} request was {{received}} from ARPA {{to upgrade the}} upper stage to a much more powerful design using four new 20000 lbf kN <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> powered engines in a larger-diameter 160" [...] second stage, with an upgraded Centaur using two engines of the same design for the third stage.

5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroc missile used <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> as its oxidizer, {{and alcohol}} for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile very fragile because it required continuous pressurization.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
50|$|Blue Origin {{publicly}} {{announced the}} development of the Blue Engine 3, or BE-3, in January 2013, but the engine had begun development in the early 2010s. BE-3 is a new <b>liquid</b> hydrogen/liquid <b>oxygen</b> (LH2/LOX) cryogenic engine that can produce 110000 lbf kN of thrust at full power, and can be throttled down to as low as 25000 lbf kN for use in controlled vertical landings.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 Claude devised what is {{now known}} as the Claude system for {{liquifying}} air. The system enabled the production of industrial quantities of <b>liquid</b> nitrogen, <b>oxygen,</b> and argon; Claude's approach competed successfully with the earlier system of Carl von Linde (1895). Claude and businessman Paul Delorme founded L'Air Liquide, S.A. (Air Liquide), which is presently a large multinational corporation headquartered in Paris, France.|$|R
50|$|In September 4, 2013 an {{agreement}} {{has been reached}} between the Applied Research Laboratory and NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The laboratory created the Space Systems Initiative which would allow the space center to provide bipropellant rockets and <b>liquid</b> methane/liquid <b>oxygen</b> control engines with the university to enabling students {{to gain a better}} understanding of rocket performance. Data and results would be shared with NASA.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{first major}} refit started in December 1967 and {{continued}} until February 1969, {{during which she}} was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. The modifications cost A$8.5million, and included {{an overhaul of the}} hull and machinery, strengthening of the flight deck, improvements to the catapult and arrestor cables, modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements, and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar. Air conditioning systems and a <b>liquid</b> <b>oxygen</b> generation plant were also installed. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May. This was the largest project undertaken by Garden Island Dockyard to that date.|$|E
25|$|The shuttle's main {{fuel tank}} {{is covered in}} thermal {{insulation}} foam intended to prevent ice from forming when the tank is full of <b>liquid</b> hydrogen and <b>oxygen.</b> Such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off.|$|R
