5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed; therefore, storms that <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACE ratings.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected {{with a low}} cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 30, the third lowest value {{at the time}} and the lowest since 1864.

5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 230, the fourth highest value on record, behind only the 1893, 2005, and 1933 seasons. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that <b>last</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> such as the fourth hurricane, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, such as the Miami hurricane and Havana, have high ACEs.

25|$|The {{treatment}} of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet.
