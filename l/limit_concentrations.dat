Rate constants of hydrolysis of the P-N bond in guanosine 5 '-monophosphate 2 -methylimidazolide (2 -MeImpG) and in guanosine 5 '-monophosphate imidazolide (ImpG), kh, have been determined in the presence/absence of magnesium ion as a function of temperature and polycytidylate [poly(C) ] concentration. Using the rate constant of hydrolysis of 2 -MeImpG and the rate constant of elongation, i. e., the reaction of an oligoguanylate with 2 -MeImpG in the presence of poly(C) acting as template, the <b>limiting</b> <b>concentration</b> of 2 -MeImpG necessary for oligonucleotide elongation to compete with hydrolysis can be calculated. The <b>limiting</b> <b>concentration</b> is defined as the initial concentration of monomer that results in its equal consumption by hydrolysis and by elongation. These <b>limiting</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 2 -MeImpG are found to be 1. 7 mM at 37 degrees C and 0. 36 mM at 1 degrees C.

40|$|Both new {{guidelines}} concerning elemental impurity <b>limit</b> <b>concentrations</b> and novel analytical procedures for elemental analysis of pharmaceutical substances are being {{adopted by the}} United States Pharmacopeia (USP). This paper outlines the optimization of two sample preparation procedures for organic pharmaceutical excipient products, one relying on direct dissolution in an aqueous medium and another on microwave-assisted acid digestion. Optimization particularly involved the stabilization and reliable determination of Hg, Pd and Os. Analyte concentrations and spike recoveries were determined in two organic pharmaceutical excipients using a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument equipped with a collision–reaction cell. Aqueous dissolution was achieved with 0. 009 mMKBrO 3 in 1 % (v/v) HNO 3 and 1 % (v/v) HCl and microwave-assisted acid digestion was performed with aqua regia. Polyatomic interferences originally hampering the accurate determination of 51 V, 52 Cr, 53 Cr, 55 Mn, 56 Fe and 75 As were eliminated through introduction of He/H 2 collision–reaction gas at a flow rate of 4. 5 – 5. 1 ml min- 1 and applying a kinetic energy barrier of 3 V between the hexapole collision–reaction cell and the quadrupole analyzer. Limits of detection {{were more than a}} factor of ten lower than the proposed <b>limit</b> <b>concentrations</b> for parenteral administration and the impurity concentrations in the products tested never exceeded the <b>limit</b> <b>concentrations</b> defined by USP. Elemental spike recoveries ranged between 93. 8 and 109. 9 % when standard addition was used for calibration, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 12. 7 %.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the built {{environment}} on public health is complex, involving several determinants of health including indoor air quality. People who spend the most time indoors can be exposed to indoor air pollutants {{for long periods of}} time. These are often the same people who are most susceptible to adverse effects if exposures are high enough (young children, elderly, and chronically ill, especially those suffering from respiratory diseases). An analysis of data on selected indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from community studies in Alberta, Canada was undertaken. Measures of typical (central tendency) and high end (upper limit) indoor concentrations were estimated from seven studies in Alberta. Best estimates of central tendency indoor concentrations for 12 VOCs—benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, 3 -methylhexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene—were less than 5 µg/m 3. Best estimates of central tendency indoor concentrations for three VOCs—toluene, m/p-xylene, and limonene—were greater than 5 µg/m 3. In the case of best estimates of upper limit indoor concentrations—benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, hexane, 3 -methylhexane, heptane, octane, nonane, carbon tetrachloride, and tetrachloroethylene had upper <b>limit</b> <b>concentrations</b> less than 15 µg/m 3. Best estimates of upper limit indoor concentrations for toluene, m/p xylene, decane, limonene, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene were greater than 15 µg/m 3. Upper <b>limit</b> <b>concentrations</b> observed inside Alberta residences were about 4 to 10 times higher than typical concentrations for most of the VOCs observed.
