50|$|The real {{question}} is: {{are we to}} believe that witchcraft occurred in a given situation simply because of what the witches claim? No: {{it is clear that}} the witches are not to be believed, and the judges should not pass sentence on anyone unless the case can be proven with external and objective evidence sufficient to convince everyone who hears it. And who can accept the following: that a person can frequently fly through the air and travel a hundred leagues in an hour; that a woman can get through a space not big enough for a fly; that a person can make himself invisible; that he can be in a river or the open sea and not get wet; or that he can be in bed at the sabbath at the same time;... and that a witch can turn herself into any shape she fancies, be it housefly or raven?

5000|$|In 1922, Prince Eitel sued four German {{newspapers}} {{over what}} he considered libelous allegations {{that his wife had}} committed adultery.

In the case, she stated that she had known the defendant {{for a number of years}} before her marriage when he served her father in Oldenburg. When asked by the judge, she said [...] "our intimate relations continued even after my marriage with the Kaiser's son". She also added that her husband was aware of the affair the entire time, and that her and Plettenberg's intimate relationship only ceased once he married. Sophia Charlotte later announced however, [...] "I emphatically deny that either before or after have I had any unpermitted relations whatever with the plaintiff. I not only never committed adultery with the plaintiff nor did we ever kiss each other, nor did I maintain any relations whatsoever with him which overstepped the <b>limits</b> <b>permitted</b> by good society".

5000|$|In a {{subsequent}} {{report to the}} Supreme Council in 1613, Salazar severely criticized the procedure of the tribunal during the witchcraft outbreak, not even disclaiming his own responsibility. The inquisitors had failed to keep proper records, writing only the resolution of each point, and thus suppressing inconsistencies; they had concealed {{the fact that the}} accused were permitted to retract confessions; those retractions which had occurred were sometimes omitted from the records, in the hope they would be withdrawn. The inquisitors had also tacitly accepted violence used against the accused by local authorities. The real question, Salazar said, was whether one should believe witchcraft occurred simply because of what accused witches claim. In his view, they were not to be believed, since they alleged impossible things such as flying through the air, attendance at the witches’ gathering {{at the same time that}} they were in bed, and self-transformation into different shapes. [...] "These claims go beyond all human reason and many even pass the <b>limits</b> <b>permitted</b> the devil", he concluded.

5000|$|Though counted by Don Javier amongst [...] "camaradas" [...] of {{the treacherous}} Rodezno, Bilbao {{did not follow}} his course of {{approaching}} Don Juan as the legitimate Carlist claimant. Instead, together with other Traditionalists like Joaquín Bau, Iturmendi or del Burgo, in 1943 he re-launched the candidature of Karl Pius Habsburg, styled as Carlos VIII and, within the <b>limits</b> <b>permitted</b> by the Francoist regime, he cautiously supported Carloctavismo until the claimant unexpectedly died in 1953. When in mid-1950s Carlism changed its strategy towards Francoism from opposition to cautious collaboration, the distance between Bilbao and the party shortened. The new breed of Carlist activists, especially the young anti-Traditionalist entourage of Don Javier's son, Carlos Hugo, were keen to use Bilbao in their own gamble for power. Though they despised Bilbao as traitor, in 1959 the group invited him to join Junta Directiva Central, a front-office sheltering their semi-political initiatives, like Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella or the Azada y asta periodical.Most probably the senile Bilbao {{was unaware of the}} power struggle already rife within Carlism, with reactionary Traditionalists confronted by the socialist Progressists. In 1963 as the Cortes speaker he sent a greeting telegram to the Carlist annual amassment at Montejurra, at that time serving as key event in the hugocarlista bid for power and as promotional stage for Carlos Hugo himself. Already a political retiree and faced with perspective of Juan Carlos declared the future king, in 1969 Bilbao observed {{that it would not be}} intelligent to stumble twice over the same stone; a year before death he voiced in favor of Don Javier. The only notable Carlist present on his funeral was José Luis Zamanillo.|$|E

5000|$|The major stunt {{scenes were}} {{executed}} before the camera with no miniatures, no blue screens, while mostly being shot at night. Completed during May 1990, the centerpiece stunt {{of the film}} involved a Mercedes-Benz convertible driving through the fourth floor window of an exploding warehouse. For the scene, a 1,500 pound Mercedes auto mock-up was connected by 150 feet of quarter-inch pulleyed cable to a Ford 4×4 pickup on the ground. The truck would drive straight ahead and pull the Mercedes through the windows as the cable that connected the two vehicles exhibited a tensile strength of 8,000 pounds. Once the pull on the cable started, both vehicles would move in precise proportion to one another. After the mock-up launched through the windows, the hook connecting the Mercedes would drop. As Frazier explained, [...] "The hook {{is very similar to}} the kind used to launch jets on aircraft carriers, ... Once the hook falls away, the Mercedes is propelled by its own momentum." [...] Aerodynamics {{played a key role in}} the execution, as Frazier referred to the stunt saying, [...] "When the car left the building it was very important that it exit and travel flat, ... A lot of times it doesn't matter. In this case, if the car didn't travel flat, you would know that the car could not have survived into the next sequence where it landed on the rooftop. We had to set up aerodynamics on that car, so that every time it went out the window, including the tests, it flew out without the nose dipping down."

5000|$|In September-October 1930, Beck was {{a leading}} defence witness at the trial in Leipzig of three junior officers, Lieutenant Richard Scheringer, Hans Friedrich Wendt and Hanns Ludin. The three men were charged with {{membership}} in the Nazi Party; at that time membership in political parties was forbidden {{for members of the}} Reichswehr. The three officers admitted to Nazi Party membership, and used as their defence the claim that the Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to Reichswehr personnel. When the three officers were arrested after being caught red-handed distributing Nazi literature at their base, Beck, who was the commanding officer of the 5th Artillery Regiment based in Ulm, to which the three Nazi officers belonged, was highly furious and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good that Reichswehr personnel should not be banned from joining the Nazi Party. At the preliminary hearing, Beck spoke on behalf of the three officers. At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck testified as to the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life, and proclaimed his belief that the Reichswehr ban on Nazi Party membership in his opinion should be rescinded. When Lieutenant Scheringer spoke of a future war in which the Nazi Party and the Reichswehr were to fight hand in hand as brothers in a [...] "war of liberation" [...] to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles, Beck supported Scheringer by testifying that: [...] "The Reichswehr is told daily that it is an army of leaders. What is a young officer to understand by that?". Historians such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett have noted that Beck was deliberately distorting Hans von Seeckt's Führerarmee ("Army of leaders" [...] i.e. training soldiers to be leaders when the time came to expand the Army beyond the <b>limits</b> <b>permitted</b> by Versailles) principle by seeking to apply it to politics. During the course of the 1930 Leipzig trial, Beck first met Adolf Hitler who also testified at the trial, and was very favourably impressed.|$|E
5000|$|The parish {{church of}} St. Mary and St. Bartholomew has a chancel, nave with narrow aisles, west tower, south porch, and north vestry. The chancel is of about mid 12th-century date. It is {{comparatively}} long and narrow for the period, {{in a church}} of this size, and it has an unusual north doorway near the west end; {{it is possible that}} it represented the complete church, at least for a short time. The nave, if not coeval, was built soon afterwards and had a late-12th-century south aisle, of which the arcade remains. Possibly the nave was of the same width as the chancel, but was widened to the north about 5 ft. about the middle of the 13th century and a narrow north aisle and arcade added. The chancel arch was widened {{at the same time to}} the utmost <b>limits</b> <b>permitted</b> by the width of the chancel. For some reason, probably weakness, the north aisle was rebuilt late in the 14th century on the old foundations of the narrow aisle. This was followed by a similar rebuilding of the south aisle early in the 15th century, again without widening it. About the same time the west tower was begun, but carried up only a short way, the completion being delayed until late in the century.The last medieval alteration was the building of the clearstory in the 16th century in place of the old steeply pitched roof indicated by the lines on the tower.The tower bore a tall spire [...] "till by the extraordinary violence of lightning and thunder happening on St.Andrew's Day, in the night, in the year 1643, it was cloven, and fell to the ground: at which time the whole fabrick, with the tower, were torn in divers places." [...] The south porch and north vestry are modern, and various repairs and restorations have been executed to other parts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1879 with the old material overseen by the architect W. E. Nesfield.All the roofs are modern.|$|E
