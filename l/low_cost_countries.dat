40|$|Many Swedish {{manufacturing}} companies expand their production to <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> <b>countries</b> through {{different types of}} foreign direct investments {{in an attempt to}} reduce costs. Mexico is one of these <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> <b>countries</b> and is becoming a more and more feasible alternative to Swedish companies. The reasons for this lie in different country specific factors such as closeness to the US, the Maquiladora industry and of course the low labour costs.

This dissertation presents different Mexico specific factors to consider before an expansion such as education level, the Mexican business culture and infrastructure.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{strategic}} trade policy under integrated markets is presented and optimal trade policies are derived under assumptions of both complete and incomplete information. With {{the assumption of}} complete information it is shown that the optimal policy is an import tariff (export subsidy) when a country is a net importer (exporter). In the Nash equilibrium in trade policies the <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> <b>country</b> gives an export subsidy which is fully countervailed by the import tariff of the other country. The introduction of incomplete information about costs adds an incentive for both governments to use their trade policy as a signal of their firm's costs. This signalling effect increases the export subsidy and decreases the import tariff. In the simultaneous signalling game, with symmetry, the expected welfare in the separating equilibrium is higher than under free trade for both countries...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{constructed}} in which multinational firms may arise endogenously. Multinationals exist in equilibrium when transport and tariff costs are high, incomes are high, and firm-level scale economies are important relative to plant-level scale economies. Less obvious, multinationals {{are more important}} in total economic activity when countries are more similar in incomes, relative factor endowments, and technologies. The model may thus be useful in explaining several stylized facts, including (a) the growing importance of direct investment relative to trade among the developed countries over time and (b) the greater ratio of investment to trade among the developed countries relative to this ratio for 'north-south' or 'south-south' economic relationships. The model offers predictions about the volume of trade that contrast {{with those of the}} 'new trade theory', predicting that trade at first rises and then falls as countries converge in incomes, relative endowments, and technologies. Welfare is also considered, and it is shown that direct investment makes the smaller (or high <b>cost)</b> <b>country</b> better off, but may make the larger (or <b>low</b> <b>cost)</b> <b>country</b> worse off. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Pursuit of {{globalization}} strategy for both market penetration and cost reduction {{is a common}} trend. This paper is addressing some of the implications and management of cost reduction strategies. As the market becomes more competitive, manufacturers are taking steps to move sourcing and manufacturing to <b>Low</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>Countries</b> (LCCs). A global telecommunications company sources almost 90 % of the total purchases from Asia, and China contributes to 90 % of the Asian procurement bill. While this reduces the per-piece price of the product, it increases the planning and logistical complexities in-terms of increased lead-times and planning horizons. At the same time, for similar reasons, customers have become more demanding and are increasingly looking out for shorter delivery lead times. Presently, outsourcing is a norm fo...|$|E

Outsourcing and offshoring are strategies often employed by organisations to sustain and gain such competitive advantage. This paper focuses on evaluating the factors that influence the selection of <b>Low</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>Countries</b> (LCCs) for outsourcing and offshoring. It also ranks a group of seven LCCs to determine the best locations to emigrate manufacturing operations. To do this, the most influential factors for outsourcing and offshoring are identified and weighted based on their importance. Then, these factors are evaluated based on the degree of development in the studied LCCs. The study indicates that Taiwan, Indian and China are the best top options for manufacturing organisations to outsource/offshore their operations...|$|E
