25|$|Windows Vista {{contains}} a new networking stack, which brings large improvements {{in all areas}} of network-related functionality. It includes a native implementation of IPv6, as well as complete overhaul of IPv4. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components, services, and the user interface. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the <b>Link</b> <b>Local</b> Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration settings that enables more dynamic control and does not require a computer restart after settings are changed. The new stack is also based on a strong host model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that can be dynamically inserted and removed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{traces of}} Denton Colliery {{can still be}} found. The {{colliery}} offices, situated on Stockport Road, still stand and are now the showroom of a company of monumental stonemasons. Behind the office building is a small section of wall from the colliery. On {{the opposite side of}} the road and slightly nearer to Crown Point is the building that once housed the local mines rescue station, now two private houses. Two miners cottages, much altered and now converted into one house, stand near the junction of Stockport Road and Cemetery Road. The foundations of Hulmes Pit were excavated during the early 1970s and can still be seen. Parts of the track bed of the tramway to Denton Colliery can still be traced, both on modern maps and on the ground, as can traces of a canal, known as the Beat Bank Branch, intended to <b>link</b> <b>local</b> collieries to the Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal at Reddish, which was partially built and then abandoned.|$|E

For this, they took an uninspired international hotel cuisine based on imported products and replaced it with a cuisine based on locally grown foods.|$|E
