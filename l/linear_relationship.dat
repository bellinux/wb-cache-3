40|$|Predictors of a {{multiple}} linear regression equation selected by GCV (Generalized Cross Validation) may contain undesirable predictors with no <b>linear</b> functional <b>relationship</b> with the target variable, but are chosen only by accident. This is because GCV estimates prediction error, but does not control the probability of selecting irrelevant predictors of the target variable. To take this possibility into account, a new statistics “GCVf” (“f”stands for “flexible”) is suggested. The rigidness in accepting predictors by GCVf is adjustable; GCVf is a natural generalization of GCV. For example, GCVf is designed so {{that the possibility of}} erroneous identification of <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> is 5 percent when all predictors have no <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> with the target variable.

40|$|Measuring the {{difference}} between the measured hydrocarbon thickness in an observation well and the actual hydrocarbon thickness in a formation has been a major hinderance in estimating the volume of free product in aquifers. The thickness of hydrocarbons in some observation wells is as much as four times greater than in the formation. A three-dimensional sandbox model was used to determine <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> between the height of hydrocarbon in an observation well to the thickness of hydrocarbon above the water table. A fine-grained sand was used to calibrate the system, then two soils were characterized and modeled. The results of the sand and natural soil runs were compared with three models found in the literature. The <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> developed from the sandbox experiments compared favorably with the models in the literature.

25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a <b>linear</b> <b>relationship.</b> In the third case (bottom left), the <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient, even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E

As {{the boiling point}} of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, {{it should not be}} a surprise that the boiling point has almost a <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule.

25|$|The diverse {{material}} behavior {{of different types}} of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. Molecular weight and crystallinity are having the biggest impact, the crystallinity in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. The crystallinity is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within crystallites polyethylene has a density of 1.0nbsp&g·cm−3, in the amorphous regions of 0.86nbsp&g·cm−3. Thus, an almost <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> exists between density and crystallinity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSaturated, isotropic, poroelastic {{materials}} are classically described by their elastic stiffness, one Biot coefficient and one Biot modulus (Coussy 2010; Dormieux, Molinari, and Kondo 2002). The situation becomes more complex for unsaturated, isotropic, poroelastic materials that require multiple Biot coefficients and moduli (Coussy and Brisard 2009). These poroelastic coefficients are dependent and linked by several <b>linear</b> <b>relationships.</b> Micromechanical estimates of these coefficients {{have been proposed}} by several authors (Ulm, Constantinides, and Heukamp 2004; Pichler and Hellmich 2010). However, these estimates may fail to fulfill the <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> that relate the exact poroelastic coefficients. This might be regarded as an undesirable inconsistency of the model. In this work, we propose new, consistent (in {{the sense that the}} above mentioned <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> are preserved) estimates of the poroelastic coefficients. Our point of departure is the principle of Hashin and Shtrikman, suitably extended to eigenstressed materials (Bornert et al. 2001). Adopting stress-polarization fields that are similar to the eigenstress-free case (Willis 1977; Ponte Castañeda andWillis 1995) allows us to derive variational estimates of the poroelastic coefficients, which can be shown to fulfill all known <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> required from the exact values. After outlining the derivation within the general framework of eigenstressed, heterogeneous materials, the results will be specialized to poroelasticity. This will lead to a variational justification of the ad-hoc pore isodeformation assumption (Coussy and Brisard 2009) ...|$|R

25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E

Furthermore, the observation that the rate of IR-ligand dissociation is accelerated upon addition of unbound ligand implies that the nature of this cooperation is negative; said differently, that the initial binding of ligand to the IR inhibits further binding to its second active site - exhibition of allosteric inhibition.|$|E
25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> between the steady-state strain rate and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), grain boundary sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic phonons are {{coherent}} {{movements of}} atoms of the lattice {{out of their}} equilibrium positions. If the displacement is {{in the direction of}} propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name acoustic). Displacement perpendicular to the propagation direction is comparable to waves in water. If the wavelength of acoustic phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero energy. Acoustic phonons exhibit a <b>linear</b> <b>relationship</b> between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of acoustic phonons tend to zero with longer wavelength.

Korean pine samples were collected from eight sites located at different latitudes, and the following factors were determined for each site: geographic factors-latitude, longitude, and altitude; temperature factors-mean annual temperature (MAT), growth season mean temperature (GST), and mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM); and moisture factors-annual precipitation (AP), growth season precipitation (GSP), and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The Korean pine functional traits examined were specific leaf area (SLA), leaf thickness (LT), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific root length (SRL), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), root nitrogen content (RNC), and root phosphorus content (RPC). The results showed that Korean pine functional traits were significantly correlated to latitude, altitude, GST, MTCM, AP, GSP, and PET. Among the Korean pine functional traits, SLA showed significant <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> with LT, LDMC, LNC, LPC, and RPC, and LT showed significant <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> with LDMC, SRL, LNC, LPC, RNC, and RPC; the <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> between LNC, LPC, RNC, and RPC were also significant. In conclusion, Korean pine functional trait responses to latitude resulted in its adaptation to geographic and climatic factors. The main limiting factors were precipitation and evapotranspiration, followed by altitude, latitude, GST, and MTCM. The impacts of longitude and MAT were not obvious. Changes in precipitation and temperature were most responsible for the close correlation among Korean pine functional traits, reflecting its adaption to habitat variation...|$|R

Identifiable time series properties are found for the coefficients describing the <b>linear</b> <b>relationships</b> to the style scores. Contrary to traditional models, return relationships are also shown for some of the second order and interaction effects for a large fraction of the cross-sections.
