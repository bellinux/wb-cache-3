As a result the lowest success of first service has been achieved at a lactation (ranged) between 9 000 and 11 000 kg. The time between calving and the following first service varied according to the first disease in <b>last</b> <b>lactation.</b> With rising milk yield the frequency of diseases and the success of first service tend to decrease. Cows achieving a 305 day milk yield of more than 11 000 kg showed with 56 % the lowest frequency of diseases. In average 60 % of all dairy cows need to be treated once in a lactation. The diseases of highest prevalence are in the field of reproductive fertility and udder health.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the genetic variability of the mid-infrared prediction of lactoferrin content in milk (pLF) in Holstein first-parity cows. Variance components were estimated by Average Information Restricted Maximum Likelihood using a single-trait test-day random regression animal model. The dataset included 395, 287 test-day records from 67, 178 cows in 1190 herds from the Walloon Region of Belgium. Average pLF was 164. 89. mg/L and the standard deviation was 76. 07. mg/L. Frequency distribution for pLF was slightly asymmetrical, and pLF seemed to increase almost linearly all along the first lactation after a sharp decrease in early lactation. Genetic variance of pLF increased with days in milk within lactation while the permanent environmental variance was the highest in early lactation, then decreased to become lower than genetic variance at 50 days in milk, and finally increased in the <b>last</b> <b>lactation</b> stages. The pLF was a moderately heritable trait. Daily heritability of pLF was the lowest at 5 days in milk (0. 19), then increased to reach a maximum at 260 days in milk (0. 44), and finally decreased for the last stages of lactation (0. 35 at 365 days in milk). Results from this study indicated that pLF is variable and heritable over the lactation and therefore it could be changed by genetic selection. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of these investigations {{was to examine}} possibilities for preventing fatty liver in cows during the peripartal period using the preparation HEPARENOL which includes methionine, lysine and choline in its composition. Investigations were performed on cattle of the Holstein breed whose average production during their <b>last</b> <b>lactation</b> was 8120 liters. The cows included in the experiment were divided into three groups of 10 cows each. Cows of the first group were administered the preparation HEPARENOL perorally 5 - 7 days before partus in daily doses of 50 ml per animal, and then daily during the first seven days after parturition in daily doses of 100 ml per animal. The second group of cows were administered the preparation {{in the same way}} as the first group, but they also received vitamin C injected deep i. m. in doses of 1000 mg per animal per day. The third group of cows were not exposed to any treatment and served as the control group. The body condition of the cows was marked according to the system Elanco Animal Health Bulletin Al 8478. Blood samples were taken by puncture of the jugular vein before the beginning of treatment, and on the third and 12 th days after partus. The glucose concentration was determined in the blood samples. On the 12 th day after partus, liver tissue samples were taken by biopsy for pathohistological examinations. Since the cows were fed in the same way and were in the same phase of the production-reproduction cycle, the average score of the body condition before treatment was approximately the same. However, on the 3 rd day after partus, cows of the second experimental group showed average values that were significantly lower in comparison with the other two groups of cows. It is very interesting that a significantly lower value of glycemia (x= 1. 93 ± 0. 34 mmol/l) was established in the same group of cows at this time. In cows of the first experimental and the control group, glycemia was approximately the same during the examined period. In cows of the second experimental group on the 12 th day after partus the glucose concentration significantly increased (x= 2. 42 ± 0. 58 mmol/l) against the values obtained for the 3 rd day, but it was still significantly lower in comparison with the glycemia of cows of the first experimental (x= 3. 34 ± 0. 61 mmol/l) and the control group (x= 3. 48 ± 0. 49 mmol/l). Practically, throughout the entire period glycemia was statistically significantly lower in the second experimental group in comparison with the other two groups of cows. The degree of fatty liver on the 12 th day postpartally, or five days after the end of treatment, was the lowest in cows of the second experimental group. In order to stress the differences, it is pointed out that there were two cows without fatty liver in the second group, while there were no such cows in the first experimental or in the control group. This group contained the smallest number of cows with a mean degree of fatty liver (n= 2), while two cows had very strong fatty liver. There were no differences between the control and the first experimental group in the number of cows with a mean degree of fatty liver, with the exception that the control group had two and the first experimental group one cow with a mild degree of fatty liver. It seems that treatment using the preparation HEPARENOL, or methionine, lysine and choline, before and after parturition did not have a significant effect on the incidence and degree of fatty liver. Only cows with additional and simultaneous treatment with vitamin C had a lower incidence and degree of morphological changes in the liver, in addition to the sigfnificant changes in body condition and the blood glucose concentration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine renal lipofuscinosis (BRL) is an {{incidental}} {{finding in}} cattle at slaughter. Condemnation of the kidneys as unfit {{for human consumption}} was until recently considered the only implication of BRL. Recent studies have indicated a negative influence on the health of affected animals. The present study investigated the prevalence, genetics and effect of BRL on milk yield and weight at slaughter. Methods BRL status of slaughter cattle was recorded at four abattoirs during a 2 -year-period. Data regarding breed, age, genetic descent, milk yield and weight at slaughter were extracted from the Danish Cattle Database. The prevalence of BRL was estimated stratified by breed and age-group. Furthermore, total milk yield, milk yield in <b>last</b> full <b>lactation</b> and weight at slaughter were compared for BRL-affected and non-affected Danish Holsteins and Danish Red cattle. Results 433, 759 bovines were slaughtered and 787 of these had BRL. BRL was mainly diagnosed in Danish Red, Danish Holstein and crossbreds. The age of BRL affected animals varied from 11 months to 13 years, but BRL was rarely diagnosed in cattle less than 2 years of age. The total lifelong energy corrected milk (ECM) yields were 3, 136 and 4, 083 kg higher for BRL affected Danish Red and Danish Holsteins, respectively. However, the median life span of affected animals was 4. 9 months longer, and age-corrected total milk yield was 1, 284 kg lower for BRL affected Danish Red cows. These cows produced 318 kg ECM less in their <b>last</b> full <b>lactation.</b> Weight at slaughter was not affected by BRL status. The cases occurred in patterns consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and several family clusters of BRL were found. Analysis of segregation ratios demonstrated the expected ratio for Danish Red cattle, but not for Danish Holsteins. Conclusion The study confirmed that BRL is a common finding in Danish Holsteins and Danish Red cattle at slaughter. The disorder is associated with increased total milk yield due to a longer production life. However, a reduced milk yield was detected in the end of the production life in Danish Red. The study supports that BRL is inherited autosomal recessively in the Danish Red breed and Danish Holsteins, but with incomplete penetrance of the genotype in Danish Holsteins. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} {{consists}} in investigating more closely {{the development of the}} body condition of dairy cows and heifers within the dry period or respectively the preparation period by the repeated, ultrasonographic measurement of the back fat thickness. For this 445 Holstein cows and 81 heifers from a major East German dairy cattle farm were examined at weekly intervals {{for the duration of the}} drying off or respectively of the preparation. Furthermore the recorded condition data were juxtaposed with the parameters of milk yield, fertility and animal health in the first lactation trimester. In addition the effects of a targeted condition correction were observed within the drying off of a group of cows. The body condition for the drying of the cows should amount to 20 - 25 mm of back fat thickness and be maintained approximately constant during the dry period. The duration of the dry period for dairy cows should be no longer than 50 days and the preparation period for cows and heifers no longer than 21 days. In the herd investigated the dry period fluctuated considerably and averaged 65 days. The preparation period for the cows averaged 22 days and for the heifers averaged 33 days. The proportion of animals below condition for the drying off was 44. 2 % and rose to 57. 0 % at the beginning of the preparation period. This development shows the inadequate energy supply in the early dry period. At the beginning of the preparation period the body condition of the cows rose slightly and in the last week befor calving the onset of the antepartal lipomobilisation was identifiable. After calving the fat mobilisation grew pronounced as expected. The change in the back fat thickness in this period investigated indicates a problem in the energy supply in the early dry period. The younger animals especially are not in a position to build up their fat reserves adequately by the end of the first lactation. Like the cows the heifers examined during the preparation period also exhibited a body condition sometimes far below the recommendations. From the results it becomes clear that condition problems can occur very specifically for the individual herd. On the basis of the current situation, the time and animal group are to be individually identified for problem-oriented body condition monitoring. The investigations carried out have shown that the assessment of body condition in the management of herds of dairy cows can provide important information on deficits in the energy supply to the animals at specific rearing stages. It is thus possible to activate the cows’ unused output reserves or also to recognise early the emergence of health risks in individual animals or groups of animals. In order to implement the body condition recommendations on drying off, a check on the body condition is necessary in the <b>last</b> <b>lactation</b> trimester. At-risk animals should be identified using specific characteristic figures (duration of lactation, probable calving date, milk output, age, condition state) and suitable measures be taken in good time. A further important point is the management of the drying off period. For this attention should be paid to adherence to the timing recommendations. The adequacy of energy supplies for the animals is to be checked, particularly for pasturing, and if necessary supplemented by the provision of TMR. An adequate condition of the heifers and young cows, even at the end of the lactation, should be aimed for in view of the bodily development still expected. A targeted correction of the body condition in the early dry period only leads to a very short term creation of body fat reserves and distinctly increases the activity of the peripartal lipolysis. Thus measures of this type are to be rejected in the dry period and the demand for an optimal body condition for drying off to be affirmed. The positive and negative properties for the dairy cow attributed to the bodyfat tissue have been confirmed in the results. Thus adequately laid down fat deposits have a positive effect on the milk yield and the fertility performance. The increased ketose rate of the better conditioned animals has to be assessed as a disadvantage. The negative influence of more intense peripartal lipolysis activity on the dry matter intake also becomes clear due to the changes in the blood serum parameters of these animals. The high proportion of cows (78. 6 %) with a serum calcium < 2. 2 mmol/l was noticeable. This result underlines the central role of hypocalcaemie in the transit period of the dairy cows. To summarise, in the dairy farm investigated it can be established that by further measures for optimal management of the dry period, reserves can be utilised for exploitation of the milk yield potential of the cows and heifers and also to improve the health of the animals. The regular assessment of the body condition should be a permanent component in herd management. Synchronous with breeding investigations, reliable figures are available for the assessment of the body condition with the ultrasonographic measurement of the back fat thickness, with only a small amount of extra outlay...|$|E

50|$|At birth, pups weigh 60-110 grams, and {{are blind}} {{and covered in}} short, dense, soft wool lacking guard hairs. Their eyes open after 9-10 days, with the teeth erupting after 14-16 days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10 days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones {{remaining}} only around the eyes. <b>Lactation</b> <b>lasts</b> for 45-60 days, though pups will begin eating food brought to them {{as early as the}} age of three weeks or one month. They reach their full growth at the age of 4.5 months. Pups will leave their parents in late August-September. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, will unite in pairs. Sexual maturity is reached at 8-10 months. Their longevity is largely unknown; animals 6-7 years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.|$|R
40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the trend of fatty acids during the lactation in donkey milk, six pluriparous Martina Franca donkeys, bred in an organic farm and fed with coarse hay and mix feed, were machine milked, every 28 days, from the 3 rd until to the 7 th month of lactation. The acidic composition of the individual milk samples was determined by GC-FID/MS and some ratios of nutritional interest and the atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI) indices were calculated. Data were submitted to ANOVA considering the variable: month of lactation. Results showed an decrease of the saturated fatty acids, an increase of the linolenic acid and of the unsaturated fatty acids and the best AI and TI during the 6 th and 7 th months of lactation, therefore an improvement of the dietetic and nutritional characteristics of the milk during the <b>last</b> phase of <b>lactation.</b> Results suggested that the month of lactation affects essential aspects of donkey milk as an alternative food for infancy...|$|R
40|$|Three feeding trials {{utilizing}} 185 sows (149 primiparous and 36 multiparous) {{were conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding various levels and sources of supplemental energy during lactation and from weaning to rebreeding on sow reproductive performance. Sows fed tallow (5 % or 10 %) during lactation had reproductive performance similar to sows fed the basal milo-soybean meal diet. Ad libitum feed intake was not affected {{by the addition of}} tallow for either the <b>last</b> week of <b>lactation</b> or for the entire three week lactation. However, daily digestible energy (DE) intake was increased with the addition of tallow to diets. Survival rate of pigs was not significantly affected by adding 5 % tallow for the entire lactation period. Adding extra energy (cornstarch or fat) to sow diets following weaning did not improve reproductive performance. However, sows on the higher energy diets tended to show estrus earlier than sows fed the basal diet...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the influence of pea and faba beans in the organic feeding of gilts and sows and phasing the lactation and gestation feeding on pregnant and lactating sows. The lactation feeding was phased by giving the sows more protein (rape seed expeller) at the <b>last</b> half of <b>lactation</b> (from 3 weeks lactation to weaning). The feeding of gestation was phased by replacing a part of the gestation feed with lactation feed at the last third of gestation. Experiment was carried out with 84 sows. The experiment was focused on sow feeding during lactation (n= 74 sows) as only a small number of the sows (n= 23) had results from the gestation period. MTT’s sow unit was closed at the end of 2013. The results from the gestation period have been calculated and reported but the data was too small to draw conclusions. The sows were devided to three experimental groups: control (19. 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection on production, reproduction and longevity in dairy cattle. The study population was a commercial Holstein dairy herd of approximately 400 milking cows. Cattle were tested for antibodies to BLV at least annually for three years and when culled. Four groups of culled cows were compared: seronegative cows (n = 79), seropositive cows without lymphocytosis (n = 176), seropositive cows with lymphocytosis (> or = 9, 000 lymphocytes/microliter) (n = 74), and seropositive cows with lymphosarcoma (n = 29). Seropositive groups of cows were bred more times and had longer calving intervals than seronegative cows. The seropositive groups had greater 305 -day ME (mature equivalent) FCM (3. 5 % fat-corrected milk) per lactation and were older when culled than seronegative cows. However, the percent fat per lactation was greater in seronegative cows. In the <b>last</b> complete <b>lactation,</b> differences in 305 -day ME FCM, days open and cull age between groups were reduced and none were significant (p > 0. 05). In the cull lactation, only cows with lymphocytosis had reduced milk production relative to seronegative cows, although this difference was not significant. After adjustment for initial production and reproductive values, only seropositive nonlymphocytotic cows were culled at a significantly older age than seronegative cattle. Lymphocytotic cows were culled four months younger on average than nonlymphocytotic seropositive cows. Hence, BLV infected cows had greater milk production on average than uninfected cows. Adverse effects of BLV infection were primarily limited to lymphocytotic cows which were culled earlier and had reduced milk production in the cull lactation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Holstein Friesian cross bred cow milk {{samples of}} {{different}} quarters in four stages of lactation {{were collected from}} dairy farms in the Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu and analyzed for composition and somatic cell count (SCC). No {{significant difference in the}} SCC was observed between quarters within the lactation stage. Count was significant between stages of lactation after the 2 nd stage. While data obtained in the <b>last</b> stage of <b>lactation</b> had the highest SCC. Significant (P< 0. 001) increase in SCC was estimated with advancing parity. The milk yield, SNF per cent tended to decrease, while the fat per cent and ash content tended to increase significantly with increase in the SCC as the lactation advances. It was concluded that the SCC {{can be used as a}} reliable indicator of udder health and milk composition for selecting the Holstein Friesian cows for milk production. When the SCC exceeds 5. 69 log 10 units per ml need for a course of antibiotic therapy should be ruled out to save the health of the udder...|$|R
40|$|Echidnas {{have a low}} {{metabolic}} rate, {{and energy}} expenditure is reduced even further {{by the use of}} torpor and hibernation. Thus echidnas appear to lie at the slow extreme of the fast-slow continuum, and this is reflected in many aspects of echidna life history: a long life, a long lactation period, and a single young which matures late. Reproductive activity occurs in mid-winter, shortly after arousal from hibernation. After a pregnancy of about 3 weeks the female lays a single egg into her pouch, which hatches after 10 – 11 days. Initially the young is incubated in the pouch before being left in the nursery burrow while the mother forages for ants, termites and other invertebrates. <b>Lactation</b> <b>lasts</b> for 150 - 200 days, the duration differing significantly between geographic regions. Growth rates during late lactation are very high, and, when weaned, the young has reached about 40 % of adult mass. The young loses mass before entering its first hibernation, which extends from early autumn to late spring. The young echidna reaches adult mass after about 3 - 5 years...|$|R
