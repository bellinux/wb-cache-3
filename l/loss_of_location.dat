In the nesting sites of many Xylocopa bee populations, destruction and removal of woody plants has caused the loss and extinction of those populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Selective {{recall of}} {{a subset of}} letters from a multiletter array declines {{systematically}} with increases in the delay of the partial report cue. The issues addressed were (a) whether such a decline is due to progressive <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information or to systematic loss of features and (b) whether partial report {{is the result of}} a select-then-identify or an identify-then-select process. Instructing the subjects to guess or not to guess had an effect of array, displacement, and extra-array errors. Emphasizing on recall location affected both intra- and extra-array errors. The interstimulus interval manipulation had an effect on extra-array errors as well as on intra-array errors. These observations are contrary to the suggestions that intra-array errors are due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information and that extra-array errors are indicative of a joint effect on misidentification due to chance and the ratio of extra-array errors to intra-array errors. Some other results are difficult for a dual-buffer model but can readily be accounted for by the orthodox view of the iconic store. THE INITIAL STAGE OF VISUAL PERCEPTION is generally characterized as a transient veridical representation. Some investigators have suggested that only sensory, noncategorical information such as location, shape, color, and size are available in the transient representation (Haber, 1969; Neisser, 1967; Sperling, 1960). Selective recall is achieved by choosing some parts of the veridical representation for further processing on the basis of sensory information (e. g., Sperling, 1960; Turvey & Kravetz, 1970; von Wright, 1968). This position is called the "select-then-identify" view...|$|E

The parameters which need to be estimated depend on the algorithms used in the online operating phase.

Crowdsourcing is an efficient way to conduct the site survey, but the measurements contributed by the suppliers will inevitably leak their location privacy.

40|$|The term {{localisation}} {{is derived}} from the word locale, which traditionally means a small area or vicinity. In ancient days, localisation meant navigation [...] an art of finding the way from one place to another. Tremendous advancement in the science of navigation dates back to the sixteenth century, when instruments like compasses, sextants and the first ever clock to keep the time exactly were devised. Advancement in navigation brought ways and means to explore the world, be it for expansion of the territories or for promoting trade and business. Since then localisation has been explored for several decades as a classical problem in many disciplines [...] including robotics, virtual reality, navigation. Now we are in the era of ubiquitous computing [...] a term coined by the visionary Mark Weiser in the early 1990 s. Weiser sees technology only as a means to an end, which should take a back seat in order to allow user to fully concentrate on the task at hand. Looking from a technological standpoint, today we are surrounded by a wealth of devices enriched with sensing, computing and communication capabilities which are seamlessly integrated in our daily lives. Knowing the location of an object is an important cornerstone and fertile research area in ubiquitous computing. The growing need of location systems underscores the importance of addressing this problem [...] government initiatives to locate emergency call by cellular network providers and the increasing usage of global positioning systems (GPS) in many commercial applications as in navigation are just a few examples. Since the field is active and vibrant, new services and market players are constantly emerging. Google have just launched a new service called Latitude, which lets smart phone and laptop users share their location with friends and allows those friends to share their locations in return. Latitude uses satellites and cell towers to estimate location. The market for GPS products and services alone is expected to grow to USD 200 billion by 2015. Real-time location systems (RTLS) in the transport and logistics sector drive the penetration of several location-based solutions. The number of RTLS suppliers is expected to increase from 50 to 200 by 2013, reflecting a market growth from USD 145 million in 2008 to USD 2. 7 billion in 2013. Despite the extraordinary advances in outdoor localisation and navigation, indoor localisation still remains an open challenge. Fundamental to any location system are the algorithms used to estimate location. This thesis focuses on formulation of localisation algorithms with the capability of fusing measurements from multiple modalities. We begin by systematically analysing the basic principles of localisation through a review and classification {{of the state of the}} art. From our detailed survey, it is evident that no location system is error-free and suited for all situations. For example, pure inertial sensors suffer from drift, ultrasound sensors require clear line of sight and magnetic sensors are affected by ferromagnetic and conductive materials in the environment. Thus, we rationalise "multimodal localisation" as one of the promising ways for improving location accuracy. Apart from improving performance of the location system in limited measurement volumes, fusion of heterogeneous sensing systems will ultimately allow people to move between places covered by different sensing systems without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> knowledge. We explore localisation algorithms that use multiple sensing modalities to improve accuracy and robustness. To ground our work, we have chosen three specific applications covering both infrastructure-based positioning and ad hoc-based positioning systems. From our taxonomy, we create a blueprint of location technologies that would meet those three application needs. -Localisation in office environments to facilitate social networking, as a way to help coordination of people and understand social patterns. We leverage the existing wireless local-area networks (WLAN) infrastructure to sense motion and location with the main motivation of building wide-area location services. Our contributions include [...] (i) in-depth characterisation of received signal strength (RSSI), (ii) novel algorithms to deduce motion by observing fluctuations in RSSI across all the access points in range, and (iii) performance comparison using real data against common deterministic location algorithms with and without adding motion information. -Transport and logistics operation (e. g. in warehouses), motivating the need of fine-grained location information. We use ultra-wideband (UWB) as it copes with harsh indoor environments better than conventional radio technologies. Our contributions include [...] (i) characterisation of heterogeneous observations (pseudoranges and angles) obtained from two deployments, mimicking real-world (low-overhead) vs. ideal deployment (carefully planned and calibrated), (ii) formulation of algorithms to fuse heterogeneous observations and (iii) a thorough evaluation for both static and dynamic tracking. -Emergency response scenarios, motivating the need for ad hoc positioning capabilities. In particular, we use a combination of inertial sensors and ultrasound sensors. The position error in a purely inertial system increases with time and requires correction from external sources. We address this problem by deploying ultrasound sensors as landmarks correcting for the inertial drift. Our contributions include [...] (i) characterisation of inertial and ultrasound data, (ii) algorithms to support guidance and tracking and (iii) a thorough evaluation from data gathered from real deployments. While the chosen technologies and applications are not exhaustive, they are representative as they cover a broad spectrum across several dimensions: accuracy [...] fine grained to coarse grained, coverage [...] room-level to wide-area, dependence [...] dense infrastructure to ad hoc, cost [...] expensive to minimal cost. In every instance, we have illustrated the benefits of combining multiple modalities. In short, our contributions include algorithms for motion detection and technology independent localisation algorithms that have the ability to fuse readings across different sensing technologies and incorporate motion models to improve accuracy significantly. Another important aspect of the work presented in this thesis is the characterisation of the raw measurement errors of the individual modalities. In all cases, we perform a rigorous evaluation of the presented algorithms by using measurements collected from real deployments. ...|$|E

Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive case series study included all spinal tuberculosis cases who have been diagnosed in Yazd city between 2001 and 2008. A questionnaire was applied to collect the data about demographic, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, medical or surgical therapeutic approaches, complications and outcome of treatment were collected by questionnaire. Analysis was done by SPSS(version 10. 5) and p value< 0. 05 was taken as significant. Results: Fifty patients were evaluated in this study, the most frequent age group of patients the 40 - 60 year group, and the least frequent was the group< 20 years old.

The overall objective of this thesis {{was to assess the}} GHG emissions derived from supply and energy-utilization chains of forest biomass in Finland, with a specific focus on the effect <b>of</b> <b>location</b> in relation to forest biomass’s availability and the transportation possibilities. Biomass availability and transportation-network assessments were conducted through utilization of geographical information system methods, and the GHG emissions were assessed by means of lifecycle assessment. The thesis is based on four papers in which forest biomass supply on industrial scale was assessed. The feedstocks assessed in this thesis include harvesting residues, smalldiameter energy wood and stumps. The principal implication of the findings in this thesis is that in Finland, the <b>location</b> and availability <b>of</b> biomass in the proximity of a given energyutilization or energy-conversion plant is not a decisive factor in supply-chain GHG emissions or the possible GHG savings to be achieved with forest-biomass energy use.

Both fix acquisition rates and proportions of 3 D fixes in free-ranging ibexes were lowest (close to 85 %) in winter and highest (close to 95 %) in summer, and exhibited contrasting seasonal diel patterns, being lowest during the night and highest at midday in winter, and lowest at midday and highest at dawn and dusk in summer. Fix acquisition rates and proportions of 3 D fixes were positively influenced by individual activity, warm temperatures in winter, absence of precipitation in all seasons, and shallow snow depth in winter. These effects could explain the seasonal and diel patterns. The performance of GPS telemetry of large herbivores at Alpine habitats can be as good as or better than in forested habitats at low elevations.

40|$|The {{advent of}} big data has aided {{understanding}} of the driving forces of human mobility, which is beneficial for many fields, such as mobility prediction, urban planning, and traffic management. However, the data sources used in many studies, such as mobile phone location and geo-tagged social media data, are sparsely sampled in the temporal scale. An individual’s records can be distributed over {{a few hours a}} day, or a week, or over just a few hours a month. Thus, the representativeness of sparse mobile phone location data in characterizing human mobility requires analysis before using data to derive human mobility patterns. This paper investigates this important issue through an approach that uses subscriber mobile phone location data collected by a major carrier in Shenzhen, China. A dataset of over 5 million mobile phone subscribers that covers 24 h a day is used as a benchmark to test the representativeness <b>of</b> mobile phone <b>location</b> data on human mobility indicators, such as total travel distance, movement entropy, and radius of gyration. This study divides this dataset by hour, using 2 - to 23 -h segments to evaluate the representativeness due to the availability <b>of</b> mobile phone <b>location</b> data. The results show that different numbers of hourly segments affect estimations of human mobility indicators and can cause overestimations or underestimations from the individual perspective. On average, the total travel distance and movement entropy tend to be underestimated. The underestimation coefficient results for estimation of total travel distance are approximately linear, declining as the number of time segments increases, and the underestimation coefficient results for estimating movement entropy decline logarithmically as the time segments increase, whereas the radius of gyration tends to be more ambiguous due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> isolated <b>locations.</b> This paper suggests that researchers should carefully interpret results derived from this type of sparse data in the era of big data...|$|R

We analyze experimental parameters and conditions necessary for interference to be observed. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, RevTeX, submitted to PR...|$|R
5000|$|Fulminante {{accompanied}} Lord Keith’s {{invasion of}} Egypt. Here she supported General Sir Ralph Abercromby {{as he moved}} his troops from Abukir to Alexandria. She was stationed close to the shore to fire on French shore positions but her carronades {{did not have the}} range and so her shots fell short.On 23 March Corbet therefore brought her to within a cable’s length (240 yards) of the shore and anchored her there. During the night the wind rose, causing one of her cables to rub against the rocks, parting it. The second cable did not hold and within minutes Fulmiante had drifted on shore and was wrecked. There was no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> life. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the wreck was reportedly [...] "La Cruelle", near Damietta, which is to the east of Abu Qir. The court martial for the loss occurred on 1 April and apparently absolved Corbet. On 15 May Corbet delivered dispatches from Keith to the Admiralty.Although Fulminante was present for less than a month during the campaign, when the Admiralty in 1847 authorized the awarding of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Egypt" [...] to all surviving claimants from the crews of all vessels present between 8 March and 2 September, Fulminante was among the vessels listed as qualifying.|$|R
40|$|Location-dependent {{data are}} central to many {{emerging}} applications, ranging from traffic information services to sensor networks. The standard pull- and push-based data dissemination models become unworkable since the data volumes and number of clients are high. We address this problem using locale covers, {{a subset of the}} original set <b>of</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> interest, chosen to include at least one location in a suitably defined neighborhood of any client. Since location-dependent values are highly correlated with location, a query can be answered using a location close to the query point. We show that location-dependent queries may be answered sat-isfactorily using locale covers, with small <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> accuracy. Our approach is independent <b>of</b> <b>locations</b> and speeds <b>of</b> clients, and is applicable to mobile clients. 1...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} noted, however, that the declining {{geographical}} range that baiji have been spotted in is {{not connected to}} the population <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> baiji. A model provided by Yangtze fishing communities show that the baiji population was not connected by geographical range or fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>location,</b> as the baiji make long-term and periodic movements throughout several years. The movements of the baiji left the species unaffected by dwindling geographical range.|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of service}} (QoS) {{provisioning}} {{is an important}} issue in wireless networks. The less interruption time or packet <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a communication session is, the better quality of service is. In this paper, we propose a new link switching scheme for LED-ID networks based on the history <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> mobile devices (as known as readers). Our proposed scheme is based on the standpoint that in indoor environments people tendentiously move in restricted trajectories. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional scheme...|$|R
