Though some authors have suggested that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between polities and civil war, the role of state and its capacity has not been effectively studied.

40|$|This thesis will {{inquire into}} the {{practicable}} strategies that Thomas Hobbes described in his major works of political philosophy, {{on the one}} hand, to allow his sovereign to ensure <b>civil</b> <b>peace,</b> and on the other, to enable his sovereign to defend the commonwealth. In terms of <b>civil</b> <b>peace,</b> the exercise of Hobbes’s sovereign’s ‘absolute’ authority is tempered by, and contingent on, its practical efficacy for securing and maintaining a peaceful commonwealth. To that end, I will argue that Hobbes’s sovereign is obliged to rule according to the natural laws, and entailed in this obligation are coinciding liberties which Hobbes believed that subjects must perceive themselves to possess, and which sovereigns must respect, in order for peace to be realised. However, rather than situating the purpose of Hobbes’s project in terms of <b>civil</b> <b>peace</b> alone—as {{the vast majority of}} his interpreters have—I consider alongside the purpose of <b>civil</b> <b>peace,</b> and contrast it with, the purpose of defence. Evident from this comparison is that the means by which Hobbes’s sovereign must ensure the capability of the commonwealth to defend itself from foreign nations simultaneously undermines and counteracts his otherwise proto-liberal system. Distinct from other prominent interpretations, I will argue that this ambivalence is not a result of an imbalance between subjects’ rights contra sovereign’s rights, nor yet of an unsupervised agonistic counter-balance between the two. Instead, the affirmation of subjects’ inalienable rights are depicted by Hobbes as a practically ineffective means by which to ensure defence. There exists a necessary ambivalence within Hobbes’s theory of sovereignty itself and is to be managed solely according to the sovereign’s ideally prudent and practicable judgment. Ultimately, I will characterize Hobbes as arguing that the unfortunate necessity of preparedness for foreign defensive wars is best mitigated by the sovereign’s prudent and minimal exercise of the commonwealth’s power in carrying out this intended purpose...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, several corrupt, authoritarian, and autocratic regimes have fallen. New states and democracies have emerged {{by a variety}} of means. How a {{transition}} occurs have significant impact on {{the success or failure of}} democratic reform. But the notion that democratization processes are potentially dangerous and may lead to conflict has made scholars warn policy makers about optimism as regard to democracy promotion. This thesis examines the relationship between regime change and violent and nonviolent campaigns. The direction of the causality between the two is still an open issue in the democratic <b>civil</b> <b>peace</b> literature. The inclusion of lagged regime change variables, and nonviolent campaigns are novel contributions to the field of the democratization-conflict linkage. The empirical evidence of this thesis suggests that there is a relationship, but that it is more often conflicts that cause regime change, rather than regime change being a trigger for conflicts. Further, it seems that nonviolent campaigns is better at achieving its goals and ensure democracy and <b>civil</b> <b>peace...</b>|$|R
