25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are extrapyramidal motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a <b>lateral</b> <b>system.</b> The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> which provides fine control of movement.|$|E

Three forms of <b>lateral</b> <b>systems</b> i. e. moment frames, steel cross bracings and concrete shear walls are utilized at varying elevations of the building to determine an optimal set of results. Besides analyzing structural optimality, the MATLAB algorithm developed {{as a part of}} this research paper also evaluates each system for its overall structural weight, material cost and embodied carbon. By taking a multi-objective optimization approach at the design of <b>lateral</b> load-resisting <b>systems</b> in buildings, this research devises a practical tool that can be used by designers to assess and examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various layouts of <b>lateral</b> <b>systems.</b> The algorithm also enables the user to specify the location and type of certain lateral elements, which may correspond to practical architectural constraints, and juxtapose results from user-defined layouts with the optimized solution. by Nablul Haseeb.

40|$|In teleost fishes, the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> {{is assumed}} to contribute, among other roles, to {{maintaining}} schooling behaviour. Sight is also assumed {{to play a role}} in schooling, as fish with a cut lateral line do not stop schooling unless they are also blinded. This conclusion, however, is based on experiments where only the trunk lateral line was inactivated, leaving the head <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> intact. We investigated how inactivation of the whole <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> affects fish shoaling behaviour. Groups of firehead tetras, Hemigrammus bleheri, were videorecorded before and after inactivation of their whole <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> with aminoglycoside antibiotics (and also in sham-treated specimens). Shoaling behaviour was characterized by nearest distance to the first, second and third neighbours, shoal radius, shoal order parameter and the number of collisions between individuals. Scanning electron microscope observations showed damage to most superficial neuromasts as a result of antibiotic treatment. Importantly, the antibiotic-treated fish proved unable to maintain a shoal. After the end of the treatment, however, they recovered both a normal tissue morphology and normal shoaling behaviour within about a month. The <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> is thus more crucial to shoaling behaviour than previously believed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect and consequence of <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> inactivation on fish nocturnal feeding, the differential growth of groups of European sea bass maintained in different rearing conditions were compared. Whereas some fish with intact <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> (placebo fish) were placed under a photoperiod of 12 -L: 12 -D, other placebo fish were kept in the dark. In the same way, fish deprived of <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> by section of their <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> nerves and antibiotic treatment were placed under a photoperiod of 12 -L : 12 -D and {{the others in the}} dark. For each of these four rearing conditions, two sets of experiment were realized. Percent mortality, feed rhythm, averaged daily feed demand, specific growth rate and feed efficiency were compared among these four groups of fish. After four months of experiment, results revealed that, under a photoperiod of 12 -L: 12 -D, fish showed a diurnal feed rhythm whereas no rhythm appeared in fish kept in the dark. In addition, as reported by other authors, the average daily feed demand, the quantity of ingested food and specific growth rate were greater in fish maintained under a photoperiod of 12 -L : 12 -D than those kept in the dark. The fish <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> inactivation did not affect mortality, feed intake, specific growth rate or feed efficiency. These results demonstrated that <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> is not the major sensory organ leading to European sea bass nocturnal feeding; chemoreception system undoubtedly taking over. If the olfactory system explains equal feed intake between placebo and treated fish, the greater specific growth rate in treated than in placebo fish indicates the action of another mechanism, such as a "booster effect" of antibiotics used for <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> inactivation on fish.

40|$|In this paper, the {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic model}} of the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed. Different from the traditional steering system, a driver’s reaction model is introduced and meanwhile the disturbance caused by irregularities of road surface is also considered in this paper. Based on the integrated nonlinear dynamic equations, {{it shows that the}} stability of <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> of EVs is closely related to the heading speed of the vehicle. The <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> has a Hopf bifurcation when the vehicle heading speed equals a critical value, and then enters into chaos domain along with the increment of the vehicle heading speed. The unstable behaviors may make EVs spin and even turn over, which are quite harmful to the safety of EVs. As for this issue, a control method is proposed and implemented to protect the vehicle from spinning and thus improve the safety of EVs. The computer simulation is utilized in this paper to analyze nonlinear dynamics, as well as to validate the existence of chaotic motions and the feasibility of the control scheme. From the simulation results, it shows that the chaotic motions existing in the EV lateral dynamics can be suppressed by the proposed control method, and thus the corresponding cornering performance and safety are improved. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the seismic {{behaviors}} of interior post-tensioned (PT) and reinforced concrete (RC) flat plate slab-column connections designed to resist only gravity loads. In general, flat plate systems have been used to support gravity loads, which should be constructed with <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> such as shear walls or moment frames. Flat plate systems should retain the ability to undergo the lateral drift associated with the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> without loss of gravity load carrying capacity. Although these systems are common, relatively little experimental study has been conducted to assess actual behavior under lateral loads. Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess the seismic performance of two PT and one RC slab-column interior connection under high gravity loads. This study observed that PT connections had a better seismic performance than corresponding RC connections in terms strength, deformability, energy absorption...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic {{exposure}} to a low concentration (0. 5 microg l(- 1)) of cadmium ions was investigated on escape behaviour of sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, using video analysis. Observations were also performed on the microanatomy of <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> neuromasts. When fish were exposed for 4 h per day over 8 days to the cadmium ions, most of both types of neuromasts observed remained intact. However, some of them presented damaged sensory maculae. Whereas before cadmium exposure, fish responded positively to nearly all the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> stimulations, after exposure they decreased by about 10 % their positive responses to stimulations.

40|$|Micro-compression {{testing is}} a {{promising}} technique for determining mechanical properties at small length scales {{since it has}} several benefits over nanoindentation. However, as for all newtechniques, experimental constraints influencing the results of such a micro-mechanical test must be considered.

Using a focused ion beam milling setup, single crystal Cu specimens with different geometries and crystal orientationswere fabricated. Tapered samples served to investigate the influence of strain gradients, while stiff sample top coatings and undeformable substrates depict the influence of dislocation pile-ups at these interfaces. The <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> stiffness was reduced by placing specimens on top of needles.

40|$|Stuttering {{is one of}} {{the most}} common speech disorders. However, the {{etiology}} is poorly understood, and is likely to be heterogeneous. The aim of this thesis was to clarify causal mechanisms, focusing the brain. The project included theoretical development based on published data, and a broad approach of explorative studies and testing of hypotheses. The theoretical work focused the basal ganglia, leading to a model based on the dual premotor systems hypothesis (G. Goldberg, 1985, 1991), which defines two parallel premotor systems: the medial (the basal ganglia and the SMA), and the lateral (the lateral premotor cortex and the cerebellum). Stuttering is suggested to be caused by a disturbance of the medial system, in most cases in the basal ganglia. The core dysfunction is proposed to be impaired "go-signals" from the medial system, supposed to trigger the next motor segment in speech. According to this model, under some conditions speech control is shifted from the medial to the <b>lateral</b> <b>system,</b> thereby bypassing the dysfunction and resulting in fluent speech. The <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> is suggested to be active when speech is combined with sensory input, like chorus speech or metronome. Also the effect of altered auditory feedback in reducing stuttering is proposed to be based on this mechanism. It seems as the <b>lateral</b> <b>system</b> is able control speech timing without sensory input, but that this demands increased attention to some particular aspect of speech, as occurs in imitation of dialects, exaggerated rhythm, reduced speech rate, or role play. Also singing is suggested to be based on the <b>lateral</b> <b>system.</b> Superfluous muscular activation accompanying stuttering may be a type of dystonia: involuntary contractions related to the basal ganglia disturbance. The high prevalence of stuttering at age 2. 5 to 3 years is proposed to reflect a normally occurring peak in the number of dopamine receptors at this age. A total of 35 stuttering adults participated. Two studies, of copper metabolism and "startle prepulse inhibition", did not indicate any significant differences in comparison with matched controls. It has previously been reported that stuttering may be associated with increased neuromuscular reactivity, measured as exaggerated eye-blink in response to noise. This aspect was investigated. The stuttering group showed somewhat stronger eye-blink, though not statistically significant. Strong eye-blink was not related to anxiety, but was clearly related to low calcium, which is known to increase the excitability of the nervous system. The stuttering group showed somewhat lower calcium, and a weak tendency towards more severe stuttering in case of low calcium. It is possible that low calcium can increase the severity of stuttering in some cases. A subgroup reported some traits of childhood ADHD, and this group typically also reported neurological incidents before the onset of stuttering. The subgroup without traits of ADHD typically reported having stuttering relatives but no neurological incident...|$|E
