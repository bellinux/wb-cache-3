5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} that, in early May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> picture.|$|E

With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she left <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied {{defeat of}} Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,000people {{evacuated}} {{to emergency}} shelters on Grenada, including hundreds in low-lying {{areas in the}} capital city. Some shelters were damaged during the hurricane, forcing the evacuees to go elsewhere.

More than 1,000residents of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines evacuated to 28emergency shelters. On Barbados, officials closed schools and government buildings and prepared shelters prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. To minimize danger, the island power grid was shut down. Four shelters opened on Saint Lucia, where many people sought safety during the storm.|$|E

After {{playing in the}} first two matches against Western Australia, scoring only 3 not out and 1 as New South Wales took both matches, she was absent until the finals series. Victoria had qualified first and hosted the three-match series. Poulton was omitted for the first match, which was won by the home team, before being recalled for the second match. She made 1 and 11 as New South Wales won the last two fixtures by five and three wickets respectively to claim the title. However, Poulton contributed <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team's triumph, managing only 16 runs at 5.33. At {{the end of the season}} she was appointed captain of the Australian Youth team and played in four matches against New Zealand A, scoring 127 runs at 31.75 with a best of 75 in the second of these fixtures. Sarah Tsukigawa had success against Poulton, dismissing her three times in a row. Australia won all but the last match.|$|E

5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was {{isolated}} in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> death cap's toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) Blusher (Amanita rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.|$|E

There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland.

Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, relative to its position on the ridge.

5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally agreeing with the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues. From the 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship, and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E

5|$|To the north, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade {{suffered}} {{the attention of}} German artillery even before beginning to move forward at 1:00 am. The attack did not begin until 6:30 am, when three battalions of riflemen began advancing. There had been no time to arrange a covering barrage {{and there was no}} armoured support. Despite heavy machine gun fire, all three battalions made their initial objectives but made little progress beyond these due to the strongly defended villages of St. Aubin and Beugnâtre, both to the northeast of Bapaume. Beugnâtre had been thought to have been captured by the 5th Division and thus the German presence in the village was unexpected. By 10:00 am, the attack had petered out and the battalions were consolidating their positions, during which they had to fend off a counterattack from Beugnâtre. On short notice, a further attack was arranged for the evening with the aim of pushing forward to the road to Cambrai, this time with a supporting artillery barrage. The 3rd Rifle Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, in a salient between Bapaume and St. Aubin, was to test the defences of the town with fighting patrols. The 2nd Rifle Battalion was to flank St. Aubin and advance for the Cambrai Road alongside 4th Rifle Battalion, which would also link up with 5th Division, which had the task of taking Beugnâtre. However, instructions to the attacking battalions were issued late and several companies did not receive their orders until the barrage had already commenced. Brigadier General Herbert Hart, commanding the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, realising the inadequacy of the preparation time, tried to cancel the operation but to no avail. Despite this, Beugnâtre did fall to the British; advancing under a covering barrage, the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) penetrated the village relatively easily before encountering strong machine gun. Even so, the KOSB pushed the Germans out and this secured the outer flank of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. However, while the New Zealanders did reach the Cambrai road, they were unable to hold it and had to settle for securing the railway line to Cambrai instead, this line being a <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of the road. St. Aubin was also captured by the 2nd Rifle Battalion.|$|E
