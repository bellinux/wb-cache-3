The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A lock washer is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R
50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated <b>lock</b> <b>washer)</b> that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{provides}} a comprehensive, high-resolution structural {{analysis of the}} central-pair microtubule apparatus of sperm flagella. It describes the arrangement of several microtubule-associated "sheath " components and suggests, contrary to previous thinking, that microtubules are structurally asymmetric. The two microtubules of the central pair are different in several respects: the C tubule bears a single row of 18 -nm-long sheath projections with an axial periodicity of 16 nm, whereas the C, tubule possesses rows of 9 -nm globular sheath components with an axial repeat of 32 nm. The lumen of the C tubule always appears completely filled with electron-dense material; that of the C, tubule is frequently hollow. The C tubule also possesses a series of beaded chains arranged around the microtubule; the beaded chains are composed of globular subunits 7. 5 - 10 nm in diameter and appear to function in the pairing of the C, and C tubules. These findings indicate: that the beaded chains are not helical, but assume the form of <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> arranged with a 16 -nm axial periodicity on the microtubule; and that the lattice of tubulin dimers in the C tubule is not helically symmetric, but that there are seams between certain pairs of protofilaments.

40|$|Baffle Former Bolts {{are vital}} joint {{elements}} of the reactor core internal structure. Since 1989, successive UT inspections in various European plants have revealed a trend of progressive indications. Different bolt and locking designs have been used during the initial design and building phase of the plants. Lock-bar style bolts are one type of bolts which are used in numerous plants in Europe and the US. Lock-bar style bolts pose a challenge due to limited ultrasonic probe access availability. Furthermore, the inspection approach has to capture indications in the bolt threaded region {{as well as in}} the bolt head to shank interface. During recently performed qualifications in Europe the ultrasonic inspection of lock-bar style bolts has been improved by using advanced probe design and an an alysis approach. Based on blind test qualification testing performed on sample bolts a high degree of confidence could be achieved. Inner hexagon (hex) bolts with a <b>locking</b> <b>washer</b> represent another design used in several plants in Europe and the US. This bolt design poses another challenge based on varying cone dimensions and limited access through the inner hex. Ultrasonic beam field simulations have been performed to support and verify laboratory and qualification testing. This paper describes the qualification process in more detail.

40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, retaining <b>washers,</b> <b>locking</b> <b>washers,</b> serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R
