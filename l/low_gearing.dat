25|$|French Presidents from Georges Pompidou to Jacques Chirac {{have enjoyed}} touring Paris {{in the two}} 4-door {{convertible}} Citroën SM présidentielle models, sharing them with such notables as Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II. These manual transmission cars have special <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> suitable for parade use.|$|E
2500|$|The S50 {{was sold}} in some markets with an A150 designation. In European markets (and other export markets), it was also marketed as the PMC-Mikado A150. The S50-2 was also sold as the S56SE A190D, which was {{equipped}} with the [...] 1.9 liter D-6 OHV diesel engine. This model had trim and equipment levels similar to the S50S-2. In Europe, period testers commented on the car's compact size (more like a 1.0 than a 1.5) and its sprightly performance, in large {{part due to the}} extremely <b>low</b> <b>gearing.</b> The car's ample lighting was also noted, offering twin headlights, a bevy of warning lamps, numerous engine room light fittings, etcetera. Also lauded were the cars road manners, as evident by the six-cylinder Skyline's competition successes.|$|E
50|$|Gear inches is one {{of several}} {{relative}} measures of bicycle gearing, giving an indication of the mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very <b>low</b> <b>gearing)</b> via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> is for going up hills and high gearing is for going fast.|$|E
50|$|It was {{programmed}} {{to start in}} <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> providing a gear ratio of 1.765:1 plus the additional low-speed multiplication of the torque converter. The shift pattern was Park-Reverse-Neutral-Drive-Low. In Drive at full throttle, it would upshift from <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> to high gear at 60 - 65 mph.|$|R

50|$|Unlike class 306, {{the eight}} class 506s {{remained}} solely equipped for 1,500V DC operation for their entire lives. This made them unable {{to operate on}} any lines other than the Woodhead route — although they rarely operated east of Hadfield due to <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> {{and the risk of}} overheating.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a {{tractive effort}} of 14,300 lb in <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> which enabled it to move loads {{of up to}} 1000 tons in <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> at walking speed. In a higher gear, the locomotives could haul a lighter load at speeds of up to 30 mph, a respectable figure for a locomotive that had relatively small (39¾") driving wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Ratio 19:19, <b>Low</b> <b>gear</b> 12600 lbf kN, High gear 4705 lbf kN (68154-68179 and 68184-68185) ...|$|R
50|$|A two plate dry disk {{diaphragm}} spring clutch drove Fuller four-speed main and three-speed auxiliary transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive <b>gears.</b> The <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> allowed several very <b>low</b> <b>gears</b> for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R
50|$|The rear-engined Bongos {{had a full}} chassis (using {{the same}} Mazda 1000 engine as other {{variants}} mounted to a four-speed transaxle at the rear) and were very strong and due to the <b>low</b> <b>gearing,</b> able to carry half a ton. Due to rust and poor maintenance, these Bongos are now rare. The 1000 pickup and Bongo chassis are different, with common front suspension and brake components.|$|E
5000|$|Authors such as Simon Doughty {{describe}} a 'typical' randonneuring bike as being {{somewhere between a}} dedicated road-racing bike and a touring bike. [...] Such bicycles usually have lightweight steel frames, drop handlebars, relaxed (i.e. comfortable) frame geometry, medium-width tyres, triple chainsets, moderately <b>low</b> <b>gearing,</b> {{and the capacity to}} carry lightweight luggage. Mudguards and lighting systems are also common, and may be required for some events.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968 the C2SS {{was renamed}} the C2TR {{apparently}} indicating an off-road capability. It {{had a new}} style fuel tank design without rubber knee grips, a contrasting [...] "Kawasaki" [...] decal covering the entire side of the tank, a raised front fender, a rear rack for small amounts of cargo, and 4-speed transmission with high and <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> via 2 rear sprockets changed manually.|$|E

50|$|The IGR, hub {{revolutions}} per sprocket {{revolution of}} the Speedhub, lies between 0.279 and 1.467 depending on the gear chosen. The Speedhub has a 526&thinsp;% range between the highest and <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> Gear 11, with a ratio of 1.0, is called the neutral gear.|$|R
25|$|This {{term has}} no {{generally}} accepted meaning. Originally it {{referred to a}} gearing arrangement which had one especially <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> (for climbing Alpine passes); this <b>low</b> <b>gear</b> often had a larger than average jump to the next <b>lowest</b> <b>gear.</b> In the 1960s the term was used by salespeople to refer to then current 10-speed bicycles (2 chainrings, 5-sprocket cogset), without any regard to its original meaning. The nearest current equivalent to the original meaning {{can be found in}} the Shimano Megarange cogsets, where most of the sprockets have roughly a 15% relative difference, except for the largest sprocket which has roughly a 30% difference; this provides a much lower gear than normal at the cost of a large gearing jump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Mack EY, 6-cylinder {{gasoline}} with a displacement of 707 cuin L generating [...] at 2100 rpm and [...] at 800 rpm. The transmission had 5 gears forward and one reverse. The {{installation of a}} transfer case with an additional reduction gear allowed high and <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> (5F1Rx2).Traction was in all six wheels (6x6), with 14.00-24 tires. The empty weight of the vehicle was 29,103 lb when empty, and 44,453 lb fully loaded.|$|E
50|$|The Lola {{proposal}} was chosen, since Lola {{had used a}} Ford V8 engine in their mid-engined Lola Mk6 (also known as Lola GT). It {{was one of the}} most advanced racing cars of the time, and made a noted performance in Le Mans 1963, even though the car did not finish, due to <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> and slow revving out on the Mulsanne Straight. However, Eric Broadley, Lola Cars' owner and chief designer, agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without involving Lola Cars.|$|E
5000|$|The RK101 {{used the}} 1994 cc 5R engine. Its [...] in Japanese trim, {{combined}} with <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> for higher load capacity, provided {{a top speed}} of only 110 km/h. In later versions higher compression meant that power increased to [...] at 5200 rpm. The engine displacement remained under 2.0 litres so as to offer Japanese buyers some tax advantages {{when it came time to}} pay the Japanese annual road tax. The South African RK101 claimed [...] SAE at 5200 rpm. Export models to DIN specifications claimed [...]|$|E

5000|$|In <b>low</b> <b>gear,</b> the {{sprocket}} {{drives the}} annulus (in red above) {{and the planet}} carrier (in green above) drives the hub, giving a gear reduction.|$|R
50|$|Most {{off-road}} vehicles are fitted with especially <b>low</b> <b>gearing.</b> This allows the operator {{to make the}} most of the engine's available power while moving slowly through challenging terrain. An internal combustion engine coupled to a normal gearbox often has an output speed too high. The vehicle often has one of two things, either a very low ("granny") first gear (like the all wheel drive Volkswagen Transporter versions) or an additional gearbox in line with the first, called a reduction drive. Some vehicles, like the Bv206 in the picture on the right, also have torque converters to further reduce the gearing.|$|E
50|$|Trials riding is {{an extreme}} test of bicycle {{handling}} skills, over all kinds of obstacles, both natural and man-made. It now has a strong - though small - following worldwide, though it is still primarily a European sport. Skills taken from trials riding can be used practically on any bicycle for balance, for example controlled braking and track standing, or balancing on the bike without putting a foot down. Competition trial bikes are characterized by powerful brakes, wide handlebars, lightweight parts, single-speed <b>low</b> <b>gearing,</b> low tire pressures with a thick rear tire, distinctive frame geometry, and usually no seat.|$|E
50|$|The climb from Malaucène is {{in theory}} {{at least as}} {{difficult}} as the Bédoin route with some very steep sections up to 12%+, but these sections are followed by much easier parts of 2-5% which allow a touring cyclist to rest in a way a racing cyclist would not but very <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> is essential. In addition the road is wide {{for most of the}} climb, well surfaced and with a marked cycling lane at the side and therefore much safer than the Bédoin climb. Lastly for cyclecampers there is a small campsite at around 1400m which can be used to break the climb.|$|E

5000|$|In Europe, {{the term}} SUV {{has a similar}} meaning, but being newer than in the U.S. it only applies to the newer street {{oriented}} one, where-as [...] "Jeep", [...] "Land Rover" [...] or 4x4 are used for the off-roader oriented ones. Not all SUVs have four-wheel drive capabilities, and not all four-wheel-drive passenger vehicles are SUVs. Although some SUVs have off-road capabilities, they often play only a secondary role, and SUVs often {{do not have the}} ability to switch among two-wheel and four-wheel-drive high gearing and four-wheel-drive <b>low</b> <b>gearing.</b> While automakers tout an SUV's off-road prowess with advertising and naming, the daily use of SUVs is largely on paved roads.|$|E
5000|$|The Typo You 1942 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} ER, built to the very strict requirements of the regime of Benito Mussolini [...] It received forced air cooling with a fan, but without the usual wind tunnel around the cylinder. In addition, {{there was also a}} reduction in the final drive, allowing a high and <b>low</b> <b>gearing</b> arose. In combination with the three-speed gearbox were the two shipments in the final reduction 3 x 2 = 6 forward gears and 1 x 2 = 2 reverse gears on. The fork was reinforced and the chassis too. Therefore, the payload was increased to more than 1,000 kg.|$|E
