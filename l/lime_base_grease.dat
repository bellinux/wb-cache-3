The formulated greases (GXL- 296 B and GXL- 320 B) contained a proprietary antiwear additive at an optimized concentration. Tests were conducted using a vacuum four-ball tribometer. AISI 52100 steel specimens were used for all GXL- 296 tests. Both AISI 52100 steel and 440 C stainless steel were tested with the GXL- 320 greases. Test conditions included: a pressure less than 6. 7 x 10 (exp) - 4 Pa, a 200 N load, a sliding velocity of 28. 8 mm/sec (100 rpm) and room temperature (approximately equal to 23 C). Wear rates for each grease were determined from {{the slope of the}} wear volume as a function of sliding distance. Both non-additive <b>base</b> <b>greases</b> yielded relatively high wear rates on the order of 10 (exp - 8) cu mm using AISI 52100 steel specimens. Formulated grease GXL- 296 B yielded a reduction in wear rate by a factor of approximately 21, while grease GXL- 320 B had a reduction of approximately 12 times. Lower wear rates (- 50 %) were observed with both GXL- 320 greases using 440 C stainless steel.

With the aim to minimize incompatibility problems between the original materials and the grouts, several natural hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>based</b> grouts, {{as well as a}} ternary (lime-pozzolan-cement) grout with reduced cement content, have been studied. The selection of the most suitable grouts was performed based on a set of criteria, namely injectability, mechanical and durability characteristics. The selected grouts were subsequently injected into cylindrical specimens that simulate the infill of three-leaf stone masonry. The experimental results obtained from mechanical tests carried out on the injected cylinders demonstrated that all grout mixes studied within this work were efficient in strengthening the infill material; they exhibited, however, differences in terms of durability properties.

40|$|<b>Lime</b> <b>based</b> mortars dated back to 4 th- 3 rd century BC were sampled in a Punic-Roman {{residential}} area recently {{brought to light}} in the historical centre of Palermo. The collected mortars have been analyzed by optical microscopy (PLM), X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS). The study was aimed to characterize these materials from the textural and compositional {{point of view in}} order to define the recipes. The mineralogical and petrographic investigations allowed to establish 4 different recipes used for the formulation of the studied floor and wall mortars in terms of both compositional and textural features. The aggregate resulted to be composed by different proportions of alluvial calcareous and siliceous sand or else by “cocciopesto”. Aerial <b>lime</b> <b>based</b> mortars (for the most part magnesium-bearing) have been used for wall coatings and decorations, while the use of hydraulic <b>lime</b> <b>based</b> mortars was mainly documented for floor covering. Furthermore, it is interesting to report an unusual mosaic floor covering manufactured with “tesserae” obtained from over fired limestone scraps (locally produced) and aerial lime-based binder. These results contribute to improve the knowledge concerning raw materials and recipes (relative to the end-use) employed for mortar manufacturing at Palermo in antiquity. A diachronic correlation with previously studied mortars manufactured in Baroque and Neoclassic periods was also made.

40|$|<b>Lime</b> <b>based</b> mortars have {{different}} {{applications in the}} field of restoration of monuments, e. g. bedding, jointing, plastering, mending or filling the gaps and even desalination. Water soluble salts are quite often present in historical constructions and are considered {{to be one of the}} main damaging and powerful reasons for deterioration of porous masonry. According to the previous research devoted to restoration mixtures as well as analysis of historical binders, compositions keeping the ratio binder (calcium or dolomitic lime) to filler (sand) 1 : 3 were elaborated. Different additives as portlandcement, natural pozzolana or trass in amount of 12 % for experimental model samples were used. The investigation included visual observation, microscopical evaluation of state of samples, mercury porosity measurements before and after exposure in salts solutions, profiles of distribution of nitrate, sulphate and chlorine ions and crystalline phases in all depths samples by chemical and XRD analysis as well as measurements of compressive strength, density. Laboratory scale studies indicated that both the dynamics and rate of water absorbtion, ability to draw in solution of salts, resistence to salt crystallisation and compressive strength is in strong correlation with the porosity, density of samples as well as type of binder and additives. Obtained experimental data can further serve as a data base for planning practical restoration activities in salinated environments and where application of <b>lime</b> <b>based</b> grouts is essential.

This coincided with the vacating of the property by the King Edward VII Convalescent Home for Naval and Military Officers in 2000. The research was primarily focused on the exterior of the property and on selected buildings and structures sited within the surrounding parkland. Over successive redecorations the intended colour palette for the house and associated buildings and also for the estate had been lost and was based upon ubiquitous mid green and modern white. In addition the house itself was designed by Cubbitt being constructed of iron beams with rendered facades and cement based balustrades and embellishments to imitate finely jointed ashlar work and carved detailing. The effects of the weather and the proximity of the house to the coast had caused extensive discolouration, crazing and unsympathetic patch repairs. The research was focused at identifying the original decorative finishes and schemes based again on extensive research within the Royal Archives at Windsor supported by on-site investigations and a phased program of cross-sectional paint investigations.
