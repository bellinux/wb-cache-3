Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British <b>Landrace,</b> and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including the Large Black. By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E

A {{total of}} 415 sorghum <b>landraces</b> were sampled to {{represent}} the range of agro-ecologies (three altitude ranges) as well as spatial heterogeneity, that is, 4 zones: North Welo, South Welo, Oromiya and North Shewa with each zone containing 2 to 5 districts. The <b>landraces</b> were genotyped with simple sequence repeats (SSR) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. High genetic diversity was observed among the <b>landraces</b> for both marker systems. STRUCTURE analysis revealed 4 clusters of genetically differentiated groups of <b>landraces.</b> Cluster analysis revealed a close relationship between <b>landraces</b> along geographic proximity with genetic distance between <b>landraces</b> increasing {{with an increase in}} geographic distance. The grouping of <b>landraces</b> based on districts was influenced by clinal trend and geographic proximity. The FST statistics showed significant geographic differentiation among <b>landraces</b> at various levels of predefined geographic origin but {{a large portion of the}} variation was among <b>landraces</b> within rather than between predefined populations. The <b>landraces</b> from North Shewa were predominantly in one cluster, and <b>landraces</b> from this area also exhibited the greatest allelic diversity and the highest number of private alleles. There was low variation among the highland Zengada <b>landraces,</b> but these <b>landraces</b> were quite strongly differentiated and fell into one population cluster. The low to moderate genetic differentiation between <b>landraces</b> from various geographic origins could be attributed to gene flow across the region as a consequence of seed exchange among farmers...|$|R
40|$|We used field {{experiments}} in Hani’s terraced fields in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Province, to compare 23 phenotypic traits of 135 paddy rice <b>landraces,</b> including 66 ones {{that used to}} be grown during the 1970 s (past-grown <b>landraces)</b> and 69 ones that have been grown during the past decade (current-grown <b>landraces).</b> Comparing 23 phenotypic traits, the average Shannon-Wiener diversity index of the past-grown <b>landraces</b> (H′ = 1. 784) was higher than that of the current-grown <b>landraces</b> (H′ = 1. 766), while the average coefficientsof variation and that of similarity of the past-grown (19. 5 % and 0. 2107, respectively) were lower than those of the current-grown (21. 7 % and 0. 2149, respectively). There were eight and six principal components with eigenvalues > 1 in the past-grown and current-grown <b>landraces,</b> respectively, accounting for 81. 4 % and 83. 2 % of their overall variation, respectively. Based on a cluster analysis of the 23 phenotypic traits and a scatter plot of the first three principal components, these <b>landraces</b> could be grouped into two subspecies, indica and japonica. There was a slightly lower proportion of the indica, waxy, and red pericarp color varieties,as well as strong seed-shattering types in the current-grown <b>landraces</b> than in the past-grown ones. Average plant height, panicle neck length, node length under spike, 1, 000 -grain weight and flag-leaf angle were all lower in the current-grown. On the other hand, average panicles per plant, flag-leaf width, filled grains per panicle and seed-setting rate increased in the current-grown <b>landraces.</b> In addition, the current-grown <b>landraces</b> had more compact plant types. The simplification and decrease in the genetic diversity of current- grown <b>landraces</b> compared to past-grown <b>landraces</b> may have resulted from the increased use of hybrid rice, selection for high yield traits, and less consideration of the traditional cultural habitude by local ethnic groups. More attention should be paid to both conservation of rice <b>landraces</b> {{as well as to the}} traditional rice culture in Yuanyang Hani’s terraced fields in Yunnan Province...|$|R

5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural <b>landrace</b> hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E

Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors {{may have been a}} <b>landrace</b> of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a local cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.|$|E
40|$|Collection and {{conservation}} of sorghum germplasm was accelerated about {{two decades ago}} because of the danger caused to the <b>landraces</b> by the release of new varieties and hybrids. For example, "Zera-zera" and "Hegari" <b>landraces</b> of sorghum once present in the Gezira province of Sudan are now completely out of cultivation (Prasada Rao and Mengesha 1980). Although <b>landraces</b> are still found in Africa and Asia in large areas, {{it is no longer}} safe to expect that the same situation will exist after another 10 years. Our recent experience shows that several primitive <b>landraces</b> once abundant in parts of Africa and Asia are now extinct. Therefore, we are now in a critical, transitional stage when there is an urgent need to collect and conserve the traditional <b>landraces</b> and their wild relatives at an accelerated pace...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{fingerprinting}} based genotype characterization {{and assessment}} of genetic diversity of fifteen wild <b>landraces</b> of Zingiber officinale. Roscoe, collected {{from different parts of}} northern West Bengal, India, has been done using 16 random decamer primers. Out of 117 amplified products, 97 bands showed polymorphism (82. 90 %) and an average of 7. 5 bands was amplified per primer. The genetic similarity coefficients among accessions ranged from 0. 673 to 0. 912 with an average of 0. 792. Cluster analysis based on Jaccard’s similarity coefficient using UPGMA grouped the <b>landraces</b> into three clusters: cluster I consisting of 5 <b>landraces,</b> Cluster II consisting of 6 <b>landraces,</b> and cluster III of 4 landraces; Antioxidant potential status of these genotypes exhibit variation that shows grouping comparable with the RAPD based dendogram (reflecting genetic relatedness) of the <b>landraces.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} among cultivated <b>landraces</b> and natural populations of Tatary buckwheat were investigated by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on RAPD markers. For RAPD analyses, 29 cultivated <b>landraces,</b> 17 wild subspecies and one weedy type were used. Three major groups were observed; (1) all cultivated <b>landraces</b> and wild subspecies from central Tibet and Pakistan including a weedy type, (2) wild subspecies from Yunnan province and (3) wild subspecies from Sichuan and Qinghai provinces. This {{suggests that a}} type of wild subspecies which distributes in central Tibet and Pakistan is the ancestor of cultivated Tatary buckwheat. However, the natural populations from central Tibet and Pakistan were so {{closely related to the}} cultivated Iandraces that they are suspected to be a escaped fonn from cultivated <b>landraces</b> or a hybrid derived between wild subspecies and <b>landraces...</b>|$|R
