2500|$|Some {{cutting fluids}} {{are used in}} aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny {{droplets}} of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere {{and all the time}} except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, [...] (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} Bulk Specialty Gas delivery Systems (BSGS) {{were designed}} and tested up to flow rates of 1000 slpm. Conventional gas delivery, conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> and a novel <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> system featuring Total Vaporization (TV) were compared {{in terms of}} product consistency {{and the amount of}} available ammonia from a bulk container. The delivered gas was monitored for moisture fluctuations as a function of flow rate and time. Results from the TV design showed consistent moisture levels at all flow rates, while both the gas and the conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> systems exhibited dramatic fluctuations in moisture concentration. Additionally, <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> systems supply continuous flow rates greater than 5000 slpm, while gas delivery systems can not sustain flow rates higher than 600 slpm due to heat transfer limitations. Furthermore, <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> enables the consumption of nearly the entire product, while maintaining constant moisture levels. Empirical evidence has shown that 96 % of the container's contents can be used if the <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> system is employed. However, with a gas or conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> system the impurity levels are uncontrollable and increase throughout the consumption of the bulk container. As a result, it is uncommon for the product to be completely consumed and purifier lifetime can not be accurately assessed...|$|E

40|$|During daily 3 -hr sessions, 5 rhesus monkeys drank drug {{solutions}} and water that were concurrently available. The drug solutions were: 1 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) pentobarbital (2 monkeys), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 0. 5 % ethanol (1 monkey), 1 mg/mL pentobarbital plus 1 % ethanol (1 monkey), and 8 % ethanol (1 monkey). The drug solution and water were available under identical two-component tandem fixed-ratio continuous-reinforcement N schedules. Two variables were manipulated: {{the size of}} the fixed-ratio component and the number of <b>liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> (N) in the second component. Deliveries of the drug solution maintained higher rates of responding than did deliveries of the drug vehicle, water. The number of drug deliveries per session increased with increases in the number of deliveries per fixed ratio and decreased with increases in fixed-ratio size. Analysis of the results in terms of the proportion of deliveries to responses showed that the number of drug deliveries per session was directly related to the size of this quotient. Finally, when fixed-ratio size was repeatedly doubled, the following orderly relationship emerged: The greater the number of available drug deliveries per fixed ratio, the less was the percent {{decrease in the number of}} fixed ratios completed per session.

40|$|For 4 rhesus monkeys, mouth-contact {{responses}} {{with either}} of two brass spouts were reinforced according to fixed-ratio schedules by 0. 65 -mL <b>liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> during daily 3 -hr sessions. Three experiments were conducted. In each experiment, independent fixed-ratio schedules were concurrently in effect at the two spouts. Following completion of each fixed ratio on a spout, a specified number of <b>liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> were available from that spout under a continuous-reinforcement schedule. The number of such deliveries available at each spout was manipulated independently. In Experiment 1, a 1 -mg/mL pentobarbital solution was simultaneously available with water (the drug vehicle) under concurrent fixed-ratio schedules of 32 responses for 3 subjects and 64 responses for the remaining subject. The number (N) of <b>liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> that were available after completion of each fixed ratio was varied in the following order: 8, 4, 2, 1, and 8 (retest). For each subject at each condition, drug maintained more responding than water. The number of drug deliveries obtained per session was {{directly related to the}} amount of drug available per fixed ratio (i. e., to N), whereas the number of fixed ratios completed per session generally was inversely related to the value of N. In Experiment 2, fixed-ratio size was the same for each subject as in Experiment 1, but deliveries of a 1 -mg/mL pentobarbital solution were available at both spouts. The number of drug deliveries available under one fixed-ratio schedule (Ns, the "standard" reinforcer amount) was held at eight, and the number of drug deliveries available under the second schedule (Nc, the "comparison" reinforcer amount) was changed across blocks of six sessions of stable responding in the following order: 1, 2, 4, 8, 4, 2, and 1. The identical series of comparison reinforcer amounts (Nc) was then tested twice more, but with the standard reinforcer (Ns) held first at four and then at two deliveries. Across the three choice series, reinforcing effects were directly related to reinforcer magnitude. In Experiment 3, deliveries of a 1 -mg/mL pentobarbital solution again were available at both spouts. However, the two reinforcer amounts were held constant at N = 8 deliveries under one schedule and N = 4 deliveries under the second schedule, and fixed-ratio size was systematically varied. Across the range of fixed-ratio sizes from low to high, the degree to which behavior was better maintained by the larger of the two drug quantities was an inverted U-shaped function of fixed-ratio size.

This report describes {{the results of}} a Phase 2 a study exploring the efficacy of a <b>liquid</b> nicotine <b>delivery</b> system as an aid to smoking cessation assessed after 12 weeks of therapy. Methods A single-arm Phase 2 a study was conducted. Community-based smokers (ages 18 + years, smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily for the past year and interested in making a quit attempt) were recruited and completed clinic visits at 2 week intervals over the 12 week study period where carbon monoxide levels were assessed and the Smoke-Break product was rated on taste and overall satisfaction. Participants were provided with a supply of liquid nicotine cigarettes (e. g., Smoke-Break) at each clinic visit. A total of 69 smokers were enrolled and received the intervention product (intention to treat group, ITT) and 52 smokers verified participation (according to protocol group, ATP). Results The cessation rate at 12 weeks after the baseline visit, assessed as the bioverified point prevalence of abstinence, was 71. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 58. 8 %- 83. 5 %) in the ATP group and 53. 6 % (41. 8 %- 65. 4 %) in the ITT group.

30|$|Precise {{control of}} sample volume {{is one of}} the most {{important}} functions in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, especially for chemical and biological reactions. The common approach used for <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> involves the employment of capillaries and microstructures for generating a droplet which has a volume in the nanoliter or picoliter range. Here, we report a novel approach for constructing a picoinjector which is based on well-controlled electroosmotic (EO) flow to electrokinetically drive sample solutions. This picoinjector comprises an array of interconnected nanochannels for <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery.</b> Such technique for <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> has the advantages of well-controlled sample volume and reusable nanofluidic chip, and it was reported for the first time. In the study of the pumping process for this picoinjector, the EO flow rate was determined by the intensity of the fluorescent probe. The influence of ion concentration in electrolyte solutions over the EO flow rate was also investigated and discussed. The application of this EO-driven picoinjector for chemical reactions was demonstrated by the reaction between Fluo- 4 and calcium chloride with the reaction cycle controlled by the applied square waves of different duty cycles. The precision of our device can reach down to picoliter per second, which is much smaller than that of most existing technologies. This new approach, thus, opens further possibilities of adopting nanofluidics for well-controlled chemical reactions with particular applications in nanoparticle synthesis, bimolecular synthesis, drug delivery, and diagnostic testing.|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} {{of the group}} II elements Ba and Sr is still the main problem for MOCVD processes of perovskite oxides. In order to overcome {{the problem of the}} low vapour pressure of the widely used beta -diketonate precursors, <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> techniques are applied, where the precursors are dissolved in a suitable solvent that can be handled at room temperature before being vaporized. Most of the commercially available <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> systems are based on flash evaporation, that means vaporization occurs in contact with a heated surface, which may result in partial decomposition of the chemicals. We report on an MOCVD system which is based on an aerosol-assisted vaporizer that provides a contact-free evaporation process.

40|$|Six monkeys self-administered orally {{delivered}} phencyclidine ("angel dust") and saccharin under concurrent fixed-ratio 16 schedules during daily three-hour sessions. <b>Liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> were {{contingent upon}} lip-contact responses on solenoid-operated drinking spouts. Three saccharin concentrations (0. 003 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 3 %, wt/vol) {{were tested in}} a nonsystematic order. For each saccharin concentration, the following series of phencyclidine concentrations (mg/ml) was presented: 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 0. 25 (retest), 0. 125, 0. 0625, 0. 0312, 0. 25 (retest) and 0 (water with stimuli signaling phencyclidine). As the saccharin concentration increased, the number of drug deliveries decreased, and the peaks of the concentration-response functions were shifted to the right. The lowest saccharin concentration (0. 003 %, wt/vol) maintained responding in excess of phencyclidine levels in only one monkey. The two higher saccharin concentrations maintained behavior far in excess of phencyclidine, but saccharin deliveries decreased in some monkeys as phencyclidine concentration and intake (mg/kg) increased. The time course and patterns of phencyclidine-reinforced responding were also altered when saccharin was concurrently available.

40|$|Performances {{of three}} rhesus monkeys were {{reinforced}} by the oral delivery of pentobarbital and studied as functions of fixed-ratio size and drug concentration. Pentobarbital solutions and water were concurrently available on identical reinforcement schedules from separate liquid-delivery systems during 3 -hour sessions. Under a fixed-ratio 16 schedule of drug availability, a descending series of drug concentrations was tested (4, 2, 1, 0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125, and 0. 0625 mg/ml, followed by a retest at 4 mg/ml). Partial concentration series beginning with the highest concentration were repeated with fixed-ratios of 32 and 64, with a fixed-ratio 128 for two monkeys, and with fixed-ratio 256 for one. At each fixed-ratio value, response rate and number of drug deliveries were inverted U-shaped functions of pentobarbital concentration. Drug intake (mg/kg/session) increased directly with drug concentration. As the fixed-ratio size was increased, the number of <b>liquid</b> <b>deliveries</b> decreased. For each drug concentration, when the numbers of drug deliveries at fixed-ratios of 32, 64, and 128 responses were plotted as percentages of those obtained at fixed-ratio 16, the following orderly relationship emerged: the higher the drug concentration, the less that drug deliveries were decreased by increases in fixed-ratio size.

Results show that compressed gas truck {{delivery is}} ideal for small stations and very low demand, <b>liquid</b> <b>delivery</b> for long distance delivery and moderate demand and pipeline delivery is ideal for dense areas with large hydrogen demand. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{different}} compositions within the (Ba-x,Sr 1 -x) TiO 3 solid solution series were deposited in a planetary multi-wafer MOCVD reactor using different solutions of Sr(thd) (2), Ba(thd) (2) and Ti(O-i-Pr) (2) (thd) (2) precursors. Structural and electrical properties of Pt/BST/Pt MIM structures are presented. On {{the base of}} film thickness series ranging from 10 to 150 nm the electrical permittivity is discussed within the dead layer model. The performance of two different <b>liquid</b> precursor <b>delivery</b> systems, characterized by flash evaporation and liquid injection, respectively, are compared for the example of different SrTiO 3 films. Finally, the growth of SrTiO 3 on Pt(111) is compared with the growth on Si(100) and the electrical characteristics of the Pt/STO/Si MIS structures are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Perfluorochemical (perfluorocarbon) {{molecules}} {{have very}} different structures that impart different physical properties such as respiratory gas solubility, density, viscosity, vapor pressure, and lipid solubility. Thus, {{it is critical to}} choose the appropriate PFC for a specific biomedical application, such as <b>liquid</b> ventilation, drug <b>delivery</b> or blood substitutes. The physical properties of PFC liquids vary substantially; however, the one common property is their high solubility for respiratory gases. In fact, these liquids carry more oxygen and carbon dioxide than blood.|$|R
30|$|Piezoelectric pumps can be sorted by two types, valveless {{piezoelectric}} {{pumps and}} valve ones, {{according to whether}} they have an internal moving part (valve) or not. Zhang et al. [25] proposed a piezoelectric pump with rotatable unsymmetrical slopes {{which could be used}} to piezoelectric <b>liquid</b> mixing and <b>delivery</b> together or separately. Yang et al. [26] designed a bidirectional valveless piezoelectric micropump with double chambers. This pump has better performance at low Reynolds number and can change the flow direction by regulating the voltage.|$|R
