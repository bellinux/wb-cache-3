5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> used in {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics {{is also being}} phased out by some countries {{to reduce the amount}} of environmentally hazardous waste. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} to have resulted in 853,000 deaths. It occurs most commonly in the developing world. Those who are poor are at greater risk. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to}} result in 0.6% of the world's disease burden. People have been mining and using lead for thousands of years. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 1500s. Concerns for low levels of exposure begin in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure.|$|E
50|$|Sales <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> {{generated}} {{on the basis}} of demographic criteria such as FICO score, income, age, household income, psychographic, etc. These <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> resold to multiple advertisers. Sales <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> typically followed up through phone calls by the sales force. Sales <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> commonly found in the mortgage, insurance and finance leads.|$|R
50|$|Marketing <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> brand-specific <b>leads</b> {{generated}} for {{a unique}} advertiser offer. In direct contrast to sales <b>leads</b> marketing <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> sold only once. Because transparency {{is a necessary}} requisite for generating marketing leads, marketing <b>lead</b> campaigns can <b>be</b> optimized by mapping leads to their sources.|$|R
50|$|Rusinow <b>leads</b> <b>is</b> {{a bridge}} {{convention}} used {{as part of}} defensive carding. Rusinow <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> commonly used only on the opening lead against a suit contract; nevertheless, some experts use Rusinow leads only against notrump.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} incorporated into herbal remedies such as Indian Ayurvedic preparations and remedies of Chinese origin. There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> {{removed from}} the body very slowly, mainly through urine. Smaller amounts of lead are also {{eliminated}} through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme {{was killed}} in an action of dubious motivations. Several {{different}} terrorist <b>leads</b> <b>were</b> considered, but none has been proved conclusive, and the police main <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> a lone madman.|$|R
50|$|For example, for a 14-lead DIP, {{with the}} notch at the top, the left <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> {{numbered}} from 1 to 7 (top to bottom) {{and the right}} row of <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> numbered 8 to 14 (bottom to top).|$|R
2500|$|An {{intracardiac}} electrogram (ICEG) {{is essentially}} an ECG with some added intracardiac <b>leads</b> (that <b>is,</b> inside the heart). The standard ECG <b>leads</b> (external <b>leads)</b> <b>are</b> I, II, III, aVL, V1, and V6. Two to four intracardiac <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> added via cardiac catheterization. The word [...] "electrogram" [...] (EGM) without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram.|$|R
5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

25|$|Cox was {{tentatively}} cast as Tristan, but {{to ensure}} the leads had chemistry on screen Vaughn would not confirm the casting until both <b>leads</b> <b>were</b> cast. Vaughn had Cox audition alongside the prospective leading actresses until the female <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> cast.|$|R
50|$|Sales <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> {{generated}} {{on the basis}} of demographic criteria such as FICO score, income, age, HHI, etc. These <b>leads</b> may <b>be</b> exclusive (sold only to one advertiser) or non-exclusive (sold to multiple advertisers). Sales <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> typically followed-up through phone calls by the sales force and are commonly available {{for a wide range of}} verticals including mortgage, insurance and home services.|$|R
5|$|As much as 80% of {{the lead}} in very high-content initial {{concentrates}} can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all {{of the lead}} can be oxidized to a high-lead slag. Metallic <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> further obtained from the high-lead (25–40%) slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E

50|$|When {{actively}} mined, {{the silver}} vein of argentiferous galena (silver-bearing <b>lead)</b> <b>was</b> large and well defined. The silver and <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> easily milled and smelted. The <b>lead</b> content sometimes <b>was</b> {{as much as}} 50 per cent of the ore, and assays proved the silver content ran as high as $105.00 per ton in 1881 dollars.|$|R
50|$|One ancient {{process for}} extracting the silver from <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> cupellation. <b>Lead</b> <b>was</b> melted in a bone ash 'test' or 'cupel' and air blown across the surface. This {{oxidised}} {{the lead to}} litharge, troy ounces of silver per ton of lead (178 ppm).|$|R
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. <b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only about a third of <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character {{is illustrated by}} its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E

25|$|<b>Lead</b> may <b>be</b> {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in <b>lead</b> glass could <b>be</b> obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, <b>lead</b> sulfide, <b>was</b> widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The <b>lead</b> metal would <b>be</b> calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the litharge. In the medieval period <b>lead</b> metal could <b>be</b> obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. <b>Lead</b> <b>was</b> also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; {{it can be}} scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} {{and for its}} lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt classification, meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur. It rarely occurs in its native, metallic form. Many lead minerals are relatively light and, {{over the course of}} the Earth's history, have remained in the crust instead of sinking deeper into the Earth's interior. This accounts for lead's relatively high crustal abundance of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most abundant element in the crust.|$|E

50|$|Older pewters {{with higher}} <b>lead</b> content <b>are</b> heavier, tarnish faster, and {{oxidation}} {{gives them a}} darker silver-gray color. Pewters containing <b>lead</b> <b>are</b> no longer used in items (such as cups, plates, or jewelry) that will {{come in contact with}} the human body due to health concerns stemming from the lead content. Modern pewters are available that are completely free of lead, although many pewters containing <b>lead</b> <b>are</b> still being produced for other purposes.|$|R
