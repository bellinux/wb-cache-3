5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> this hypothesis, as {{their dependence on}} parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it {{remained}} successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon {{is thought to}} have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could be construed to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out {{at the same time that}} most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On the {{approach}} to and during an actual battle, a well-ordered formation was critical: if a fleet fell into disorder, its ships {{would be unable to}} <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> each other and probably would be defeated. Fleets that failed to keep an ordered formation or that could not order themselves into an appropriate counter-formation (antiparataxis) to match that of the enemy, often avoided, or broke off from battle. Tactical manoeuvres were therefore intended to disrupt the enemy formation, including the use of various , such as dividing one's force and carrying out flanking manoeuvres, feigning retreat or hiding a reserve in ambush (Tactica, XIX.52–56). Indeed, Leo VI openly advised (Tactica, XIX.36) against direct confrontation and advocates the use of stratagems instead. According to Leo VI (Tactica, XIX.52), a crescent formation seems to have been the norm, with the flagship in the centre and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. A range of variants and other tactics and counter-tactics was available, depending on the circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments {{posted on}} the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, {{captured}} the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward {{a gap in the}} Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers {{in this part of the}} line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge.|$|E

25|$|Tillman Vetter, {{although}} agreeing overall with Gomez's observations, suggests some refinements {{on historical}} and doctrinal grounds. First, {{he notes that}} neither of these short collections of suttas are homogeneous and hence are not all amenable to Gomez' proposals. According to Vetter, those suttas which do <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> Gomez probably originated with a heterodox ascetic group that pre-dated the Buddha, and were integrated into the Buddhist Sangha at an early date, bringing with them some suttas that were already in existence and also composing further suttas in which they tried to combine their own teachings {{with those of the}} Buddha.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{scholars}} {{feel that the}} dating of Thomas rightfully belongs no later than 200CE B. Grenfell and A.

Additionally, an investigation of the text provides internal evidence that suggests a date of authorship to be the beginning of the 2ndCentury.

25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> the theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them {{is to be found}} a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, DNA {{tests have}} {{demonstrated}} substantially less inter-marriage {{in most of}} the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations. The findings <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations — in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim — it is unlikely that they formed {{a large percentage of the}} ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia, and new provisions for maternity were introduced.

A Socialisation Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the workers' councils.

25|$|The age and stratigraphic {{equivalents}} of the Hoy sandstone sequence are {{a matter}} of continuing debate. Traditionally {{the presence of an}} unconformity {{at the base of the}} lavas beneath these sandstones on southwestern Hoy has been interpreted to mark a major time break. More recent studies have suggested that this unconformity is of only local significance as a hiatus of this age has not been recognised elsewhere in the Orcadian Basin sequence. It has been proposed that the Hoy sandstones are the lateral equivalents of the Eday Group, the thickness and associated facies changes being caused by active extensional faulting during deposition. The presence of lavas within the Eday Flagstone Formation has been used to <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> this idea, but differences in the chemistry between these lavas and those on Hoy mean that such a correlation remains uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Both of Montoto's {{children}} with Raverta {{went on to}} work in the group HIJOS in Mar del Plata. Fernanda studied at the University of Mar del Plata and became a social worker. She also became president of the Asociación Civil Sol de Mayo, an NGO created in 2007. Her relationship with her father is “almost nil.” His daughter Fernanda Raverta, who was born in November 1973 and who was three years old when her mother was kidnapped, served manager of the headquarters of ANSES (Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social), Argentina's social-security administration, under the agency's executive director Diego Bossio.

25|$|Glossopteris {{leaves are}} morphologically simple {{so there are}} few {{characters}} {{that can be used}} to differentiate species. Consequently, many past researchers have considered the Permian Glossopteris flora to be rather homogeneous with the same species distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere. However, more recent studies of the more morphologically diverse fertile organs have shown that taxa had more restricted regional distributions and several intra-gondwanan floristic provinces are recognizable. Seeds, much too large to be wind-borne, could not have blown across thousands of miles of open sea, nor is it likely they have floated across vast oceans. Observations such as these led the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to deduce that there had once been a land bridge between these areas. He named this large land mass Gondwanaland (named after the district in India where the plant Glossopteris was found). These same observations would also <b>lend</b> <b>support</b> <b>to</b> Alfred Wegener's Continental drift theory.|$|E
