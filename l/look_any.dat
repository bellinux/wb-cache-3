He hurried to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E

MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and {{towards the end of}} their seasons, [...] "...you see a lot more sex jokes and bodily function jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried".

500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Any</b> Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, that is really effective." ...|$|E

Manning, when speaking about this to Joshua Rotter of Download.com, said that she immediately accepted the offer [...] "I loved it and didn't need to <b>look</b> <b>any</b> further. I was sold." [...] To prepare for the role, Manning did some research on faith healing and evangelistic ceremonies. She also states that her inspiration for Doggett at least partly comes from the White family in the 2009 documentary film The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia. The only make-up that Manning wears for her role as Doggett, in the first season, is on her teeth to create the effect of receding gums and missing teeth. From the second season onwards, however, Doggett has false teeth in place and so the teeth seen are Manning's own.|$|E

Time seems to slow slow down as another inmate, Donnie Pfaster (Nick Chinlund)a [...] "death fetishist" [...] and serial killer who kidnapped Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) five years earlierwalks {{out of the room}} and leaves the prison. Hearing about the escape, Scully and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) investigate. They learn that three men escaped from three prisons, all of whom had contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison (Scott Wilson). Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs him over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the song [...] "Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Any</b> Further" [...] everywhere she goes, soon believing it is a sign.

500|$|... "Hit 'Em Up" [...] is a diss song by rap artist 2Pac {{featuring}} {{his group}} the Outlawz. It is the B-side {{to the single}} [...] "How Do U Want It", released on June 4, 1996. The song’s lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chief among them, Shakur's former friend turned rival, The Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls. The song was recorded in Los Angeles, California at Can Am Studios in May 1996. Reporter Chuck Philips, who interviewed Shakur at Can Am, described the song as [...] "a caustic anti-East Coast crusade in which the rapper threatens to eliminate Biggie, Sean Combs (Puffy), {{and a slew of}} Bad Boy artists and other New York acts." [...] The song was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny [...] "J" [...] and samples the bassline from [...] "Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Any</b> Further" [...] by Dennis Edwards and interpolates [...] "Get Money" [...] by Biggie Smalls group Junior M.A.F.I.A., which used the Dennis Edwards sample as well. The video, itself described as infamous, includes impersonations of Biggie, Puffy and Lil' Kim.|$|E

500|$|The bassline in [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] {{is taken}} from the 1984 Dennis Edwards song [...] "Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Any</b> Further". The chorus of [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] is a play on the chorus of Junior M.A.F.I.A's [...] "Player's Anthem." [...] The phrase [...] "take money" [...] is {{repeated}} throughout the song, which is a play on Junior M.A.F.I.A's recent release [...] "Get Money", {{which is also the}} beat used in [...] "Hit 'Em Up". Faith Evans, who at the time was Biggie's estranged wife, was reportedly seen with Shakur after a public breakup with Biggie. Journalist Chuck Philips spotted Faith Evans at Can Am when he interviewed Shakur a year earlier in 1995. People at the studio told the reporter that Faith Evans also contributed—that the R chanteuse recorded one or more “Take Money” background vocals that would appear on “Hit Em Up.” In his October 1995 interview of the rapper, Philips remembered in 2012, [...] "I was so unaware of the bi-coastal rap war that I suspected nothing when Faith Evans appeared with Shakur at Can Am. The estranged wife of Biggie was recording background vocals for [...] "Wonda Why They Call U Bitch", a song which was at the time yet to be released. According to Shakur she had given him gifts of clothing, which he offered as proof of a relationship in an interview. Using this against Biggie in [...] "Hit 'Em Up", Shakur continued to fuel the rumors of a sexual relationship with Evans in the song's line [...] "You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife." [...] Claims of an affair with Evans appear three times in the song.|$|E

The song was originally recorded and released in December 1999 upon Mary Mary's signing with Columbia Records and was re-released one month later as a promotional single for their upcoming debut album, Thankful.

[...] Woodson was a Detroit native {{who had been a}} potential candidate to replace Dennis Edwards back in 1977.

2500|$|In 1932, The Guardian {{reported}} on a trend for frocks based around designs by the French Impressionists, adding: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} they should <b>look</b> <b>any</b> more ridiculous than the Empress Eugénie hats that every other woman was wearing a few months ago". [...] In 1933, The Times reported that milliners were drawing on both the 18th century and the Second French Empire for inspiration, singling out Suzanne Talbot as showing styles similar to Empress Eugénie's riding hats and designs with trims turned up sharply on one side. A wide variety of materials were being used, including taffetas, straw and grosgrain. A year later, the Eugénie hat was still being adapted as part of new season's millinery designs, but now showing more of women's hairstyles: [...] "Hats are halo-like or sailor-like, but with considerable flatness.

2500|$|Those {{familiar}} with Japanese writing may notice {{that most of}} the differences apply to words which are usually written in Kanji anyway, and so would require no changes to switch from one Kana system to another (unless furigana are employed).

A Scare at Bedtime, first aired in 1997, is close to being the polar opposite of this, with extremely adult content, lewd jokes and slightly obscene anecdotes being related by the two puppets. Their origins on the Den are largely ignored, as the backstory gradually established on A Scare at Bedtime, presents them to be both in their fifties (although they don't <b>look</b> <b>any</b> different from how they used to), and residing in Ballydung Manor, the former Ballydung Asylum. Rumour has it that their parents left them in the asylum many years ago, and in revenge, Rodge took an axe to them both. But no bodies were ever found.
