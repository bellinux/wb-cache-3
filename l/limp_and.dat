5|$|The {{following}} month, Abebe {{returned to}} Tokyo {{to win his}} second Mainichi Marathon. In 1966 he ran marathons at Zarautz and Inchon–Seoul, winning both. The following year, Abebe did not finish the Zarautz International Marathon in July 1967. He had injured his hamstring, an injury from which he would never recover. Abebe had begun to <b>limp,</b> <b>and</b> the 1966 Incheon–Seoul Marathon was the last marathon he ever completed.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again {{served in}} the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain {{in charge of a}} troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen's {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{that was part of the}} 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army's sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. For the rest of his life he would walk with a <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With {{the help of the}} cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor <b>limp,</b> <b>and</b> long spells of fielding left him in pain.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} from the war, Byron, <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> all, returned to racing, {{and with the help}} of race engineer Red Vogt was still successful. He won his first race following the war at Seminole Speedway, near Orlando, in 1946, beating Roy Hall and Bill France. In 1948, Byron became a part of the newly formed NASCAR Modified Series racing with Raymond Parks' team.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003 Persson was diagonosed with hip {{osteoarthritis}} {{and surgery}} was recommended. He {{chose to go}} through Sweden's public health-care system instead of seeking private treatment; he was put on a waiting list, and finally received a hip replacement operation in June 2004. During that 9-month period he walked with a <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.|$|E
25|$|In October 1902, Mother Amadeus {{traveled}} to Miles City, Montana, via train. Her east-bound train crashed head-on into a west-bound train. Her hip was broken, and Mother Amadeus spent nine {{weeks in a}} hospital in Helena. The primitive system of weights attached to her ankles (used as traction to keep the hip bones in place) did not work properly, and she walked with a severe <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> used a cane {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E

25|$|In September, while touring Tasmania, the shy and {{sensitive}} Bower {{was found in}} his room in extreme distress, the promoter insisting they had to perform; {{faced with the prospect}} of going unpaid and being stranded in Hobart, they complied. Bower was dressed, taken to the concert and pushed on stage with his guitar around his neck; he stood motionless through the gig, arms hanging <b>limp,</b> <b>and</b> was hospitalised immediately after, suffering a severe nervous breakdown, and was ordered to give up performing. He was sent home to Adelaide to recuperate, and only returned to live performance in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|He wielded {{great power}} through this enterprise: in early 1992, after being shot during a pit-bull fight, doctors at Koševo {{hospital}} were hesitant {{to perform the}} necessary operation due to the great risk involved. In response, Prazina's small army besieged the hospital and forced the surgeons to attempt the job. Although a bullet remained (causing {{him to have a}} <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> reduced range of motion on his left hand {{for the rest of his}} life), Prazina ultimately survived and continued his activities. By the time the Yugoslav crisis was underway, Prazina had been arrested and jailed five times, and was a well-known figure in Sarajevo's underworld.|$|E
25|$|Craddock {{planned a}} career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new Triumph motorcycle. In July 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was {{shattered}} in a motorcycle crash. He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg {{for the rest of his}} life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him, but some claim Craddock had been riding drunk. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea. He spent time in the Portsmouth Naval Hospital and was medically discharged from the Navy shortly thereafter.|$|E

From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne's first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day. Lee shot around fifty takes, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from hypothermia. Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted phlebitis in her leg, developed a <b>limp,</b> <b>and</b> sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.|$|E

500|$|Polydore Vergil and Thomas More {{expanded}} on this portrayal, emphasising Richard's outward physical deformities {{as a sign}} of his inwardly twisted mind. More describes him as [...] "little of stature, ill-featured of limbs, crook-backed... hard-favoured of visage". Vergil {{also says}} he was [...] "deformed of body... one shoulder higher than the right". Both emphasise that Richard was devious and flattering, while planning the downfall of both his enemies and supposed friends. Richard's good qualities were his cleverness and bravery. All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who portrays him as having a hunch, a <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> a withered arm.|$|E
500|$|This attack {{resulted}} in {{an extended period of}} wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed [...] "shorter than the other" [...] (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs [...] "Zomby Woof" [...] and [...] "Dancin' Fool"), resulting in chronic back pain. Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.|$|E

60|$|This tirade against destiny {{went on for}} an hour or more, {{and then}} he buckled to his work, <b>limping</b> <b>and</b> groaning, and in his eyes a great hatred for all created things.

500|$|Coloman's father {{ascended the}} throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors {{when he died}} on 25April 1077, Géza's brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman should be {{prepared}} {{for a career in}} the Church. The king's decision was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle stated that Coloman was [...] "of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension", adding that he was [...] "shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, and he walked with a <b>limp</b> <b>and</b> stammered in his speech". If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle's decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.|$|E
500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had dark brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced <b>limp</b> <b>and,</b> while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

[...] Albert was tended to by two nurses who happened to be present during the accident. The Gores spent the next month in the hospital with Albert.
