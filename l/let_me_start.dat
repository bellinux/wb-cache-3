6000|$|... "What {{will you}} drink?" [...] resumed Gregory, {{with the same}} {{careless}} yet apologetic air. [...] "I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself; I have dined. But the champagne can really be trusted. Do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> you with a half-bottle of Pommery at least?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> off at once," [...] {{returned}} Peter, eagerly. [...] "I've {{a pretty}} good guess, from your description, where you left them. Besides, the gale is not so bad now. After an hour's sleep {{you will be able}} to start fresh, maybe overtake me. Jess will be sure to waken you in--" ...|$|E

40|$|First of all, I’d like {{to thank}} Prof. Dr. Demeyer for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> with a thesis on this subject. At {{the time of the}} {{proposal}} I had barely an idea in which direction I wanted to research. Many thanks goes out to LORE-assistants Hans, Andy and Filip, who were always open for questions and helped me pushing the research in the right direction. Benny helped me with his more thorough knowledge of the English language to limit the amount of mistakes against spelling and grammar. I also enjoyed discussing some matters with Steven. A special loving thank you goes to my girlfriend An, who supported me along the way with her continuous patience while the thesis got priority. In times when I was walking across the house murmuring all kinds of weird terms, my family let it quietly happen and gave me the tranquillity necessary to create sound theories. Thank you for that...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I haven't a darned cent {{to bless}} myself with," [...] Trent {{answered}} curtly. [...] "I've {{got to have}} ready money. I've never had my fist on five thousand pounds before--no, nor five thousand pence, but, as I'm a living man, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have my <b>start</b> and I'll hold my own with you all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Lordy massy! boys, your {{questions}} tumbles {{over each other}} thick as martins out o' a martin-box. Now, you jest be moderate and let alone, and I'll {{tell you all about}} it from the beginnin' to the end.

You don't imagine they'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> for Las Palmas? Surveys, reports, repairs and sending for another tug, might cost two or three thousand pounds. Then half my crew are sick and some are helpless, though I reckon they'll pick up sooner at sea than in an African hospital." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{an unhappy}} life that I lived; and its one {{dominant}} anxiety, towering over all its other anxieties, {{like a high}} mountain above a range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause for fear arose. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> from my bed as I would, with the terror fresh upon {{me that he was}} discovered; let me sit listening, as I would with dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.|$|E
40|$|A proof {{assistant}} is {{a computer}} program that is used for proving theorems in an interactive way. Many proof assistants {{are based on the}} theory of pure type systems and the propositions as types principle. During this master project a proof assistant has been developed that has such a theoretic foundation, but instead of using the ordinary pure type system framework, it uses a pure type system framework that is extended with additional type constructors. Initially, {{it was supposed to be}} implemented by using the FoolProof components to test their usability. One of FoolProof main features is its ability to manipulate terms with binding structures. When it turned out those components were not available in time, the decision was made to use the infrastructure of Cocktail instead, which manipulates terms with binding structures in the same way as FoolProof. Acknowledgements I am grateful to my supervisor Kees Hemerik for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> immediately on my master project when I asked him to be my supervisor. It did not take him long to come up with a research subject that I liked to investigate. When the progress of the project stalled due t...|$|R
40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>start</b> by thanking {{everyone}} {{who responded to}} my editorial entitled: ‘Why and How is Compassion Necessary to Provide Good Quality Healthcare?’ 1 It is both a humbling and deeply gratifying experience, to receive so many thoughtful and valuable comments from colleagues whose work I know and respect. And it is in equal measure, rewarding and stimulating, {{to be able to}} read engaging and incisive responses from colleagues I have never met but whose writings inspire me. These are rare gifts to be cherished, and they remind me of my privileged position as a member of the virtual community where such a genuine exchange of ideas takes place...|$|R
40|$|Debates about Christian {{privilege}} today often {{center on}} whether the United States was founded as a Christian nation. On {{one side of the}} argument are writers such as Terry Eastland, David Barton, and also Roy Stewart Moore, the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who believe that the United States was founded, whether officially or unofficially, as a Christian nation. As Terry Eastland (1984) phrases it in his defense of a specifically Protestant Christian privilege: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> therefore <b>start</b> with these propositions: that there was a principal religion in American life from 1620 until roughly 1920; that this religion was Protestant Christianity; and that Protestant Christianity has been our established religion in almost every sense of the phrase (p. 50) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will let}} you get {{anything}} you like, including a composing draught for yourself,' said Thomas, irritably alluding to his fellow-apprentice's inexhaustible activity, 'if you will only sit quiet for five minutes longer, and hear me out. I say again the horse is a betrayer of the confidence reposed in him; and that opinion, let me add, is drawn from my own personal experience, and {{is not based on}} any fanciful theory whatever. You shall have two instances, two overwhelming instances. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> the first of these by asking, what is the distinguishing quality which the Shetland Pony has arrogated to himself, and is still perpetually trumpeting through the world by means of popular report and books on Natural History? I see the answer in your face: it is the quality of being Sure-Footed. He professes to have other virtues, such as hardiness and strength, which you may discover on trial; but the one thing which he insists on your believing, when you get on his back, is that he may be safely depended on not to tumble down with you. Very good. Some years ago, I was in Shetland with a party of friends. They insisted on taking me with them {{to the top of a}} precipice that overhung the sea. It was a great distance off, but they all determined to walk to it except me. I was wiser then than I was with you at Carrock, and I determined to be carried to the precipice. There was no carriage-road in the island, and nobody offered (in consequence, as I suppose, of the imperfectly- civilised state of the country) to bring me a sedan-chair, which is naturally what I should have liked best. A Shetland pony was produced instead. I remembered my Natural History, I recalled popular report, and I got on the little beast's back, as any other man would have done in my position, placing implicit confidence in the sureness of his feet. And how did he repay that confidence? Brother Francis, carry your mind on from morning to noon. Picture to yourself a howling wilderness of grass and bog, bounded by low stony hills. Pick out one particular spot in that imaginary scene, and sketch me in it, with outstretched arms, curved back, and heels in the air, plunging headforemost into a black patch of water and mud. Place just behind me the legs, the body, and the head of a sure-footed Shetland pony, all stretched flat on the ground, and you will have produced an accurate representation of a very lamentable fact. And the moral device, Francis, of this picture will be to testify that when gentlemen put confidence in the legs of Shetland ponies, they will find to their cost that they are leaning on nothing but broken reeds. There is my first instance-- and what have you got to say to that?' ...|$|E

5000|$|Born in 1972, David Sitek {{grew up in}} Columbia, Maryland, {{together}} with his brothers. His mother worked in public education {{with a degree in}} child psychology and, according to Sitek, [...] "was pretty good about letting me and my brothers explore things. So much so that she <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> a hardcore band and practice in our house when I was 14". Sitek developed an interest in music at an early age influenced by his [...] "aunt Paula who snuck out of the house see Jimi Hendrix in the 60s, and was really into Talking Heads and Blondie".|$|E
40|$|When Jim Kurose {{invited me}} to write a piece for the “recommended reading ” series in CCR, I {{thought it would be}} a fun {{exercise}} and accepted the invitation right away. Little did I realize how challenging it would be to put together this list, as much because I was only allowed to pick 10 papers as because I had to steer clear of the many fine papers that had already been picked in previous lists. It has nevertheless been an enjoyable experience and I thank Jim for providing me with this opportunity. I also thank him, Zahir Koradia, and Ram Ramjee for their comments on this article. Rather than focusing on a single topic, I decided to pick papers from across sub-areas of networking that have left a lasting impression on me (and quite possibly on other researchers as well) because of their elegance, the insights they provide, and in many cases both of these. I hope many readers will enjoy reading these papers, if they have not already done so. Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get <b>started</b> with the list. Adaptation is a key aspect, indeed requirement, of any networked protocol or system. The first few papers in my list focus on various aspects of adaptation. We will start with...|$|R

5000|$|The way {{we write}} changes with each song. [...] "Keep Your Head" [...] started with Jules Martino on the drums, [...] "We Walk" [...] <b>started</b> with <b>me</b> on piano, [...] "Shut Up and <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Go" [...] <b>started</b> with Jules on bass, [...] "That's Not My Name" [...] was me ranting about my frustrations with the record industry. [...] "Great DJ" [...] was me playing a D chord on the guitar for hours, because that's all I could play. And then I {{put my finger}} on the wrong string, and got what I {{discovered}} was an augmented chord. And that was the riff! The lyrics described the life we were living at the time. It was about getting lost in hedonism, about forgetting that you had bailiffs knocking at your door and just surrendering to the joys of the music in a nightclub for several hours—the boys, the girls, the strings, the drums.|$|R
50|$|Everybody keeps {{asking me}} why I {{am no longer}} down with the Terror Squad. To answer everyone's question, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> by {{saying that there is}} no beef. I left Fat Joe's camp like a gentlemen. I wish him and his family nothing but the best. But it was time for Tony Sunshine to stand on his own two feet and become a leader of his own movement.So now I'm a free agent. But I {{recently}} signed a management deal with Darrin 'Dee' Dean. The C.E.O. of Ruff Ryders Entertainment. And the rest is about to become history. I have a new road manager, d.j., street team, etc. So expect to see a new and improved Tony Sunshine for 2008. This is going to be my year. Not my summer! Dee has me currently working in the studio with producers like Swizz Beats & Neo Da Matrix. So expect new hot music from Tony Sunshine very soon. I need my fans to understand that I was going through a lot of industry bullshit. And that is the reason you have not heard new music from Tony Sunshine. But it is 'FINALLY' over. And I 'FINALLY' got the clearance to do me. And that's exactly what I'm going to do.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was with}} Dylan {{at a party}} when he said to Mick Jagger, [...] "Are you serious about what you write and play and sing? You can't be serious about your music." ... That gave me a handle on what {{happened}} to George the Beatles. People who knew Bob would get this feeling, [...] "Take everything I've done and throw it out and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> over again." [...] - Photographer Barry Feinstein, commenting on Bob Dylan's influence on George Harrison and other musicians in the 1960s Bob Dylan first met the Beatles in New York City in August 1964, {{at the height of}} the band's fame. The meeting was arranged by New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who later remarked on the significance of this introduction: [...] "Hasn't the whole world benefited? ... The Beatles' magic was in their sound. Bob's magic was in his words. After they met, the Beatles' words got grittier, and Bob invented folk-rock." [...] Author Gary Tillery has written of the connection established between Dylan and George Harrison: [...] "Dylan was particularly keen on meeting John Lennon, the writer-artist-intellectual of the group, but the deepest and longest-lasting bond begun that night was with George Harrison. Their two reclusive personalities meshed ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> this {{discussion}} {{by pointing out}} that I am not anti-gun. I'm pro-knife. Consider the merits of the knife.In the first place, you have to catch up with someone in order to stab him. A general substitution of knives for guns would promote physical fitness. We'd turn into a whole nation of great runners. Plus, knives don't ricochet. And people are seldom killed while cleaning their knives.As a civil libertarian, I of course support the Second Amendment. And I believe it means exactly what it says: [...] "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, {{the right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." [...] Fourteen-year-old boys are not part of a well-regulated militia. Members of wacky religious cults are not part of a well-regulated militia. Permitting unregulated citizens to have guns is destroying the security of this free state.I am intrigued by the arguments of those who claim to follow the judicial doctrine of original intent. How do they know it was the dearest wish of Thomas Jefferson's heart that teen-age drug dealers should cruise the cities of this nation perforating their fellow citizens with assault rifles? Channelling? ...|$|E

5000|$|On 16 April 2011, {{while driving}} {{to address a}} public meeting in Victoria Falls at the {{invitation}} of Uluntu Ciisi Trust, just after passing the grounds where Lupane Government complex is pegged he was stopped by a police road block. The junior officers advised him that their superiors at the camp had sent for him and he should pass by. [...] "I debated with myself on whether to pass by the station on my way to or from Victoria Falls but eventually said <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> there lest the police think I am running away and mount yet another roadblock and treat me like a fugitive ahead. As I took a turn by Lupane Service station I discovered that indeed there was another roadblock which, I presume, had I not turned would have been nasty. I instantly alerted my lawyers and my political colleagues and psyched myself up for the worst which was clearly inevitable" [...] The ex-combatant would then celebrate the country's 31st Independence and other weeks to follow behind bars and in a heavy search for justice.He was summarily accused of contravening the notorious Criminal Law (Codification) and Reform Act by attending a church prayer meeting at Silwane Primary School in Lupane and encouraging attendants to speak openly about their grievances.However the greatest and real crime is his leadership style. Soon after his appointment in October 2010, Mzila introduced a new people-centered approach to the task of ONHRI. He began to attend civic society meetings and church gatherings in rural areas encouraging victims of atrocities to speak openly about their problems and prescribe solutions thereof. This irked the state and a plethora of plots against him were made. These included denying him fuel to travel from Harare to Matebeleland, breaking into his office, his arrest on 16 April 2011, subsequent harassment and humiliation and draconian bail conditions which he later appealed against and won.|$|E
