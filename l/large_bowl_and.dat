60|$|It {{was one of}} the brimstone-and-treacle mornings, and Mrs Squeers {{had entered}} school {{according}} to custom with the <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> spoon, followed by Miss Squeers and the amiable Wackford: who, during his father's absence, had taken upon him such minor branches of the executive as kicking the pupils with his nailed boots, pulling the hair of some of the smaller boys, pinching the others in aggravating places, and rendering himself, in various similar ways, a great comfort and happiness to his mother. Their entrance, whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse, was the signal of revolt. While one detachment rushed to the door and locked it, and another mounted on the desks and forms, the stoutest (and consequently the newest) boy seized the cane, and confronting Mrs Squeers with a stern countenance, snatched off her cap and beaver bonnet, put them on his own head, armed himself with the wooden spoon, and bade her, on pain of death, go down upon her knees and take a dose directly. Before that estimable lady could recover herself, or offer the slightest retaliation, she was forced into a kneeling posture by a crowd of shouting tormentors, and compelled to swallow a spoonful of the odious mixture, rendered more than usually savoury by the immersion in the bowl of Master Wackford's head, whose ducking was intrusted to another rebel. The success of this first achievement prompted the malicious crowd, whose faces were clustered together in every variety of lank and half-starved ugliness, to further acts of outrage. The leader was insisting upon Mrs Squeers repeating her dose, Master Squeers was undergoing another dip in the treacle, and a violent assault had been commenced on Miss Squeers, when John Browdie, bursting open the door with a vigorous kick, rushed to the rescue. The shouts, screams, groans, hoots, and clapping of hands, suddenly ceased, and a dead silence ensued.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#l] The proper hire of {{a return}} {{dromedary}} from Cairo to Suez is forty piastres. But every man is charged in proportion to his rank, and Europeans generally pay about double. [FN#2] The tender traveller had better provide himself {{with a pair of}} stirrups, but he will often find, when on camel back, that his legs are more numbed by hanging down, than by the Arab way of crossing them before and beneath the pommel. He must, however, be careful to inspect his saddle, and, should bars of wood not suit him, to have them covered with stuffed leather. And again, for my part, I would prefer riding a camel with a nose-ring,-Mongol and Sindian fashion,-to holding him, as the Egyptians do, with a halter, or to guiding him,-Wahhabiwise,-with a stick. [FN#3] [...] "O pilgrim!" [...] The Egyptians write the word Hajj, and pronounce Hagg. In Persia, India, and Turkey, it becomes Haji. These are mere varieties of form, derived from one and the same Arabic root. [FN#4] The Egyptians and Arabs will not address [...] "Salam" [...] to an infidel; the Moslems of India have no such objection. This, {{on the banks of the}} Nile, is the revival of an old prejudice. Alexander of Alexandria, in his circular letter, describes the Arian heretics as [...] "men whom it is not lawful to salute, or to bid God-speed." [...] [FN#5] It is Prince Puckler Muskau, if I recollect rightly, who mentions that in his case a pair of dark spectacles produced a marked difference of apparent temperature, whilst travelling over the sultry sand of the Desert. I have often remarked the same phenomenon. The Arabs, doubtless for some reason of the kind, always draw their head-kerchiefs, like hoods, far over their brows, and cover up their mouths, even when the sun and wind are behind them. Inhabitants of the Desert are to be recognised by the net-work of wrinkles traced in the skin round the orbits, the result of half-closing their eyelids; but this is done to temper the intensity of the light. [FN#6] Their own pipe-tubes were of coarse wood, in shape somewhat resembling the German porcelain pipe. The bowl was of soft stone, apparently steatite, which, when fresh, is easily fashioned with a knife. In Arabia the Badawin, and even the townspeople, use on journeys an earthen tube from five to six inches shorter than the English [...] "clay," [...] thicker in the tube, with a <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> coloured yellowish-red. It contains a handful of tobacco, and the smoker emits puffs like a chimney. In some of these articles the bowl forms a rectangle with the tube; in others, the whole is an unbroken curve, like the old Turkish Meerschaum. [FN#7] See Wallin's papers, published in the Journals of the Royal Geographical Society. [FN#8] Shurum, (plural of Sharm, a creek), a word prefixed to the proper names of three small ports in the Sinaitic peninsula. [FN#9] Tawarah, plural of Turi, an inhabitant of Tur or Sinai. [FN#10] This feature did not escape the practised eye of Denon. [...] "Eyes long, almond-shaped, half shut, and languishing, and turned up at the outer corner, as if habitually fatigued by the light and heat of the sun; cheeks round, &c.," [...] (Voyage en Egypt). The learned Frenchman's description of the ancient Egyptians applies in most points to the Turi Badawin. [FN#11] [...] "And he" [...] (Ishmael) [...] "dwelt in the wilderness of Paran," [...] (Wady Firan?) [...] "and his mother took him a wife, out of the land of Egypt," [...] (Gen. xxi. 21). I wonder that some geographers have attempted to identify Massa, the son of Ishmael, (Gen. xxv. 14), with Meccah, when in verse 18 of the same chapter we read, [...] "And they" [...] (the twelve princes, sons of Ishmael) [...] "dwelt from Havilah unto Shur." [...] This asserts, as clearly as language can, that the posterity of, or the race typified by, Ishmael,-the Syro-Egyptian,-occupied only the northern parts of the peninsula. Their habitat is not even included in Arabia by those writers who bound the country on the north by an imaginary line drawn from Ras Mohammed to the mouths of the Euphrates. The late Dr. J. Wilson ("Lands of the Bible"), repeated by Eliot Warburton ("Crescent and Cross"), lays stress upon the Tawarah tradition, that they are Benu Isra'il converted to Al-Islam, considering it a fulfilment of the prophecy, [...] "that a remnant of Israel shall dwell in Edom." [...] With due deference to so illustrious an Orientalist and Biblical scholar as was Dr. Wilson, I believe that most modern Moslems, being ignorant that Jacob was the first called [...] "prince with God," [...] apply the term Benu-Isra'il to all the posterity of Abraham, not to Jews only. [FN#12] In 1879 the Gates of Suez are a thing of the past; and it is not easy to find where they formerly stood. [FN#13] In the mouth of a Turk, no epithet is more contemptuous than that of [...] "Fellah ibn Fellah,"-"boor, son of a boor!" [...] The Osmanlis have, as usual, a semi-religious tradition to account for the superiority of their nation over the Egyptians. When the learned doctor, Abu Abdullah Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafe'i, returned from Meccah to the banks of the Nile, he mounted, it is said, a donkey belonging to one of the Asinarii of Bulak. Arriving at the Caravanserai, he gave the man ample fare, whereupon the Egyptian, putting forth his hand, and saying, [...] "hat" [...] (give!) called for more. The doctor doubled the fee; still the double was demanded. At last the divine's purse was exhausted, and the proprietor of the donkey waxed insolent. A wandering Turk seeing this, took all the money from the Egyptian, paid him his due, solemnly kicked him, and returned the rest to Al-Shafe'i, who asked him his name-"Osman"-and his nation-the [...] "Osmanli,"-blessed him, and prophesied to his countrymen supremacy over the Fellahs and donkey boys of Egypt. [FN#14] From Samm, the poison-wind. Vulgar and most erroneously called the Simoon. [FN#15] Hugh Murray derives this word from the Egyptian, and quoting Strabo and Abulfeda makes it synonymous with Auasis and Hyasis. I believe it to be a mere corruption of the Arabic Wady [Arabic text] or Wah. Nothing can be more incorrect than the vulgar idea of an Arabian Oasis, except it be the popular conception of an Arabian Desert. One reads of [...] "isles of the sandy sea," [...] but one never sees them. The real [...] "Wady" [...] is, generally speaking, a rocky valley bisected by the bed of a mountain torrent, dry during the hot season. In such places the Badawin love to encamp, because they find food and drink,-water being always procurable by digging. When the supply is perennial, the Wady becomes the site of a village. The Desert is as unaptly compared to a [...] "sandy sea." [...] Most of the wilds of Arabia resemble the tract between Suez and Cairo; only the former are of primary formation, whereas the others are of a later date. Sand-heaps are found in every Desert, but sand-plains are a local feature, not the general face of the country. The Wilderness, east of the Nile, is mostly a hard dry earth, which requires only a monsoon to become highly productive: even where silicious sand covers the plain, the waters of a torrent, depositing humus or vegetable mould, bind the particles together, and fit it for the reception of seed. [FN#16] The intelligent reader will easily understand that I am speaking of the Desert in the temperate season, not during the summer heats, when the whole is one vast furnace, nor in winter, when the Sarsar wind cuts like an Italian Tramontana. [FN#17] This, as a general rule in Al-Islam, is a sign that the Maghrib or evening prayer must not be delayed. The Shafe'i school performs its devotions immediately after the sun has disappeared. [FN#18] This salutation of peace is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observing traveller will easily make of it a shibboleth. [FN#19] To [...] "nakh" [...] in vulgar, as in classical, Arabic is to gurgle [...] "Ikh! ikh!" [...] in the bottom of one's throat till the camel kneels down. We have no English word for this proceeding; but Anglo-Oriental travellers are rapidly naturalising the [...] "nakh." ...|$|E

5000|$|The meat-based raw {{materials}} used in the pudding are sourced from the producers who farm within a six-mile (10 km) radius of the factory at Timoleague whereas {{most of the other}} ingredients used (cereals, onions, casings) are sourced outside the immediate area. One of the cardinal features of this pudding is the cereal is soaked in fresh pig's blood the night before preparation of the pudding. The following morning, the remaining ingredients are minced together in a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> blended into the blood mixture before being placed in the casings. Once filled, the puddings are boiled in water for 15 minutes. After boiling, the puddings are taken out and left to cool. [...] The pudding is brown in colour, is a long cylindrical sausage shape which forms naturally into rings and is made from fresh pigs' blood, pork trimming, cereal, fresh onions, seasonings, spices and natural casings. It comes in weights of between 750 and 1000 grams (1.7-2.2 lb). Due to the inclusion of fresh blood, the taste of the pudding can be described as very clean and rustic. The process of pre-soaking pig's blood in oatmeal is a continuation of the traditional west Cork method of combining blood and cereal in a pudding to give it its distinctive regional texture and taste.|$|E

50|$|A consommé is made {{by adding}} a mixture of ground meats, {{together}} with mirepoix (a combination of carrots, celery, and onion), tomatoes, and egg whites into either bouillon or stock. The key to making a high quality consommé is simmering; the act of simmering, combined with frequent stirring, brings impurities {{to the surface of}} the liquid, which are further drawn out due to the presence of acid from the tomatoes. Eventually, the solids begin to congeal at the surface of the liquid, forming a 'raft', which is caused by the proteins in the egg whites. Once the 'raft' begins to form, the heat is reduced, and the consommé is simmered at a lower heat until it reaches the desired flavor, which usually takes anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour. The resulting concoction is a clear liquid that has either a rich amber colour (for beef or veal consommé) or a very pale yellow colour (for poultry consommé). It is then carefully drawn from the pot and passed again through a filter to ensure its purity, and is then put through a lengthy process where all of the visible fat is skimmed from the surface. To ensure total purification, the consommé can be refrigerated, which draws out remaining fat, which can easily be skimmed off with a cheesecloth. Alternatively, the consommé can be placed in a wide, shallow container such as a sauté pan or <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> wide strips of parchment paper can be dragged along the surface; the tiny amounts of remaining fat adhere to the parchment, leaving the consommé perfectly de-greased. Cartilage and tendons should be left on the meat because of the gelatin they contain, which enhances the mouthfeel of the soup. If beef or veal is used, shin meat is ideal because it is very low in fat and very high in gristle, and although it is undesirable for most other purposes, it is near essential for the flavour of the consommé. The meat is best if it is ground very fine, as if for a mousseline.|$|E

40|$|Economists {{have devoted}} {{considerable}} attention to rent-dissipation in limited-entry fisheries {{as a result}} of excessive use of capital inputs, or "capital stuffing. " We may refer to this mechanism of rent dissipation as "cost-driven rent dissipation. " An alternative potential mechanism of rent dissipation, which we refer to as "value-driven rent dissipation," may occur if limited-entry management causes fishermen to receive a lower price for their fish than would be possible under an alternative management system. In theory, value-driven rent dissipation may occur if the marginal value to a fisherman from fishing differently (for example, more slowly to take better care of the fish and improve quality) is positive but less than the marginal cost from a reduced catch share. This paper describes an economic experiment to study value-driven rent dissipation in a limited entry fishery. Following an approach developed by Knapp and Murphy (2010), subjects "fish" competitively for beans by scooping them out of a <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> "delivering" them to a pitcher. Given the choice of delivering to a pitcher placed close by for a lower price or a pitcher placed farther away for a higher price, unless the price differential is sufficiently high, subjects choose the closer but lower-priced pitcher. With the introduction of an individual quota to replace the competitive fishery, value dissipation ends as subjects choose the higher-priced pitcher. This simple experiment provides a powerful demonstration of a less-appreciated mechanism of rent dissipation, which is useful for both research and teaching...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Therapeutic Value of Radiofrequency Ablation of Hepatic Malignant Tumors Patients {{with primary}} and {{secondary}} malignancies of the liver are common. Liver is involved in 40 % of adult patients who have primary tumors extrahepatic, and in cases with primary tumors, drained by the portal venous system (pancreas, <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> stomach), liver is involved {{in as much as}} 75 % of patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the most common primary liver tumor, and metastatic liver tumours most often generate from colorectal carcinoma. Without treatment the median survival of HCC is 4 to 20 months and for CRM it is 5 to 13 months. Surgical resection of hepatic tumours is the best treatment modality with potential for cure in selected patients. According to a recent report from March 2006, the overall survival after hepatic resection of colorectal metastases at 1, 5, and 10 years was 93 %, 47 %, and 28 %, respectively. In fact, only 5 % to 15 % of newly diagnosed primary or secondary liver malignancies are amenable to surgical resection. Use of other methods which do not involve resection has been in focus and can be divided into systematic techniques such as chemotherapy and arterial infusion chemotherapy and direct ablation treatments such as cryotherapy, ethanol injection and thermal ablation by use of lasers, microwaves or radiofrequency. RFA involves the localized application of alternating current that creates a marked agitation of ions in the target tissue. Agitation results in frictional heat around the electrode and thermal coagulative necrosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the treatment efficacy of RFA and associated complications, based on available literature. The included studies were heterogeneous and clear conclusions were difficult to draw. The best overall survival for RFA treatment according to the included studies was 93 % for 1 -year, 69 % for 2 -years, and 63 % for 3 -years. Major complications ranged from 0. 9 % to 19. 8 % and minor from 4. 7 % to 32. 5 %. At present the radiofrequency ablation seems to be a promising therapy, but these results are based on the uncontrolled non-randomised trials. Randomised trials are not available to support the use of this technique. After search in Cochrane database only one review was present and this too compared different treatment modalities for the treatment of HCC. Therefore conclusive evidence based on randomised trials for potential survival benefit from RFA of hepatic tumors is awaited...|$|E
