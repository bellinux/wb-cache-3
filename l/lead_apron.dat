50|$|A <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> or leaded apron {{is a type}} of {{protective}} clothing that acts as a radiation shield. It is constructed of a thin rubber exterior and an interior of lead {{in the shape of a}} hospital apron. The purpose of the <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> is to reduce exposure of a hospital patient to x-rays to vital organs that are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation during medical imaging that uses x-rays (radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography).|$|E

40|$|Medical {{radiation}} practitioners {{have been}} using <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> to protect themselves and others from uncontrolled X-ray radiation for almost a century. <b>Lead</b> impregnated vinyl <b>aprons</b> have excellent radiation shielding abilities. However, their shielding, comfort and design abilities overtime have been put to question by numerous studies. Defects including holes, tears and cracks in <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> have been proven to reduce the shielding ability and increase radiation exposure. <b>Lead</b> <b>aprons</b> are also associated with comfort issues that border around their weight and fitness. The use of <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> is associated with increased prevalence rate of orthopaedic problems among interventional radiologists because of its additional weight. On the other hand, a multi-layered apron increases heat insulation and thermal discomfort. In addition, <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> can pick up dirt and get contaminated with germs which cause infections. One design of <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> for all male and female practitioners does not fit different body shapes effectively. There {{is a need to}} redesign the <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> as protective clothing to allow ease movements for radiographers while performing their tasks...|$|R

40|$|At present, interventional {{radiology}} (IVR) tends to involve long procedures (long radiation duration), and physicians are {{near to the}} source of scattered radiation. Hence, shielding is critical in protecting physicians from radiation. Protective aprons and additional lead-shielding devices, such as tableside lead drapes, are important means of protecting the physician from scat-tered radiation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether non-lead aprons are effective in protecting physicians from radiation during IVR procedures. In this study, the radiation protection effects of commercially available protective <b>lead</b> and non-lead <b>aprons,</b> when exposed to diagnostic X rays, are compared. The performance of these non-lead and <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> was similar for scattered X rays at tube voltages of 60 – 120 kV. Properly designed non-lead aprons are thus more suitable for phys-icians because they weigh 20 % less than the <b>lead</b> <b>aprons,</b> and are non-toxic...|$|R

5000|$|Demron is a radiation-shielding fabric. Weight-for-weight the {{material}} has slightly lower radiation protection than lead shielding, however being flexible. It is essentially particles of metal {{embedded in a}} polyethylene-based material. The manufacturer claims it's a [...] "liquid metal". It is roughly {{three to four times}} more expensive than a conventional <b>lead</b> <b>apron,</b> but can be treated like a normal fabric for cleaning, storage and disposal. [...] More recent uses for Demron include certified first responder hazmat suits as well as tactical vests.|$|E
50|$|The dosage of X-ray {{radiation}} {{received by}} a dental patient is typically small (around 0.150 mSv {{for a full}} mouth series, according to the American Dental Association website), equivalent to a few days' worth of background environmental radiation exposure, or similar to the dose received during a cross-country airplane flight (concentrated into one short burst aimed at a small area). Incidental exposure is further reduced {{by the use of}} a lead shield, <b>lead</b> <b>apron,</b> sometimes with a lead thyroid collar. Technician exposure is reduced by stepping out of the room, or behind adequate shielding material, when the X-ray source is activated.|$|E
40|$|X-rays are {{a useful}} {{diagnostic}} {{tool in the}} radiology world. Despite their usefulness, overexposure to radiation affects the health {{of those who are}} working closely with X-ray scanning equipment. Overexposure to high levels of radiation can cause large number of cells in the human body to die or to lose their ability to replicate. This damage can ultimately lead to organ failure. Currently <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> are the only primary protective garment used by radiation workers in hospitals and clinics to shield them from radiation. However, the commercial <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> currently available in the healthcare market have many problems; for example, causing user back pain due to the weight of the apron. These inflexible aprons can crack, compromising the user’s protection from radiation leakage, and the disposal of these aprons can pollute the environment due to the toxicity of <b>lead.</b> Also, commercial <b>aprons</b> at present are only available as a universal design for both males and females, and therefore are not designed to fit the female anatomical structure. This research aimed at developing a durable, safer and lighter textile substrate and garment structure that improves shielding and structural integrity. In this thesis, the comfort properties of <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> have been evaluated to establish a baseline for future assessment of new designs. The thermal resistance of commercial <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> is shown to be high, potentially affecting the heat stress of the wearer. A new method was developed to measure the pressure distribution of <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> as part of understanding the comfort performance of protective clothing. A range of textile fabrics that could be used as alternative casing for <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> were investigated with a view to enhancing the comfort properties of existing commercial products. Prototype aprons were developed to accommodate the different body shape of female radiographers with enhanced comfort properties. The prototype aprons will be used as a backing base for coating with non-lead-based X-ray absorbing substances that have the same shielding efficiency as the lead standard, but are safer for the environment and lighter in weight. Experimental results of fabric coating showed that microparticles of size less than 10 μm and resin can be homogeneously spread on the coating side of the fabric surface. When the coating is {{on one side of the}} garment and primarily on the surface of the fabric, the uncoated fabric side can be exposed as the surface of an apron. This may save half the weight of casing material for an apron. Different methodologies and woven and knitted textile substrates were used to develop coated materials with novel X-ray attenuating substances. This thesis found that the X-ray attenuating substance atomic number, density, mass attenuation coefficient, linear attenuation coefficient, atomic cross-section and other important factors can affect the attenuation strength and should be considered when designing X-ray shielding garments. As a result, the selection of radiation-absorber substances must be made carefully to combine all these properties. Bismuth oxide was one of the best selections and achieved the best result for shielding from X-rays. Novel prototype aprons were developed based on evaluation of the benchmark <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> in terms of comfort performance. The selected textile materials have reasonable flexibility and good overall moisture management properties through use of a wool yarn plated with nylon. Different designs were created to suit the needs of various female bodies, such as radiographers, pregnant women and female patients who are undergoing mammography. All the prototype aprons have been assessed for comfort properties such as fit and air gap size, thermal comfort, stiffness and durability. It was found that the prototype aprons show enhanced comfort performance compared to the benchmark...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite the firmly {{established}} occupational risk {{of exposure to}} X-rays, they are used extensively in spine surgeries. Shielding by <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> {{is the most common}} protective practice. We quantified the level of their radiation blocking ability in a real-life setting. Methods: Single-center, prospective, randomized study of adult patients with degenerative lumbar disorders, scheduled to undergo posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Instrumentation was performed in either a robot-assisted, minimally invasive approach (RO) or a conventional, fluoroscopically-assisted, open approach (FA). Outcome measures included the quantitative measurement of the surgeon’s actual exposure to radiation, as recorded by thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLD) worn both above and under the 0. 5 mm thyroid and trunk lead protectors. Findings: Sixty four patients were included in this study, 34 in the RO cohort and 30 in the FA cohort. The radiation blocked by the aprons, represented as the ratio of the under-apron to above-apron TLDs, averaged 37. 1 % (range 25. 4 – 48. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval between 30. 6 – 43. 6 %). In the RO cohort, the average per-screw radiation dose and time were 51. 9 % and 73. 7 % lower, respectively, than the per screw exposure in the FA cohort. Interpretation: The 0. 5 mm <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> blocked just over one third of the radiation scattered towards the surgeon. Use of robotic-guidance in a minimally invasive approach provided for a reduction of 62. 5 % of the overall radiation the surgeon was exposed to during open conventional approach. We conclude that reduced radiation use (e. g. by using robotic guidance) is a more effective strategy for minimizing exposure to radiation than reliance on protection by <b>lead</b> <b>aprons,</b> and recommend utilization of practices and technologies that reduce the surgical team’s routine exposure to X-rays...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{investigate}} the factors that reduce fetal dose in pregnant patients with breast cancer throughout their radiation treatment. Two main factors in a standard radiation oncology center are considered as the treatment planning systems (TPSs) and simple shielding for intensity modulated radiation therapy technique. Materials and Methods: TPS factor was evaluated with two different planning algorithms: Anisotropic analytical algorithm and Acuros XB (external beam). To evaluate the shielding factor, a standard radiological purpose <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> was chosen. For both studies, thermoluminescence dosimeters were {{used to measure the}} point dose, and an Alderson RANDO-phantom was used to simulate a female pregnant patient in this study. Thirteen measurement points were chosen in the 32 nd slice of the phantom to cover all possible locations of a fetus up to 8 th week of gestation. Results: The results show that both of the TPS algorithms are incapable of calculating the fetal doses, therefore, unable to reduce them at the planning stage. Shielding with a standard <b>lead</b> <b>apron,</b> however, showed a slight radiation protection (about 4. 7 %) to the fetus decreasing the mean fetal dose from 84. 8 mGy to 80. 8 mGy, which cannot be disregarded in case of fetal irradiation. Conclusions: Using a <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> for shielding the abdominal region of a pregnant patient during breast irradiation showed a minor advantage; however, its possible side effects (i. e., increased scattered radiation and skin dose) should also be investigated further to solidify its benefits...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{diagnostic}} radiology <b>lead</b> <b>apron,</b> are usually {{used to protect}} patients and radiology staff against ionizing radiation. <b>Lead</b> <b>apron</b> is a desirable shield due to high absorption and effective attenuation of x-ray photons in the {{diagnostic radiology}} range. Objective: Although lead aprons have good radiation protection properties, in recent years, researchers {{have been looking for}} alternative materials to be used instead of <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> because of some problems derived from lead-content of aprons. Because of its lead-content, these radiation protection garments are so heavy and uncomfortable for the staff to wear, particularly in long-time uses. In addition, lead is a toxic element and its disposal is associated with environmental and human-health hazards. Method: In this study, several new combinations of lead free materials ((W-Si), (W-Sn-Ba-EPVC), (W-Sn-Cd-EPVC)) have been investigated in the energy range of diagnostic radiology in two geometries: narrow and broad beam. Geometries of the radiation attenuation characteristics of these materials was assessed in 40, 60, 90 and 120 kVp and the results compared with those of some lead-containing materials ((Pb-Si), (Pb-EPVC)). Results: Lead shields still provide better protection in low energies (below 40 kVp). Combination of W-Sn-Cd-EPVC has shown the best radiation attenuation features in 60 and 90 kVp and the composition of (W-Sn-Ba-EPVC) represents the best attenuation in 120 kVp, even better than previously mentioned lead- containing composites. Conclusion: Lead free shields are completely effective for protection against X-ray energies in the range of 60 to 120 kVp...|$|E
40|$|Concern among patients, often {{prompted}} by medical practitioners, regarding {{the harmful effects}} of radiation caused by dental x-ray procedures, has caused several patients of the dental school of the University of Pretoria to refuse dental radiographic procedures. Buch and Fensham in a previous article demonstrated that radiation doses to the eyes and thyroid resulting from a single pantomogram constituted less than 10 % of that which would be imparted by a transatlantic flight in terms of added natural background radiation. The authors in this study investigated doses to the same organs resulting from a full-mouth periapical series first using films and then digital imaging. Doses to the uterus resulting from these same examinations as well as from a pantomogram were also determined both with and without the use of a <b>lead</b> <b>apron.</b> Doses to the eye from a full-mouth examination using film compared favourably with those for a panoramic examination, but were much reduced when digital imaging techniques were employed. Doses to the uterus were small (equivalent to half a day of background radiation) for both a full-mouth examination using digital imaging, as well as for a pantomogram. However, from the results it would appear that there is little difference in the dose of scatter radiation to the uterus from a full-mouth examination whether or not a <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> is used.

40|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>aprons</b> are {{typically}} worn by radiographers {{to protect them}} from harmful radiation. As such, a good radiation shield must have a high Lead Equivalence to minimize the transmitted radiation dose during exposure. While most radiation shields fulfil this requirement by using matrices of lead and other substances, most aprons are uncomfortable to wear. Further, if the examination takes longer than expected, the radiographer will feel discomfort because of the heavy weight of the apron, or the smooth surface of the coated casing material. Another issue is the poor fit and design of the aprons due to the stiffness of the lead sheet. In general, the comfort characteristics of any textile material are related to air permeability, moisture management, abrasion resistance, fabric structure, thickness and weight, as well as yarn types. The objective {{of this study is to}} use standard testing methods to characterize some selected fabrics in terms of their X-ray shielding ability, physical, mechanical, and morphologic properties.

40|$|Few {{practical}} evaluation {{studies have}} been conducted on X-ray protective aprons in workplaces. We examined the effects of exchanging the protective apron type with regard to exposure reduction in experimental and practical fields, and discuss the effectiveness of X-ray protective aprons. Experimental field evaluations were performed by the measurement of the X-ray transmission rates of protective aprons. Practical field evaluations were performed by the estimation of the differences in the transit doses before and after the apron exchange. A 0. 50 -mm lead-equivalent-thick non-lead apron had the lowest transmission rate among the 7 protective aprons, but weighed 10. 9 kg and was too heavy. The 0. 25 and 0. 35 -mm lead-equivalent-thick non-lead aprons differed little in the practical field of interventional radiology. The 0. 35 -mm <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> had lower X-ray transmission rates and transit doses than the 0. 25 -mm lead-equivalent- thick non-lead apron, and each of these differences exceeded 8 % in the experimental field and approximately 0. 15 mSv/month in the practical field of computed tomography (p < 0. 01). Therefore, we concluded that the 0. 25 -mm lead-equivalent-thick aprons and 0. 35 -mm <b>lead</b> <b>apron</b> are effective for interventional radiology operators and computed tomography nurses, respectively. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a typical}} graded-Z shield, the high-Z layer {{effectively}} scatters protons and electrons. It also absorbs gamma rays, which produces X-ray fluorescence. Each subsequent layer absorbs the X-ray fluorescence {{of the previous}} material, eventually reducing the energy to a suitable level. Each decrease in energy produces bremsstrahlung and Auger electrons, which are below the detectors energy threshold. Some designs also include an outer layer of aluminium, which may simply be {{the skin of the}} satellite.The effectiveness of a material as a biological shield is related to its cross-section for scattering and absorption, and to a first approximation is proportional to the total mass of material per unit area interposed along the line of sight between the radiation source and the region to be protected. Hence, shielding strength or [...] "thickness" [...] is conventionally measured in units of g/cm2. The radiation that manages to get through falls exponentially with the thickness of the shield. In x-ray facilities, walls surrounding the room with the x-ray generator may contain lead sheets, or the plaster may contain barium sulfate. Operators view the target through a leaded glass screen, or if they must remain in the same room as the target, wear <b>lead</b> <b>aprons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{analytic}} cell {{was mainly}} used for process control {{analysis of the}} reprocessing process and for the measurement of fuel burn up ratio in JAERI's Reprocessing Test Facility (JRTF). The analytic cell was a heavy shielded one and equipped with a conveyor. The cell was alpha and beta(gamma) contaminated. For dismantling of analytic cells, {{it is very important}} to establish a method to remove the heavy shield safely and reduce the exposure. At first, a green house was set up to prevent the spread out of contamination, and next, the analytic cell was dismantled. Depending on the contamination condition, the workers wore protective suits such as air ventilated-suits for prevention of internal exposure and vinyl chloride <b>aprons,</b> <b>lead</b> <b>aprons</b> in order to reduce external exposure. From the work carried out, various data such as needed manpower for the activities, the collective dose of workers by external exposure, the amount of radioactive wastes and the relation between the weight of the shield and its dismantling efficiency were obtained and input for the database. The method of dismantling and the experience with the dismantling of the analytic cell in the JRTF, carried out during 2001 and 2002, are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>aprons</b> {{are widely}} used in medical imaging to protect radiographers and {{patients}} from harmful radiation. However, lead is not a desirable material for use in wearable radiation protection due to its heavy weight, inflexibility, poor durability, and toxicity. In this study, we explored the suitability of bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3) coating for textiles {{as an alternative to}} lead. The intention was to demonstrate the concept and technology that will achieve a lead-equivalent lightweight X-ray protective textile material with improved wearability. The primary objective was to evaluate the X-ray shielding efficiency of two textile materials coated with Bi 2 O 3. To do so, X-ray exposures were made at the system setting of 80 kVp, 12 mAs, and 80 SID (the distance from the X-ray beam source to the specimen). It is evident from this study that Bi 2 O 3 in a suitable resin matrix can be coated on fabrics and is an effective method to produce flexible, wearable, and lead-free aprons. Coated polyester fabrics with over 50 % Bi 2 O 3 showed enhanced shielding ability for transmitted X-rays. This research has shown that microparticle size Bi 2 O 3 can be effective for X-ray attenuation...|$|R
