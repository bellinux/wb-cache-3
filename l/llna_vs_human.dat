50|$|Snails is a {{shooting}} game by PDAmill for Windows Mobile. There {{was also a}} version for Palm OS, now discontinued, and alpha/beta versions for Symbian and Microsoft Windows, which have not been updated in over a year. In the game, you play as a race of snails (Moogums, Lupeez, or Nooginz) planning world conquest (of the planet Schnoogie) in either Missions or Deathmatch modes. In Missions mode, players complete levels to unlock new weapons and the final mission. In Deathmatch mode, players simply fight and kill enemy snails. There are four Deathmatch modes: <b>Human</b> <b>vs.</b> CPU, CPU <b>vs.</b> CPU, <b>Human</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Human,</b> and <b>Human</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Human</b> (network play). The game features many destructive weapons, including teargas, which is deadly because the salt from a snail's tears dry out its body.|$|R
40|$|For the 22 {{formulations}} {{that had}} associated GP {{data for the}} formulation itself, 14 % (3 / 22) were classified as sensitizers and 86 % (19 / 22) as non-sensitizers according to the GP results (Figure E- 1). These results {{are based on a}} positive overall GP call for formulation EXP 10810 1. The LLNA classified 59 % (13 / 22) of the formulations as sensitizers and 41 % (9 / 22) as non-sensitizers (Figure E- 1). All three of the pesticide formulations identified as sensitizers in the GP test were also identified as sensitizers in the LLNA. The LLNA also identified an additional six substances as sensitizers that were classified as non-sensitizers in the GP test (Table E- 1). There were no comparative human data with which to determine the actual human sensitization potential. 1. 2 Testing of Pesticide Formulations: <b>LLNA</b> <b>vs.</b> GP with Any Available Reference Data for Relevant Substances Of the 70 formulations, 69 % (48 / 70) were classified as sensitizers and 31 % (22 / 70) as nonsensitizers on the basis of various types of GP data (Figure E- 1). To assign these classifications, a most conservative approach was used; i. e., if a GP result for the formulation, any active ingredient, a substance related to an active ingredient, or a relate...|$|R
