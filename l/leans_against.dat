5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E
25|$|A little chapel, {{dedicated}} to Saint Michael, <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall of}} the more recent south-facing section; built around 1600, {{it is one of the}} few buildings erected in the castles of Bellinzona under the rule of the three Swiss cantons.|$|E

The left palm leans on the left knee.|$|E

25|$|Bugs Bunny's nonchalant carrot-chewing {{standing}} position, {{as explained}} by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Bob Clampett, originated {{in a scene}} in the film It Happened One Night, in which Clark Gable's character <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to Claudette Colbert's character. This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as satire.|$|E
25|$|In the {{background}} of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to Jacob's Ladder, <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> the back wall, and a dove which represents the Holy Spirit rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the Holy Trinity. Millais likely used Albrecht Dürer's print Melancholia I as a source for this imagery, along with quattrocento works. The sheep in the sheepfold seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{features a}} full-length bronze figure depicting {{a mother and}} three children. The woman wears traditional pioneer clothing, including a long dress, shawl, and shoes. She stands, facing forward, and holds a flintlock rifle in her proper right hand. The woman's opposite hand rests {{on the head of}} the taller of two girls at her proper left side. The taller girl holds the shorter one with her proper left hand, while the shorter girl faces the taller one and rests against the mother's proper left knee. A young boy clings to the mother's dress and <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> her rifle. The sculpture measures approximately [...] × [...] × [...] and rests on a concrete and granite base that measures approximately [...] × [...] × [...]|$|E

500|$|When {{production}} of [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] ended, Parker and Stone were {{dissatisfied with the}} final product and believed audiences would hate it, but were surprised to receive largely positive feedback from fans, some of whom described it as their favorite of {{the latter half of}} the season. [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] has been described as one of the classic episodes of South Park. In 2003, the Chicago Tribune listed it among the top 10 episodes of the series. Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune praised the episode and said it [...] "celebrates Valentine's Day [...] only the Comedy Central series can", although he warned it was not for children. During a brief scene in [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty", Mr. Garrison <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a mailbox with a United States Postal Service logo printed on the side. The Postal Service contacted Comedy Central after the episode aired and threatened legal action if the logo was used again without permission.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E
2500|$|Among later artistic commemorations is William Dyce's oil {{painting}} of [...] "George Herbert at Bemerton" [...] (1860) in the Guildhall Art Gallery. The poet is pictured in his riverside garden, prayer book in hand. Over the meadows is Salisbury Cathedral, where {{he used to}} join in the musical evensong; his lute <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a stone bench and against a tree a fishing rod is propped, a reminder of his first biographer, Isaac Walton. There is also a musical reference in Charles West Cope's [...] "George Herbert and his mother" [...] (1872) in Gallery Oldham. The mother points a poem out to him with an arm twined round his neck in a room that has a virginal in the background.|$|E

2500|$|In Pressing Grapes (1880), {{two young}} women, their skirts {{gathered}} to their knees, {{stand in a}} stone tub, pressing grapes, as the juice pours into a bucket through a notch {{in the side of}} the tub. [...] The two women stand on either side of a pole suspended from above, which they grasp with their hands to keep their balance. [...] Behind them are arches, through which a richly-forested landscape can be seen below and stretching into the distance. [...] Stone jars and baskets of grapes line the wall. [...] A young girl with a ribbon in her hair <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a large vessel, her feet on a stool as she watches the women work. [...] The painting was discovered at a home in Portland, Maine in 1997, and subsequently determined to be the work of Weguelin. [...] This may be the same painting as The Vintage.|$|E
2500|$|... "The 34-Ton Bat"-named for the enormous, 120-foot-tall bat that <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> the Louisville Slugger Museum in Louisville, Ky.-is full of bits of {{information}} that will give even the most knowledgeable fan {{a new understanding of}} the game and of those who have played it. 'Material culture' is the academic term for the study of physical objects as a means of getting at larger truths and understanding historical turning points. It is exactly what anthropologists and archaeologists have long done, as they coax conclusions from shards of pottery and projectile points. In recent years, popular authors have taken a page from this playbook and given us, among other titles, Neil MacGregor's [...] "A History of the World in 100 Objects," [...] Harold Holzer's [...] "The Civil War in 50 Objects" [...] and Tom Standage's [...] "A History of the World in 6 Glasses." [...] Now veteran Sports Illustrated writer and columnist Steve Rushin has applied this notion to baseball by rummaging through the attic of the national pastime and telling its story through objects as central as the bat and ball and even humbler elements-including the primitive steel cups fashioned to protect the [...] "family jewels" [...] and ballpark urinals, a necessity made all the more urgent because of the oceans of beer consumed at ballparks." ...|$|E
