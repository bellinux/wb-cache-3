40|$|The rigorosum {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on {{the responsibility of}} an employee for damages caused to the employer. The work firstly describes {{the problem of the}} law responsibility in general and then responsibility for the damage. The main part of this work is shaped by the description of individual kinds of the responsibility of an employee for the loss and by the question of the extend of compensation. Attention is also paid to the prevention of the damage, labour law of the European Union and the options of the employee to insure against <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> any <b>material</b> <b>damage</b> caused to the employer...|$|R

40|$|Two {{models of}} victim compensation: through civil {{litigation}} and through administrative public funds are explored {{in this article}} in order to compare their effectiveness. Two legislations are compared: Serbian and Israel. A special legal basis for compensation from the State is foreseen in Serbian legislation. A natural person may claim compensation for the complete damage caused, in case of death, bodily injury or destruction of property. However, such claims are rarely charged. In Israel, limited amounts are paid from the public funds to victims of hostile actions in case of death, bodily injury or property damage.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{analytical and}} experimental {{efforts to find}} the internal damping and elastic stiffness of E-glass fiber-reinforced epoxy beams under flexural vibration.

Comparison. of measured values of the complex moduli with predicted moduli and with predicted bounds on the moduli shows that, for small amplitudes, the predicted values are reasonably accurate. Damping and stiffness are independent of amplitude as long as the maximum strain amplitude does not exceed the threshold strain <b>for</b> <b>material</b> <b>damage.</b> Once this threshold strain is exceeded, however, permanent changes occur in damping and stiffness. The resulting increase in damping is much more significant than the corresponding reduction in stiffness. SCOP...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{developing}} a theoretical model able to predict the generation of nonlinear elastic effects associated to the interaction of ultrasonic waves with the steady-state nonlinear response of local defect resonance (LDR). The LDR effect is used in nonlinear elastic wave spectroscopy to enhance the excitation of the <b>material</b> <b>damage</b> at its local resonance, thus to dramatically increase the vibrational amplitude of material nonlinear phenomena. The main result of this work is to prove both analytically and experimentally the generation of novel nonlinear elastic wave effects, here named as nonlinear damage resonance intermodulation, which correspond to a nonlinear intermodulation between the driving frequency and the LDR one. Beside this intermodulation effect, other nonlinear elastic wave phenomena such as higher harmonics of the input frequency and superharmonics of LDR frequency were found. The analytical model relies on solving the nonlinear equation of motion governing bending displacement under the assumption of both quadratic and cubic nonlinear defect approximation. Experimental tests on a damaged composite laminate confirmed and validated these predictions and showed that using continuous periodic excitation, the nonlinear structural phenomena associated to LDR could also be featured at locations different from the damage resonance. These findings will provide new opportunities <b>for</b> <b>material</b> <b>damage</b> detection using nonlinear ultrasounds...|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron light {{absorbers}} intercept {{synchrotron radiation}} to protect chamber walls from excessive heat.

These absorbers are designed to last the lifetime of the machine. Any premature cracking {{could result in a}} leak and, consequently, loss of the ultra high vacuum environment. Using secondary and backscattered electron techniques, several sections of a used copper absorber were analyzed <b>for</b> <b>material</b> <b>damage.</b> Chemical analyses were performed on these samples as well. Comparing the unexposed sections to the sections exposed to the electron beam, few cracks were seen in the copper. However, the exposed samples showed heavy surface damage, in addition to crevices that could eventually result in material failure. Significant corrosion was also evident along the water cooling passage of the samples. These findings suggest that further investigation and periodic inspection of absorbers in SPEAR 3 are necessary to control corrosion of the copper...|$|R
