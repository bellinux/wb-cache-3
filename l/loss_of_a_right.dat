[...] Although Exquemelin does not number the articles, the {{following}} approximately reflects {{his description of the}} buccaneers' laws: I. The fund of all payments under the articles is the stock of what is gotten by the expedition, following the same law as other pirates, that is, No prey, no pay.II. Compensation is provided the Captain for the use of his ship, and the salary of the carpenter, or shipwright, who mended, careened, and rigged the vessel (the latter usually about 150 pieces of eight). A sum for provisions and victuals is specified, usually 200 pieces of eight. A salary and compensation is specified for the surgeon and his medicine chest, usually 250 pieces of eight.III. A standard compensation is provided for maimed and mutilated buccaneers.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the ideas of the Neapolitan enlightenment philosopher Francesco Mario Pagano (1748 - 1799) on criminal law. Pagano was in many ways a culmination of 18 th century penal philosophy. He argued that one ought to make a science out of criminal law. The 18 th century saw major shifts in the way criminal law was perceived. The use of torture was almost universally condemned by the enlightenment philosophers, and some even questioned the legitimacy of capital punishment. Criminal law, most enlightenment philosophers argued, had to be based on principles of utility, necessity, proportionality, and on the rule of law. Criminal law had to follow a set of rules and principles from which it should not deviate. Pagano s penal philosophy is especially influenced by philosophers such as Beccaria (1738 - 1794), Montesquieu (1689 - 1755), Filangieri (1752 - 1788) and Helvétius (1715 - 1771). While all of Pagano s influences were contractarians, meaning that they viewed criminal law {{as the result of a}} social contract, Pagano rejects the contractarian view and argues that criminal laws stem from natural and eternal laws. Another point of interest is that Pagano advocates retributive justice, which most enlightenment philosophers condemned. He argues in favor of retributive justice in a legal sense, meaning the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> for the violation of a right. This thesis seeks to illuminate the relatively unexplored reflections of Pagano on criminal law and to demonstrate how he continues to build on the ideas of his intellectual predecessors...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} of Greppo v Jam-Cal Bundaberg Pty Ltd [2015] QCA 131 illustrates a defect in s 128 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) which gives {{a right to}} a lessee to apply for relief against forfeiture against <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to exercise an option to renew. The defect arises because the legislation does not adequately deal with breaches that occur after the exercise of the option but before the expiry of the lease. Most commercial leases of all kinds have a standard provisions, as the lease in this case, as a conditions of the exercise of the option to renew that the lessee will have given notice of exercise within the time specified to the lessor and will have up to the date of expiry of the lease paid all rent and observed all lessee’s covenants. The difficulties occur because invariably an option must be exercised before the expiry of the lease when a lessee may not be in breach of the lease but may later prior to the expiry of the lease fall into breach. As this decision indicates,at least in Queensland, that the lessee who desires to challenge the lessor’s right to enforce those conditions can neither seek relief under s 128 against forfeiture of the right to exercise the option,or indeed, under s 124 of the Property Law Act 1974 to preserve the agreement for lease brought about by the otherwise regular exercise of the option to renew. The decision cries out for legislative reform along the lines of s 133 E of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) which was amended in 2001 to meet this contingency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how our {{conceptions of}} community and citizenship should be transfigured {{on account of the}} theoretical and ethical concerns revealed by statelessness. Taking my point of departure from the work of Hannah Arendt, I show how the phenomenon of statelessness reveals tensions in our conceptions of political membership and human rights, while highlighting the dilemmas that any approach to democratic inclusion must address. As Arendt’s work emphasizes, one of the greatest challenges to the cosmopolitan ideal of realizing universal human rights {{is the way in which}} realizing rights claims is tied to political membership within a particular community. The crucial loss of a ‘right to have rights’ suffered by the stateless is not one of a ‘natural’ right but rather the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of belonging to a community within which such rights have meaning in the locus of citizenship. The paper then shifts from a diagnostic to a prescriptive focus, turning to Jurgen Habermas’ notion of discourse ethics grounded in his account of communicative action as a means to theorize the issues raised by statelessness and the idea of a claim to community. While discourse ethics offers a useful framework, I argue that we need a supplementary orientation toward openness, given that statelessness has at its core the problem of inclusion. In addressing this more fundamental question of inclusion, I turn to contemporary theorists of agonistic democracy whose focus on the contestability of terms and the fundamentally unsettled nature of the political provide resources for conceptualizing more open notions of political membership. While noting the limitations of each approach, I conclude by showing how discourse ethics and agnostic theory can be used to imagine communities that eschew the exclusions that create statelessness...|$|E

We therefore {{move away from the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dyadic relationship between a singular authority and a singular recipient, be that individual citizens, households or indeed a singular moral community. Instead we uncover overlapping relations, both vertical and horizontal, as different groups make claims and invoke obligations at multiple levels. Second, several actors appear, or are invoked as authorities to be appealed or performed to for satisfaction of rights, from state bodies and individuals to banks, third sector and collective organisations and social movements. Third there is often lack of clarity over how to assert rights or engage with authorities. Two final characteristics are the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> perceived moral <b>right</b> to <b>a</b> secure home and <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> betrayal.

40|$|Anyone who {{has been}} paid {{attention}} to developments {{in the world of}} business over the past quarter century can attest to the fact that intellectual property (IP) is a hot commodity. Indeed, in contrast to the companies that emerged out of the Industrial Revolution, the companies that have spawned as part of the so-called “Information Age” attribute much of their value and future prospects to intangible, rather than tangible, assets. Unfortunately, while bankruptcy courts have generally recognized the need to distinguish between tangible and intangible assets, particularly when determining whether a claim is secured or unsecured, they often fail to acknowledge the practical and legal differences between the various forms of IP. Not all forms of IP are created equal. Trade secrets, in particular, present a challenge for the bankruptcy courts because, by definition, they must be “secret. ” Thus, the very act of identifying and attempting to place a value on trade secrets may result in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> such <b>rights.</b> <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> recent articles have addressed the treatment of IP assets in bankruptcy proceedings. Typically, these articles focus on two important aspects of bankruptcy law as it relates to intellectual property generally: (1) how to perfect a security interest in intellectual property assets, i. e., “general intangibles” in the parlance of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“the U. C. C 2 ̆ 2.), and (2) the treatment of executory contracts involving intellectual property assets. While both of these issues are important, they are meaningless with respect to trade secrets unless the trade secrets continue to exist after the bankruptcy petition is filed. Thus, rather than jump to <b>a</b> discussion <b>of</b> security interests and executory contracts as they relate to trade secrets, this article begins with <b>a</b> discussion <b>of</b> trade secret law and how various trade secret issues may arise in the bankruptcy context.
