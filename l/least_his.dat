25|$|To {{explain these}} facts, historians {{have pointed to}} the {{influence}} of Cantor's former professors, Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Cantor discussed his results with Weierstrass on December 23, 1873. Weierstrass was first amazed by the concept of countability, but then found the countability of the set of real algebraic numbers useful. Cantor did not want to publish yet, but Weierstrass felt that he must publish at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> results concerning the algebraic numbers.|$|E
25|$|But {{like most}} {{leaders in the}} {{nationalist}} scene, not <b>least</b> <b>his</b> successors in the republican scene, he knew little of Ulster or the intensity of Unionist sentiment against home rule. His successor, John Dillon, claimed that Redmond had removed all the obstacles to Irish unity except those of the Ulster unionists. He had persuaded British public and political opinion of all hues of its merits. William O'Brien and his dissident AFIL Party warned in similar vein, that the volatile Northern Ireland situation was left unresolved.|$|E

25|$|The Case of Executing Chen Shimei (鍘美案): Chen Shimei had two {{children}} with wife Qin Xianglian, when he left them behind in his hometown for the Imperial examination in the capital. After placing first, he lied about his marriage and became the emperor’s new brother-in-law. Years later, a famine forced Qin and her children {{to move to the}} capital, where they learned what happened to Chen. Qin finally found a way to meet Chen and begged him to help at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> own children. Not only did Chen refuse, he sent his servant Han Qi to kill them to hide his secret, but Han helped the family escape and killed himself. Desperate, Qin brought her case to Bao Zheng, who tricked Chen to the court to have him arrested. The imperial family intervened with threats, but Bao executed him nonetheless.|$|E

500|$|Memory is also {{important}} in the sections of the novel that deal with the assassins. Each recalls the events {{that led him to}} take part in the assassination of Trujillo. These incidents included the 1956 Galindez kidnapping and murder, the 1960 murder of the Mirabal sisters, and the 1961 split with the Catholic Church. These historical events are used by Vargas Llosa to connect the assassins with specific moments that demonstrate the violence of Trujillo's regime. [...] Trujillo, too, is shown reflecting on the past, not <b>least</b> <b>his</b> own formation and training at the hands of the US Marines.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wete of Complex disagreed, {{calling the}} song, along with [...] "Lemme See", a [...] "gem". Andrew Unterberger of Popdust called the song [...] "not exactly single-worthy material", being [...] "a hobbled-together bunch of musical cliches, where David Guetta stadium house beats meets Skrillex wub-wubs, like {{the brainchild of}} the most uncreative EDM think tank possible." [...] According to Unterberger, the lyrics are [...] "even more hackneyed", with its [...] "Kardashian-worthy opening lines" [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club both [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Scream" [...] as two [...] "overinflated dance numbers" [...] that open the album on a [...] "discouragingly {{perfunctory}} note". He concluded by stating that: [...] "If there’s a bright spot to either, it’s that they forgo the garish auto-tune of Usher's previous dance forays, so at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> whole register comes across cleanly." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1924, Monteux began {{a ten-year}} {{association}} with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, serving as [...] "first conductor" [...] ("eerste dirigent") alongside Willem Mengelberg, its long-serving chief conductor. The two musicians liked and respected one another, despite the difference in their approach to music-making: Monteux was scrupulous in his adherence to a composer's score and straightforward in his performances, while Mengelberg was well known for his virtuoso, sometimes wilful, interpretations and his cavalier attitude to the score ("Ve vill make some changements", as an English player quoted him). Their preferred repertoire overlapped {{in some of the}} classics, but Mengelberg had his own favourites from Bach's St. Matthew Passion to Mahler symphonies, and was happy to leave Debussy and Stravinsky to Monteux. Where their choices coincided, as in Beethoven, Brahms and Richard Strauss, Mengelberg was generous in giving Monteux at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> fair share of them.|$|E
500|$|On-court fights {{had been}} all too common in the 1970s, often {{including}} bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that [...] "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other." [...] Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Shostakovich, {{along with}} many other composers, was again denounced for {{formalism}} in the Zhdanov decree. Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, accused Shostakovich and other composers (such as Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian) of writing inappropriate and formalist music. This was part of an ongoing anti-formalism campaign intended to root out all Western compositional influence as well as any perceived [...] "non-Russian" [...] output. The conference resulted in the publication of the Central Committee’s Decree [...] "On V. Muradeli’s opera The Great Friendship," [...] which was targeted towards all Soviet composers and demanded that they write only [...] "proletarian" [...] music, or music for the masses. The accused composers, including Shostakovich, were summoned to make public apologies in front of the committee. Most of Shostakovich's works were banned, and his family had privileges withdrawn. Yuri Lyubimov says that at this time [...] "he waited for his arrest at night out on the landing by the lift, so that at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> family wouldn't be disturbed." ...|$|E

500|$|... 26 Big Ten student-athletes {{were named}} to the Academic All-District teams {{presented}} by ESPN The Magazine, including 18 first-team selections: Illinois' Jon Asamoah, Indiana's Brandon Bugg, Trea Burgess and Ben Chappell, Michigan's Zoltan Mesko, Michigan State's Blair White, Minnesota's Eric Decker and Jeff Tow-Arnett, Northwestern's Doug Bartels, Stefan Demos and Zeke Markshausen, Penn State's Jeremy Boone, Josh Hull, Andrew Pitz and Stefen Wisniewski, Purdue's Joe Holland and Ryan Kerrigan and Wisconsin's Brad Nortman. The Nittany Lions were one of only six schools nationwide with four or more first-team selections. Second-team picks included the Hawkeyes' Julian Vandervelde, the Wolverines' Jon Conover, the Spartans' Adam Decker and Andrew Hawken and the Buckeyes' Bryant Browning, Todd Denlinger, Andrew Moses and Marcus Williams. To {{be eligible for the}} award, a player must be in at <b>least</b> <b>his</b> second year of athletic eligibility, be a first-team or key performer and carry a cumulative 3.30 grade point average. First-team selections will be added to the national ballot and are eligible for Academic All-America honors to be announced on November 24.

500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very <b>least.</b> <b>His</b> hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E
500|$|The Arizona Fall League {{announced}} on July 20 that Holliday, along with fellow outfielder Carl Crawford, {{were selected to}} their Hall of Fame.
