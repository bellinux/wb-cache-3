5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

30|$|PC 1 {{explaining}} 19.45 % {{of total}} variance has strong loading on pH and PO 4 -P and moderate negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> COD. The positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> pH {{is associated with}} alkaline nature of wastewater, with elevated levels of phosphates mainly from phosphate-based detergents and soaps; thus, PC 1 represents alkaline factor. PC 2 explaining 17.34 % of variance has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> EC, moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> NO 3 -N and strong negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TSS; thus, PC 2 represents salts/ions factor. PC 3 explaining a variance of 15.18 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Ca and moderate negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl, whereas moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> BOD 5. The negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl indicates the source of Ca is other than catchment as Ca is mainly contributed by catchment geology, but its positive association with BOD 5 indicated it is added during the usage of water due the addition of organic matter; thus, PC 3 represents household/water usage factor. PC 4 with a total variance of 14.08 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TDS and K as {{both of them are}} in dissolved state; thus, PC 4 represents dissolved salts factor. PC 5 explaining 12.29 % of total variance has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TP and moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl. Phosphates and chlorides are mainly contributed by soaps and detergents, in addition to catchment, thus PC 5 represents soap/detergent factor. PC 6 with a total variance of 11.94 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Na and moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Mg. Na is contributed by both catchment and household usage of water, but its association with Mg indicates its source as catchment since the Mg is mainly contributed by catchment; thus, PC 6 also represents catchment factor. Thus, overall characteristics of the wastewater are attributed by the household usage along with catchment geology.|$|R

5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|The highway through Keene Valley from Underwood to Keene {{was built}} by 1846. At its {{southern}} end, it connected to a major stagecoach road that connected Albany to the Canadian border.

5|$|A {{spin-off}} titled Summer Days, {{was released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer Days was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross Days {{was released on}} March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and Radish Vacation series. A third spin-off, Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E

5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851.

5|$|In 1823, {{the family}} moved to the village of Georgetown, Ohio, where five more {{siblings}} were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary. At the age of five, young Grant began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later was enrolled in two private schools. In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary, and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin's academy. In his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride, work with, and control horses. Expressing a strong dislike for the tannery, Grant's father instead put this ability to use giving Ulysses work driving wagon <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> supplies and transporting people. Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents. For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination. To others, including late in life, his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic. He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety and quiet nature while adopting his father's Whig political inclinations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant.

The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs.

5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7–8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans Ferry Bridge on the Pennsylvania–New Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move the antique structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will let anyone preserve the bridge by taking it somewhere else. However, there has been no response, and plans for the new bridge were initially scheduled to begin by 2010.|$|E
