It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, Ian, and Barbara {{are still}} missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands on a planet the Doctor {{eventually}} recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors of a space crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when {{the survivors of the}} crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.|$|E

500|$|Howard {{was cast}} in Shyamalan's fantasy thriller The Village (2004) two weeks later without having to audition. Its story is about a [...] "turn-of-the-20th-century" [...] village whose {{residents}} <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of the creatures inhabiting the woods beyond it. She plays the female lead, the chief's blind daughter and love interest to Joaquin Phoenix's part. Her performance was applauded by critics and Howard was nominated for several awards, mostly {{in the category of}} [...] "Best Breakthrough Performance". The Village did well commercially, but had a mixed reception. Following that, Howard was cast by Lars Von Trier to replace Nicole Kidman as Grace Mulligan in Manderlay, the 2005 sequel to Dogville (2003). The director said that it is [...] "quite clear" [...] his movie, set in a plantation, can be seen as an allusion to the Iraq War.|$|E

[...] He argues that Brezhnev was a good politician within the framework of the Soviet political system. [...] Dmitry Peskov said [...] "Brezhnev wasn’t a minus for the history of our country, he was a huge plus, He laid a foundation for the country’s economics and agriculture." [...] Archie Brown wrote in his book, The Rise & Fall of Communism, that [...] "From the point of view of Communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful." [...] Brown adds that the Soviet Union reached [...] "rough parity with the United States" [...] militarily by the early 1970s, and became a superpower in the military sense of the world. According to Brown [...] "The Brezhnev era was a time when tens of millions of Soviet citizens lived a peaceful and predictable life than hitherto" [...] and where [...] "Most people did not <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of the KGB." ...|$|E

So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form.

Quoting that its attack on the Muñiz Air base had been cited as [...] "causing more damage [...] in one day than a month in Vietnam", the EBP urged the masses to mimic the actions of Lares, the attack at Sabana Seca and the FALN attack on Fraunces bar in order to [...] "shake up the government" [...] and [...] "awake the people". In their opinion, this would force a move away from a political environment that [...] "forced [...] to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of losing what little they have", expressing a lack of concern as being [...] "labeled as radicals" [...] and excluded by other pro-independence organizations, summarizing its posture by stating that [...] " [...] never feel excluded due to a la of fear to losing [...] being [...] identity", [...] "not fearing sanctions, persecution, jail or death". Claiming to be ready for a [...] "prolonged struggle" [...] independent of [...] "a desire for adventure" [...] or influenced by [...] "anarchy [...] sectarism", the EBP closed this intervention by requesting the left create an unified thesis that enables it to [...] "move from theory to practice", by using armed resistance [...] "to break with dependency and immovilism".|$|E
500|$|The {{events that}} {{transpire}} between the fourth to sixth films are effectively ignored in 1998’s [...] This film opens {{twenty years after}} {{the events of the}} second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that she could go into hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of her brother’s return. Her own son, John (Josh Hartnett), attends school where she teaches. Laurie’s fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John’s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael. [...] (2002) picks up three years after H20, and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic—crushing the paramedic’s larynx so that he could not talk—and that was who Laurie killed. Unable to deal with killing an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was still out there, Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael’s mask he surprises and kills her. Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield, but finds a group of college students filming an Internet reality show. Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), and the show’s creator Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).|$|E
