50|$|The first commercially {{available}} laser-based DLP HDTV was the Mitsubishi L65-A90 LaserVue in 2008, which also eliminated {{the use of}} a color wheel. Three separate color lasers illuminate the digital micromirror device (DMD) in these projection TVs, producing a richer, more vibrant color palette than other methods. See the <b>laser</b> <b>video</b> <b>display</b> article for more information.|$|E
5000|$|Proposed in 1966, laser {{illumination}} technology remained {{too costly}} {{to be used}} in commercially viable consumer products.At the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in 2006, Novalux Inc., developer of Necsel semiconductor laser technology, demonstrated their laser illumination source for projection displays and a prototype rear-projection [...] "laser" [...] TV.First reports on the development of a commercial Laser TV were published as early as February 16, 2006 with a decision on the large-scale availability of laser televisions expected by early 2008.On January 7, 2008, at an event associated with the Consumer Electronics Show 2008, Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America, a key player in high-performance red-laserand large-screen HDTV markets, unveiled their first commercial Laser TV, a 65" [...] 1080p model.A Popular Science writer was impressed by the color rendering of a Mitsubishi <b>laser</b> <b>video</b> <b>display</b> at CES 2008.Some even described it as being too intense to the point of seeming artificial.This Laser TV, branded [...] "Mitsubishi LaserVue TV", went on sale, November 16, 2008 for $6,999, but Mitsubishi's entire Laser TV project was killed in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Other media {{projects}} in-residence at Canada’s Banff Center in Alberta, involved musician David Hykes, of The Harmonic Choir. Together {{they developed}} a computer assisted laser/video work, which generated kinetic cycles of visual phenomena from Mr. Hykes’s music. One such installation, provided real-time, graphic representation of sound, employing a laser scanner and a digitally processed, video feedback loop to create images that were abstract and strikingly calligraphic. This appeared in the work, In Light of Sound, one of Mr. Rocco’s Andro-Media Series installations, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The New York State Council on the Arts funded event in collaboration Mr. Hykes and his Harmonic Choir used the two-thousand-year-old tradition of Mongolian overtone chanting, practiced by these musicians, to control the visual phenomena created by the system of scanning <b>lasers,</b> <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> and computer processor.|$|R
50|$|Laser color {{television}} (in short, Laser TV), or <b>Laser</b> color <b>video</b> <b>display</b> utilizes {{two or more}} individually modulated optical (laser) rays of different colors to produce a combined spot that is scanned and projected across the image plane by a polygon-mirror system or less effectively by optoelectronic means to produce a color-television display. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot {{at a time and}} modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a cathode ray tube, or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated {{in much the same way}} as with Digital Light Processing (DLP).|$|R

50|$|To {{keep the}} price of the {{computer}} and the component count down, a novel technique was used to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display.</b> Instead of an expensive <b>video</b> <b>display</b> controller chip with dedicated memory, the Super-80 used discrete TTL logic to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and 512 bytes of system RAM was shared between the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and the CPU. Fifty times per second, the CPU was turned off for around 10 ms by asserting the Z80 BUSREQ (DMA) pin. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry would then read from the shared RAM while it refreshed the image on the screen. In addition to a 50% degradation in processor performance, this meant that {{it was not possible to}} perform any accurate timing in software, since the programmer had no control over when the next <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refresh cycle would occur. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> could be switched off under software control for greater processing speed, or when accurate software timing was required. The most common situation in which that occurred was when the built-in cassette interface was being used. The location of the 512 bytes of video memory was normally at the top of the available RAM, but could be changed by writing to an I/O port.|$|R
50|$|In early 2016, {{the stadium}} {{was given an}} {{extensive}} facelift.

All together, the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> cover more than 28,000 sq ft, making Raymond James Stadium the third-largest <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium's luxury boxes were also upgraded. A second round of improvements are planned for after the 2016 season is complete.|$|R

5000|$|The VDU Expansion Board (VDUEB) was an {{enhanced}} <b>video</b> <b>display</b> {{board for the}} Super-80 developed by Microcomputer Engineering (MCE). The VDUEB gave the Super-80 an 80×25 <b>video</b> <b>display</b> with limited graphics capabilities. It {{was based on a}} 6845 CRTC I.C. and had its own 2kB of video RAM and 2kB of character generator RAM. Installation of the VDUEB board was a one-way process, as it required major modifications to the Super-80 printed circuit board including cutting of tracks and soldering in many wire links between various parts of the board. The VDUEB was then connected via three I.C. sockets formerly occupied by the original <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry. Removal of the original DMA based <b>video</b> <b>display</b> effectively doubled the performance of the computer, since the CPU was no longer being disabled 50 times per second for <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refreshes. The board gave the Super-80 similar <b>video</b> <b>display</b> capabilities to the Applied Technology Microbee computer, released about six months after the Super-80. This led to many Microbee games being ported to the VDUEB equipped Super-80. The VDUEB proved to be a popular modification, with a users' group forming for owners of VDUEB equipped computers - The [...] "Super-80 VDUEB Users' Club".|$|R
50|$|Dawgzilla is {{the name}} of the high {{definition}} LED <b>video</b> <b>display</b> board and sound system located behind the north end zone of Joe Aillet Stadium. The video board was designed, manufactured, and installed by Daktronics during the summer of 2009. The HD-X <b>video</b> <b>display</b> measures 25 feet high by 45 feet wide with a 16-millimeter pixel pitch. Two ribbon boards placed directly above and below the main <b>video</b> <b>display</b> each measure 4 feet high by 45 feet wide with 23-millimeter pixel pitches. The total <b>video</b> <b>display</b> area measures 1,485 square feet, which made Dawgzilla the largest video board in the Western Athletic Conference after its construction in 2009. Also installed atop the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> is a custom Sportsound sound system. The video board is mounted on a brick foundation constructed by Lincoln Builders and is flanked by artistic metal displays. The Dawgzilla project cost $2 million and was financed through a partnership with Learfield Sports and Community Trust Bank.|$|R
