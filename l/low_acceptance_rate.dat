40|$|In this master thesis an {{approximated}} forward-backward algorithm for binary Markov random fields {{is applied}} to and evaluated for a convolutional Bayesian model. The Bayesian model is transformed into its unique corresponding energy function of binary variables, where interaction parameters defines the function. We quantify {{the quality of the}} approximation by using an independent proposal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, where we apply the approximation to a variety of synthetic test cases. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> increases as the maximum number of neighbors increase, which was to be expected. Highest percentage was generated for a case with increased noise in the likelihood, with a resulting <b>acceptance</b> <b>rate</b> of 94. 95 % for 10 neighbors. The <b>lowest</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> were gained from low noise cases, and for the binary Markov chain prior an <b>acceptance</b> <b>rate</b> of 8. 03 % was registered. For this last mentioned case the approximation was also simulated without the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and compared with the aposteriori, where these two cases have approximately the same marginal probabilities. The same was seen for the four state Markov chain prior. Thus we conclude that the approximated forward-backward algorithm is viable even when the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generate <b>low</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates.</b> </p...|$|R

30|$|To {{measure the}} {{fairness}} of different strategies, we examine the number of low-quality papers published shown in Figs.  3 c, 4 c and 5 c. Considering K =  3 for example, the number of low-quality papers published are 405, 146 and 21 when the strategies are P-any, P-majority and P-all, respectively. We can see that if reviewers seek for strict quality selection by P-all or P-majority, the number of low-quality papers published will decrease. In other words, the reviewing process will be more fair. However, if the decision strategy chosen by an editor is too rigorous, the number of accepted papers may be too small, which {{may lead to a}} <b>low</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{properties of}} an optimization based sampler for targeting the posterior distribution when the likelihood is intractable and auxiliary statistics {{are used to}} summarize information in the data.

The sampler provides a conceptual framework to understand the difference between two types of likelihood free estimation.

40|$|A recent {{reformulation}} [1] of {{the problem}} of Coulomb gases {{in the presence of a}} dynamical dielectric medium showed that finite temperature simulations of such systems can be accomplished on the basis of completely local Hamiltonians on a spatial lattice by including additional bosonic fields.

40|$|Abstract: The {{method of}} {{tempered}} transitions was proposed by Neal (Stat. Comput. 6 : 353 – 366, 1996) for tackling the difficulties arising when using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from multimodal distributions. In common with {{methods such as}} simulated tempering and Metropoliscoupled MCMC, the key idea is to utilise a series of successively easier to sample distributions to improve movement around the state space. Tempered transitions does this by incorporating moves through these less modal distributions into the MCMC proposals. Unfortunately the improved movement between modes comes at a high computational cost with a <b>low</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>rate</b> of expensive proposals. We consider how the algorithm may be tuned to increase the acceptance rates for a given number of temperatures. We find that the commonly assumed geometric spacing of temperatures is reasonable in many but not all applications...|$|E
