5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> women, while the production of income depended on the <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, for example, Nancy Folbre {{examines}} {{the role of}} children as public goods and how the non-market <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> parents contributes {{to the development of}} human capital as a public service. In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E

5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> imprisoned black men and women, through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end with the Civil War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, Sharecropping and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E

5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.

5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E

5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made slaves). However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E
5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed {{a stream}} that is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.|$|E
