25|$|In the HD-SDI and dual link interfaces, {{synchronization}} packets {{must occur}} simultaneously {{in both the}} Y and C datastreams. (Some delay between the two cables in a dual <b>link</b> <b>interface</b> is permissible; equipment which supports dual link is expected to buffer the leading link {{in order to allow}} the other link to catch up). In SD-SDI and enhanced definition interfaces, there is only one datastream, and thus only one synchronization packet at a time. Other than the issue of how many packets appear, their format is the same in all versions of the serial-digital interface.|$|E

50|$|When two <b>linked</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{are set to}} {{different}} duplex modes, {{the effect of this}} duplex mismatch is a network that functions much more slowly than its nominal speed. Duplex mismatch may be inadvertently caused when an administrator configures an interface to a fixed mode (e.g. 100 Mbit/s full duplex) and fails to configure the remote interface, leaving it set to autonegotiate. Then, when the autonegotiation process fails, half duplex is assumed by the autonegotiating side of the link.|$|R
