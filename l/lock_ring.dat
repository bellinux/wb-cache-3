50|$|The {{rotating}} <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> door {{requires a}} safety interlock to prevent operation {{when there is}} any pressure in the autoclave. It is good practice to incorporate the ability to reverse the door <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> rotation {{at any time and}} without delay. With some doors, it is possible to swing them shut not quite far enough and then have the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> jam as it tries to close.|$|R

During {{the most recent}} recertification cycle, questions were raised concerning the ability of drum type containers with <b>locking</b> <b>rings</b> to survive the hypothetical accident sequence when the puncture test was oriented to specifically attack the <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> A series of tests has been performed that conclusively demonstrates that the specially designed <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> on the H 1616 performs adequately in this environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> at the base. Only the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> turns to <b>lock</b> the lens {{to the camera}} body; the lens body remains stationary. The later New FD lenses have a black mount which includes a lens release button.|$|R
5000|$|Track {{sprocket}} - There is no {{mechanism that}} allows the rider to coast. There are two sets of threads on the hub shell. The threads are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a track sprocket and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a reverse threaded <b>lock</b> <b>ring.</b> The reverse threads on the <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.|$|E

5000|$|The Cinegon {{anamorphic}} adapter can {{be distinguished}} from the front section of the initial 1960s Iscorama by verifying the front <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> inscription, which should read: ISCORAMA - CINEGON 1.8/10 - 1.5X ...|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} at the time used a slot in the metal to <b>lock</b> the <b>ring</b> to a jewel. Other features included a decorated face plate and a triangular cross-section. <b>Lock</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been found in}} modern-day Ireland, France, and Great Britain. Gold was used for the majority of <b>lock</b> <b>rings</b> that have been found, though other artifacts constructed out of bronze, or clay, gold and bronze composite have been found.|$|R

50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two <b>locking</b> <b>rings,</b> tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the bolt <b>locks</b> by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> is a {{threaded}} washer {{used to prevent}} components from becoming loose during rotation. They are found on an adjustable bottom bracket and a track hub of a bicycle. Lokring is another form of fastener used in the automotive and air condition industries. These fittings are often confused with lockrings.|$|E
5000|$|Freehub-- The {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} rider to coast {{is built into the}} hub. Splines on the freehub body allow a single sprocket or, more commonly, a cassette containing several sprockets to be slid on. A <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> then holds the cog(s) in place. This is the case for most modern bicycles.|$|E
50|$|Flip-flop, or {{double-sided}} hubs are threaded on both sides. Usually {{one side}} has a track-type threading (with <b>lock</b> <b>ring),</b> {{and the other}} side is threaded for a single-speed standard freewheel. It is possible to find them with track threading on both sides, but not easily. The cyclist can then change gears manually by reversing the drive wheel.|$|E

50|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} and some trucks {{may have a}} removable multi-piece rim assembly consisting of a base that mounts to the wheel and axle. They then have either a side ring or a side and <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> combination. These parts are removable from one side for tire mounting, while the opposite side attached to the base has a fixed flange.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 Iscorama was {{available}} in Exakta, Minolta SR, Nikon F, and Praktica M42 mounts and was the only Iscorama model to always feature an individual serial number on the front <b>lock</b> <b>ring.</b> They were shipped in blue and white packaging for the domestic German market, whilst export versions came in yellow and red boxes. None of this first generation of Iscoramas were multicoated.|$|E
50|$|The {{method used}} {{to lock the}} drum against the device frame is {{by the use of}} two {{straight}} knurl edge discs that are thrown outwards by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum's enclosed outer periphery. Two light return springs act as centrifugal force trips and as return springs to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame's <b>lock</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} door types available. These are {{proprietary}} designs having special characteristics which suit {{them to a}} variety of applications. For example, some door designs are simpler than the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> type, having no notched cutouts at all in the <b>locking</b> <b>rings.</b> They are easily operated by hand or power and intrinsically safe, much like the T-bolt configuration, in that any movement of the locking mechanism from closed toward open will release pressure well before the door and hub actually separate.|$|R
50|$|The DSP {{coupling}} locking {{principle is}} similar to that of the guillemin coupling.However, there are differences to the preformed serration on the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and the design of the lugs.|$|R
5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left hand threads {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized threads for the left hand lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The ISO {{threading}} for freewheels (Single or Multiple Speed) is {{the same}} as for track/fixed cogs. A standard single speed BMX style freewheel can be used on the track threads the hub. Because of the stepped down <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> threads, not as many threads of the freewheel engage the hub threads as they would if it were threaded to a freewheel threads, however, this is not a problem since the same number of threads are sufficient to secure a track cog. The force applied to a freewheel {{is the same}} as that applied to a fixed cog of the same size, so the missing threads cause no durability issue. Also, there is never any reverse torque on the threads with a freewheel, so a freewheel actually puts less strain on the threads than a fixed cog does.|$|E
50|$|Less commonly, {{there can}} be a failure in the {{presumption}} that a door breechlock ring cannot turn when the door is under pressure. The geometry of the camming ramps results in a precise rotational torque tending to open the door when pressure acts against the inside of the door. This force also creates a friction which resists this rotation. If the coefficient of friction on the ramps is low enough, then the <b>lock</b> <b>ring</b> can move on its own. It can even buckle the hydraulic actuators used to turn the ring. The interlock devices on autoclave doors are intended to prevent improper sequences, not to mechanically restrain the door against movement. Thus, the interest of safety is best served when the control system incorporates multiple devices providing not only redundancy but a variety of methods, the failure of any one of which cannot defeat the entire safety system.|$|E
5000|$|The 10-inch Mark 1 was a {{built-up}} gun {{constructed in}} {{a length of}} 31 caliber, Mod 0 and Mod 1, and also 35 caliber, Mod 2. These were both mounted in pairs on Mianonomoh and numbered 1-4 by the Navy. Both of the Mod 0 and Mod 1 guns had a tube, jacket, with the Mod 1 having a thicker jacket, and 15 hoops with a <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The hoops started [...] from the breech and extended to the muzzle. The Mod 2, was a 35 caliber gun of similar constructions but had only 14 hoops with a <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> These were all constructed of gun steel.|$|R
