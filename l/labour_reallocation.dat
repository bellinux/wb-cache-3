50|$|This theory {{states that}} {{migration}} flows and patterns can't be explained solely {{at the level}} of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration {{can be viewed as a}} result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These remittances can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital. Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers’ ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} regularities of the growth process is the massive <b>reallocation</b> of <b>labour</b> from agriculture into industry and services. Balanced growth models are commonly used in macroeconomics because they are consistent with the well-known Kaldor facts about economic growth.

This paper discusses models with generalized balanced growth paths. These paths retain some of the key features of balanced growth, but are consistent with the observed <b>labour</b> <b>reallocations</b> dynamics. The conventional explanation for the observed patterns of structural change is that the rate of technical progress has been higher in agriculture than in services. We show that this pattern of technical progress is neither necessary nor sufficient to account for the observed dynamics of structural change. The key to producing these reallocation dynamics are differences in the income elasticity of the demand for the goods produced by the different sectors. Growth; Structural Change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general equilibrium approach to calculating labour adjustment costs induced by trade policy changes or external sector shocks, which we illustrate {{by analyzing the}} adjustment consequences of eliminating quotas and tariffs on U.

The conventional way of calculating such labour adjustment costs is to use full equilibrium models which exclude adjustment costs, and apply exogenous estimates of duration of unemployment to implied intersectoral <b>labour</b> <b>reallocations.</b> By using an equilibrium model in which adjustment costs are absent, the conventional approach tends to overstate the amount of labour that moves to other sectors and hence introduces an upward bias to estimates of adjustment costs. As well, such an approach tends to ignore the impact on intersectoral wage rates. Our results suggest that concerns over adjustment problems should focus as much on the consequences of adjustment costs in impeding factor mobility, as on the magnitude of the adjustment costs themselves. Compared to the redistributive effects they induce by inhibiting labour movement in response to policy or other changes, these costs may be small. ...|$|R

40|$|Good {{health is}} an {{integral}} component {{of the quality of}} human life, a prerequisite for developing human potential and an important determinant of economic development. When a person is ill from a tropical disease in an agricultural economy, a complex interaction between the individual's welfare and the family's welfare is set in motion. So complex are these interactions that few empirical studies exist on this subject and even where they do, empirical quantification of these interactions and economic losses places the analyst in the minefield of valuing time, ability and contribution to economic welfare. Placing monetary values on these commodities is always a little unsatisfactory since dollar values do not adequately reflect the nature of the losses. Secondly, the ill person's struggle to minimize the economic effects of disease on family income will mask its true impact; thirdly, tropical diseases disproportionately affect low-income groups and therefore measuring the income effects of disease amongst these groups will only reach at the earnings effect, and underestimate the economic implications of tropical disease control. Despite these difficulties, quantification of the economic impact of disease is important from a public health point of view. This study is an attempt at such a task, and focuses on the intra-familial struggle to minimize economic losses due to malaria. Using a case-control approach, time-losses and <b>labour</b> <b>reallocations</b> within the household are examined in an attempt to understand the economic consequences of the disease.

Doing it quickly is painful, {{but only for a}} short moment. After that, one can start afresh. Fiscal policy must be similar, so the implicit reasoning goes. This analogy is false: quick austerity leads to overshooting in consumption and hence in a costly reallocation of labour from construction and domestics to tradables. The loss of industry specific human capital and the high unemployment associated with it is the main component of the cost of a recession. A pre-announced gradual approach works better. Wage flexibility reduces the need for <b>labour</b> <b>reallocation</b> by enabling declining industries to gain market share by cutting cost. Low unemployment benefits speed up adjustment by improving the incentives for the acquisition of new human capital. However, some degree of intergenerational insurance by a proper fiscal policy can reduce the need for costly <b>labour</b> <b>reallocation</b> in the first place.|$|E

40|$|A {{key factor}} for {{a stable and}} solid {{development}} is the gain in labor productivity. The regions that manage {{to pull out of}} poverty and improve the living standards of their inhabitants, in fact, {{need to be able to}} diversify away from agriculture and other traditional sectors. In doing this, the speed with which labour and other resources move to modern economic activities is the key factor that differentiates successful regions from unsuccessful ones. In the paper productivity growth is decomposed in two parts: the ?within? and the ?structural? variation. The first denotes the variation of productivity due exclusively to a change inside individual sectors (employment is kept unaltered) while the second term captures the productivity effect of <b>labour</b> <b>reallocations</b> across different sectors. It is essentially the inner product of productivity levels (at the end of the time period) with the change in employment shares across sectors. When changes in employment shares are positively correlated with productivity levels, this term will be positive, and structural change will increase economy-wide productivity growth. The spatial distribution of ?within? and ?structural? variation gives an interpretation of the spatial patterns that characterize European productivity growth and its sustainability in the long run. In the second part of the paper, to assess what are the impacts of the variables that play a role on ?structural? and ?within? variation, a cross-sectional growth regression model is used. At this regard, it is conceivable that the growth of productivity, and of its two components, depends on own region as well as neighbouring region characteristics, on the spatial connectivity structure of the regions, and on the strength of spatial dependence. In order to take account all these aspects in the analysis, a spatial Durbin model is adopted. This spatial econometric model allows also to solve both the problem of spatial dependence in the residuals and of omitted explanatory variables. Furthermore it includes both spatially lagged dependent and independent variables and allows to accounts for spatial spillover effects: a change in a single explanatory variable in a certain region has a ?direct impact? on that region as well an ?indirect impact? on other regions due to the spatial connectivity relationships. Finally regarding the conditioning variables included in the regression model, emphasis is put on the Structural Funds and on an institutional regional quality indicator.

Excess reallocation, the difference between worker flows and job flows at the plant level, is substantial.

Worker flows are very high for young workers to reduce drastically for workers after 35 years of age. The time series behaviour of worker flows and job excess reallocation from 1982 to 1996 is examined; worker level heterogeneity and employer level heterogeneity are discussed in determining the cyclical pattern of such flows and their rapid increment in more recent years.

This paper contributes to this research programme by examining the relationship between the churn and the cycle, specifically, aggregate unemployment.

With reasonably chosen parameter values, policy experiments show that the increased reallocation of capital and labour contributed as much as a 17 per cent improvement in aggregate labour productivity in the mid- 1980 s. When a positive total-factor-productivity shock occurs, in steady state the increase in aggregate productivity arises entirely from this shock, and reallocation is unaffected.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} made of five {{different}} chapters. Chp 1 : OPTIMAL FISCAL AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICY IN A TWO CLASS ECONOMY This paper deals with optimal taxation and provision of public goods in a two-class economy with non linear income and linear commodity taxes. As far as optimal taxation is concerned, we first show that with two private goods the good complementary with leisure should be taxed more heavily. Second the standard income tax rules are shown to be augmented by considerations for offsetting the distortions created on the commodity markets. As to the provision of public goods we extend recent results for a two class economy with public funds raised entirely {{by means of a}} non-linear income tax system. The standard Samuelson rule is modified by two additional terms related to the self selection constraint and to the revenue of indirect taxes. They are both shown to vanish when the agents' utility functions are weakly separable between public and private goods (taken together) and leisure. Chp 2 : DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAX EVASION: A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE The purpose of this selective survey of the literature on both income and commodity tax evasion is to show in which directions, the literature has evolved. Two main approaches are identified for both direct and indirect tax evasion literature. The so-called taxpayer's point of view approach which is basically an exercise of maximization under uncertainty and the so-called tax collector's point of view which is a refinement of the Mirrlees-Stiglitz approach to income taxation and of the Ramsey approach to commodity taxation. The current state of the art is such that both approaches share similar strengths and weaknesses. Chp 3 : TAX STRUCTURE, TAX REFORM AND TAX EVASION In this paper we explore whether the shift from an ad valorem tax to a value added tax (which is a prerequisite to join the European Union) improves the "integrity" (number of people in the regular market) and the "efficiency" (total tax revenues) of the tax system. A model of two parallel (black and regular) markets is analyzed. The production in both the black and the regular market is divided in three stages: raw material, intermediate good and final good. Firstly, we prove that if an ad valorem tax is levied, at all stages of the regular market, any, even partial, tax reform towards VAT unequivocally increases integrity (the number of agents). Secondly, we prove that efficiency of the tax system is a direct function of its integrity. Therefore a tax reform from ad valorem to VAT seems justifiable under these two criteria. As a passing result, regular market consumers' welfare is shown to increase. Chp 4. A NOTE ON CORRUPTION, PRODUCTION AND SHORTAGE IN USSR AND RUSSIA Shleifer and Vishny, 1992 argue that privatization increases production and reduces shortage; Komai, 1979 argues that privatization reduces both production and shortage. The transition from USSR to Russia reduced both production and shortage. We argue that this is just the result of the shrinking of the loss-making sector (industrial sector) and the expansion of the profit-making sector (the service sector and namely trade and retailing). We also argue that the validity of Kornai's model is limited to those firms which are overproducing (i. e. more than the profit maximization quantity) and the validity of Shleifer and Vishny's model is limited to those firms which are underproducing. This reconciles two otherwise contradictory papers. Chp 5 : <b>LABOUR</b> MARKET <b>REALLOCATION</b> AND RENT-SEEKING IN TRANSITION ECONOMY We present a simple two-sector model of the Russian labour market. Starting from a "full-employment" equilibrium with no search (the USSR), we analyze the path to the new equilibrium with unemployment and search (Russia). The links between the fraction of people searching, the wage differential and the hiring and firing probability of both sectors are investigated. A tentative way to compute these probabilities is proposed starting from recent (91 - 94) Russian data on unemployment and wages. It is shown that the wage differential across sectors rises with the strengthening of the entry barriers. It is argued that if no action is taken by the Authorities to fight unemployment and to reduce the wage differential across sectors (e. g. relaxing the entry barriers to the most productive sector), the market will react by developing, as an endogenous alternative to unemployment, a third sector which would act as a rent seeking one against the most productive sector. This will increase the outflow of workers from the least productive sector. Finally, it is shown that if the fraction of rent-seeking people attains a critical mass the above-mentioned policies {{may not be enough to}} rid the economy of the rent-seeking sector.
