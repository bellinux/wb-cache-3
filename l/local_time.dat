Our approach relies on a Feynman-Kac type large deviation for Brownian occupation time, certain localization techniques from Donsker-Varadhan (1975) and Mansmann (1991), and some general methods developed {{along the line of}} probability in Banach space.

The general results obtained are applied to Gaussian processes, and we show that with probability 1 the sample functions of a non-differentiable stationary Gaussian process with <b>local</b> <b>times</b> will be Jarnik functions.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the <b>local</b> <b>times</b> of a continuous-time Markov chain on an arbitrary discrete state space. For fixed finite {{range of the}} Markov chain, we derive an explicit formula for the joint density of all <b>local</b> <b>times</b> on the range, at any fixed time. We use standard tools from the theory of stochastic processes and finite-dimensional complex calculus. We apply this formula in the following directions: (1) we derive large deviation upper estimates for the normalized <b>local</b> <b>times</b> beyond the exponential scale, (2) we derive the upper bound in Varadhan’s Lemma for any measurable functional of the <b>local</b> <b>times,</b> (3) we derive large deviation upper bounds for continuous-time simple random walk on large subboxes of Z d tending to Z d as time diverges, and (4) we prove the analog of the well-known Ray-Knight description of Brownian <b>local</b> <b>times</b> for any nearest-neighbor continuous-time Markov chain on Z, with particularly explicit formulas for simple random walk. 1...|$|R
