5|$|The {{most stable}} isotope is astatine-210, {{which has a}} {{half-life}} of 8.1hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively <b>long-lived</b> (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter polonium-210. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely <b>long-lived</b> bismuth-209.|$|E
5|$|DBI {{provides}} caching for database {{handles and}} queries, which can greatly improve performance in <b>long-lived</b> execution environments such as mod perl, helping high-volume systems avert load spikes {{as in the}} Slashdot effect.|$|E
5|$|Flavian rule {{came to an}} end on September 18, 96, when Domitian was assassinated. He was {{succeeded by}} the {{longtime}} Flavian supporter and advisor Marcus Cocceius Nerva, who founded the <b>long-lived</b> Nerva–Antonine dynasty.|$|E
5|$|June 3, 1836: A <b>long-lived</b> tornado tracked 30miles (48km) from Dutchess County, New York to Salisbury, seriously {{injuring}} many people.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} <b>long-lived,</b> which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most <b>long-lived</b> freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.|$|E
5|$|See also Selenium-79 {{for recent}} changes in the {{measured}} half-life of 79Se, which are important for the dose calculations in the geological disposal of <b>long-lived</b> radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is <b>long-lived</b> for a mammal of its size. Individuals {{reportedly}} survived in captivity {{for up to}} 23 years, and a maximum age of up to 15 years seems possible in the wild.|$|E
5|$|There are 19 {{isotopes}} of neptunium {{with mass}} numbers from 225 to 244; {{they are all}} highly radioactive. The most popular among scientists are <b>long-lived</b> 237Np (t1/2 = 2.20 years) and short-lived 239Np, 238Np (t1/2 ~ 2 days).|$|E
5|$|There are 39 known {{isotopes}} of astatine, with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191–229. Theoretical modeling {{suggests that}} 37 more isotopes could exist. No stable or <b>long-lived</b> astatine isotope has been observed, nor is one expected to exist.|$|E
5|$|Wehha {{is thought}} to {{have been one of the}} {{earliest}} rulers of East Anglia, an independent and <b>long-lived</b> Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was established in the 6th century, and which includes the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} <b>long-lived</b> whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural <b>long-lived</b> radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the <b>long-lived</b> radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and <b>long-lived.</b> The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, <b>long-lived</b> tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|E
5|$|Among the 16 known {{isotopes}} of einsteinium {{with mass}} numbers from 241 to 257 the most affordable is 253Es. It is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate {{as compared with}} the isotopes of californium. Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a <b>long-lived</b> isotope 254Es (t1/2 = 275.5 days).|$|E
5|$|Anna {{was the son}} of Eni, {{a member}} of the ruling Wuffingas family, and nephew of Rædwald, king of the East Angles from 600 to 625. East Anglia was an early and <b>long-lived</b> Anglo-Saxon kingdom in which a duality of a {{northern}} and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|Ant colonies can be <b>long-lived.</b> The queens {{can live}} {{for up to}} 30years, and workers live from 1 to 3years. Males, however, are more transitory, being quite {{short-lived}} and surviving {{for only a few}} weeks. Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns are <b>long-lived</b> birds, {{with many}} {{reaching}} fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend {{in the number of}} individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.|$|E
5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are <b>long-lived</b> and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{cockatoo}}s, the red-tailed black cockatoo {{can be very}} <b>long-lived</b> in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist Neville Cayley reported one over fifty years old at Taronga Zoo. Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming <b>long-lived</b> radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take {{a few months to}} over a year. The adults are also <b>long-lived,</b> and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{can be very}} <b>long-lived,</b> {{especially}} in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived for more than 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are <b>long-lived</b> enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that <b>long-lived</b> deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|Helene was a <b>long-lived</b> Cape Verde-type {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in the extreme southeastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean, peaking as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale as it traversed the central Atlantic. It never affected land {{until the very end}} of its lifespan as a weak extratropical system, which had minor impact in the northern British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ioke, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Ioke, was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke was a record breaking, <b>long-lived</b> and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17days, reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on three different occasions.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ophelia was {{the fifteenth}} named {{tropical}} cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was a <b>long-lived</b> storm {{that was most}} remembered for its very erratic and extremely slow track off the East Coast of the United States, alternating several times between tropical storm and hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|In Kathmandu, Nepal, {{the sorcerer}} Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret {{compound}} Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal {{a few pages}} from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a <b>long-lived</b> sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{cockatoos}}, {{this species}} is <b>long-lived.</b> A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding {{when they were}} 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding. Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Long-lived</b> {{isotopes}} of nobelium and isotopes of lawrencium (and of heavier elements) {{have relatively}} short half-lives. For nobelium 11 isotopes are known with mass numbers 250–260 and 262. The chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were studied with 255No (t1/2 = 3 min) and 256Lr (t1/2 = 35 s). The longest-lived nobelium isotope 259No has a half-life of 1.5 hours.|$|E
5|$|Most {{neptunium}} (and plutonium) now {{encountered in}} the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 and the ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. The total amount of neptunium released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that {{have been carried out}} since 1963 is estimated to be around 2500kg. The overwhelming majority of this is composed of the <b>long-lived</b> isotopes 236Np and 237Np since even the moderately <b>long-lived</b> 235Np (half-life 396days) would have decayed to less than one-billionth (10−9) its original concentration over the intervening decades. An additional very small amount of neptunium, created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water, is released when the water is discharged into rivers or lakes. The concentration of 237Np in seawater is approximately 6.5×10−5millibecquerels per liter: this concentration is between 0.1% and 1% that of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} samarium has a radioactivity of 128Bq/g. It {{is composed}} of four stable isotopes: 144Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and three extremely <b>long-lived</b> radioisotopes, 147Sm (half-life t1/2 = 1.06 years), 148Sm (7 years) and 149Sm (>2 years), with 152Sm being the most abundant (natural abundance 26.75%). 149Sm is listed by various sources either as stable or radioactive isotope.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from {{spent nuclear fuel}} is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it comes out {{as a component of}} the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the <b>long-lived</b> isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is <b>long-lived,</b> and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{average life}} span is unknown but {{in common with}} seabirds such as the {{wandering}} albatross and Leach's storm petrel, frigatebirds are <b>long-lived.</b> In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md. Experiments and predictions {{suggest that the}} half-lives will then decrease, apart from 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of <b>long-lived</b> nuclei in the actinide series.|$|E
