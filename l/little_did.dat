25|$|The Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club {{and often}} {{performed}} for a live radio broadcast.

25|$|The {{company was}} {{initially}} called the Totten Light Artillery, {{in honor of}} the popular commander of the United States Arsenal at Little Rock from 1839 to 1860, William Totten. When Totten’s son, Captain James Totten, then commanding a U.S. Army artillery battery at the arsenal, cast his lot with the Union, following the seizure of the Little Rock Arsenal, the battery promptly changed its name to the Pulaski Light Artillery. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> they know that in a few short months they would be facing Totten's guns in battle.|$|E
25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, for an update on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> they know that the cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.|$|E
25|$|The 1804 {{silver dollar}} was {{actually}} produced in 1834, when the U.S. Department of State decided {{to produce a}} set of U.S. coins {{to be used as}} gifts to rulers in Asia in exchange for trade advantages. Since 1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and $10 Eagle, it was decided that the set would contain examples of those coins dated 1804, {{as well as the other}} denominations currently being produced. Mint officials, not realizing that the 19,000+ dollars recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803, proceeded to make new dies dated 1804. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> they know the stunning rarity they were creating. Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known to exist; in 1999, one of them sold at auction for more than $4 million. There are 8 Class I dollars, struck in 1834 for the aforementioned sets, 1 Class II dollar, struck over an 1857 Swiss Shooting Thaler (and now residing in the U.S. Coin Collection at the Smithsonian Institution), and 6 Class III dollars, struck surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand for the coin.|$|E

500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list {{and we went to}} this little cafe. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> I know we'd be playing that set for the next ten years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E

The next month he was posted to No.8 Squadron RNAS ("Naval Eight") flying Sopwith Pups on the Western Front, under fellow Australian Stanley Goble. [...] Little scored his first aerial victory on 23November, destroying an enemy two-seater north-east of La Bassée. By the following February, he had four victories {{to his credit}} and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for [...] "conspicuous bravery in successfully attacking and bringing down hostile machines". In one action on 4December, Little and Goble [...] "fought like mad" [...] against a large formation of German fighters, each claiming a Halberstadt; <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> not return to base with Goble and was thought lost, but had only landed near Allied lines to clear his jammed gun before taking off again to continue the fight.|$|E

[...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] is that {{the sound of the}} conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E

2500|$|In 1807 Margaron was {{assigned}} to the 1st Corps of Observation of the Gironde under Jean-Andoche Junot. Margaron and Antoine Maurin led brigades in the 1,754-man cavalry division under François Étienne de Kellermann. The mounted troops included one squadron each from the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th and 15th Dragoon and 26th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. All squadrons counted between 236 and 262 troopers. With Spain's permission, Junot's force crossed the Bidasoa River on 18 October 1807 and was in Salamanca by 12 November, prepared to invade Portugal. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> the Spanish know that Napoleon soon planned to overthrow their kingdom as well. Soon after Junot's corps launched the 1807 invasion of Portugal, logistical arrangements broke down and half the army's horses died. Nevertheless, on 30 November 1807, a 1,500-man French vanguard occupied Lisbon, having faced no military opposition. Then cavalrymen then remounted themselves with confiscated horses.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, jazz {{began to}} see its {{downturn}} and started to suffer. Jazz's potential for being linked with the down-trodden minorities and pariahs of German society - the blacks and Jews - rendered it suspect. The future policies emerging against Jazz were encouraged by German musicologists and radio spokesmen. In 1935, attempting to widen the perceived gap between [...] "Nigger-Jew Jazz" [...] and [...] "German Jazz", Hans Otto Fricke used his prominent status {{as the director of}} [...] "Radio Frankfurt", giving a two-part lecture series on the subject. To a great extent, Jazz shared a similar fate with other postwar modernist art such as atonal music. It wasn't until 1931 that many crucial British and American jazz players began to leave the country as they faced increasing xenophobic harassment from colleagues and authorities. [...] Many thought that the death of Jazz was upon them, but <b>little</b> <b>did</b> they anticipate that it would be reborn into vitality and health under a dictatorship.|$|E
