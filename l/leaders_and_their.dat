5|$|World <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> diplomats {{have taken}} note of Twitter's rapid {{expansion}} {{and have been}} increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark {{the opening of the}} London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.|$|E

In all, over fifty fascist <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} were found in the convoy and arrested by the partisans. Aside from Mussolini and Petacci, sixteen of the most prominent of them would be summarily shot in Dongo the following day and a further ten would be killed over two successive nights.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 September Chamberlain left Heston Aerodrome (to the east of today's Heathrow Airport) for his third and final visit to Germany. On arrival in Munich the British {{delegation}} was taken directly to the Führerbau, where Daladier, Mussolini and Hitler soon arrived. The four <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said {{that he intended to}} invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler's Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The draft was debated by the four leaders and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} poor {{performance}} and slow speed, the Zara-class cruisers {{did not see}} significant service with the fleet. They were too slow {{to be used as}} fleet scouts or flotilla <b>leaders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> gun armament was too weak for {{them to be able to}} protect torpedo boats from torpedo-boat destroyers. As a result, they spent most of the 1880s and 1890s , being reactivated briefly for training exercises. Sebenico returned to active service in 1893, alternating between sea duty with the training squadron and harbor service as a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1897, Spalato became assigned to the artillery school, while Zara was recommissioned for use in the torpedo school. That year, Sebenico took part in the only significant period of fleet service, when she was sent to the island of Crete to participate in an international naval demonstration during Greco-Turkish War. During the blockade, Sebenico stopped and sank a Greek vessel trying to break the blockade. Sebenico served in a variety of auxiliary roles over the following five years, before joining Spalato in the artillery school in 1903; the three ships served in their training roles until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, at which point they became guard ships.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{authorities}} {{considered that}} the alliance {{would mean that}} the Chetniks could continue to subvert Partisan units. On 30 April, the NDH authorities recognised the rights of Drenović and his troops to remain armed in order to fight the Partisans. The agreement between the NDH and Drenović's Chetniks was soon made public by the entire Ustaše press; Serb public opinion remained divided. By May, Drenović had a force of about 350 Chetniks. At mid-month, he signed an agreement with a Croatian general staff officer in Banja Luka agreeing to cooperate with the NDH in fighting the Partisans. Drenović soon {{emerged as one of the}} most important Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia. That summer, when order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone, Drenović and other Chetnik detachment <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> principal political spokesmen with Italian Second Army headquarters were recognized by the Italians as auxiliaries and early in the summer Italian commander Mario Roatta allowed for the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks. Other Chetnik leaders in Bosnia who had concluded alliances with the NDH by June 1942 included Mane Rokvić, Branko Bogunović, Stevo Rađenović and Momčilo Đujić. Historian Sabrina P. Ramet observes that this co-operation must be seen as a function of their mutual fear of the Partisans, and emphasizes the uncertainty and distrust that accompanied it. By June, Drenović's Chetniks numbered about 600 men.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries {{in the age of the}} War on Terror, the CIA funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Crips' initial {{formation}} there were only three Crip sets: Washington's East Side Crips (later called East Coast Crips), Williams' West Side Crips and the Compton Crips, led by a teenager named Mac Thomas.

They challenged the leaders of other gangs to one-on-one street fights. Many gang <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> members acquiesced and joined the Crips. The few gangs that resisted would later form the alliance known as the Bloods, and would become the Crips' fiercest rivals.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 {{study of}} social media sites by other Harvard {{researchers}} found that 13% of Internet posts were blocked. The blocking focused mainly on any form of collective action (anything from false rumors driving riots to protest organizers to large parties for fun), pornography, and criticism of the censors. However, significant criticisms of the government were not blocked when made separately from calls for collective action. Other study has showed comments on social media that criticisms of the state, its <b>leaders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> policies are usually published, but posts with collective action potential will likely to be censored more whether they are against the state or not.|$|E

25|$|After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of {{the group}} (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God-seekers) were {{cancelled}} by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: {{with the arrival of}} strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas.
