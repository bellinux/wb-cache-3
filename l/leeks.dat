5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), <b>leeks</b> and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the <b>leeks</b> for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, <b>leeks</b> and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the <b>leeks</b> for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables, beyond {{cabbages}} and <b>leeks,</b> were historically {{rare and}} the leek became a significant component of many dishes. It {{has been a}} national symbol of Wales for at least 400 years and Shakespeare refers to the Welsh custom of wearing a leek in Henry V.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the main}} {{objective}} of the NSR was to improve its mineral traffic from Caldon Low, the company did not view a link with <b>Leek</b> as a high priority and for a considerable time there was disagreement between the railway company, the promotors of the LMVLR {{and the people of}} <b>Leek</b> over whether to build a direct route from <b>Leek</b> to Waterhouses (the <b>Leek</b> curve), as the people of <b>Leek</b> wanted, or solely to build a curve away from <b>Leek</b> towards Stoke, as the railway company wanted. It took two years for the light railway order to be approved and the single line branch was not authorised until 1 March 1899 by the <b>Leek,</b> Caldon Low, and Hartington Light Railways Order 1898. [...] This order did not include the <b>Leek</b> curve at <b>Leek</b> Brook, and it took a further Act of Parliament, the North Staffordshire Railway Act 1899 (62 & 63 Vict. c.ccxxxi) to give the NSR the authority to build the <b>Leek</b> curve.|$|R
50|$|This {{left the}} line with public goods {{services}} from <b>Leek</b> to Stoke and bulk sand traffic from Oakamoor. The <b>Leek</b> services lasted until 1970 when the line between <b>Leek</b> and <b>Leek</b> Brook Junction closed but the Oakamoor sand traffic continued until 1988.|$|R
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, <b>leeks</b> and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and <b>leeks,</b> stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, <b>leeks,</b> garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E

5|$|The {{daffodil}} and the <b>leek</b> {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} <b>leek</b> {{can be traced to}} the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for <b>leek,</b> cenhinen, and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's <b>leek.</b> A report in 1916 gave preference to the <b>leek,</b> which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|R
5|$|There was mass {{unemployment}} among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary {{evidence shows that}} those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably. In addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn <b>leeks,</b> winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and <b>leeks.</b> The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, <b>leeks</b> and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E

5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, <b>leeks</b> and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, <b>leeks,</b> {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw <b>leeks</b> at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided {{it was a good}} omen. He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included <b>leeks,</b> garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of <b>leeks.</b> Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. <b>Leeks,</b> celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
