25|$|The Roman Breviary (Latin: Breviarium Romanum) is the <b>liturgical</b> <b>book</b> of the Latin liturgical {{rites of}} the Catholic Church {{containing}} {{the public or}} canonical prayers, hymns, the Psalms, readings, and notations for everyday use, especially by bishops, priests, and deacons in the Divine Office (i.e., at the canonical hours or Liturgy of the Hours, the Christians' daily prayer). The word breviary, in general, refers to a collection of Christian orders of prayers and readings, such as contained in Anglican or Lutheran resources. It may {{also be used to}} refer to an abridged version of any text or a brief account or summary of some subject, but is primarily used to refer to a Christian <b>liturgical</b> <b>book.</b> The volume containing the daily hours of Roman Catholic prayer was published as the Breviarium Romanum (Roman Breviary) until the reforms of Paul VI, when it became known as the Liturgy of the Hours. However, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the Office in all its forms. This entry deals with the Roman Breviary prior to the changes introduced by Pope Paul VI in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas' {{memory is}} celebrated {{on almost every}} Thursday of the year (together with the Apostles) with special hymns to him which {{are found in the}} <b>liturgical</b> <b>book</b> known as the Octoechos. Soon after the {{transfer}} of Saint Nicholas' relics from Myra to Bari, a Russian version of his Life and an account of the transfer of his relics were written by a contemporary to this event. Devotional akathists and canons have been composed in his honour, and are frequently chanted by the faithful as they ask for his intercession. He is mentioned in the Liturgy of Preparation during the Divine Liturgy (Eastern Orthodox Eucharist) and during the All-Night Vigil. Many Orthodox churches will have his icon, even if they are not named after him. In Oriental Orthodoxy, the Coptic Church observes the Departure of St. Nicholas on 10 Kiahk, or 10 Taḫśaś in Ethiopia, which corresponds to the Julian Calendar's 6 December and Gregorian Calendar's 19 December.|$|E

Marko later sought to reconcile with Jelena but he had to send Todora to his father-in-law. Since Marko's land was bordered on the south by Hlapen's, the reconciliation may have been political.

Paisius combined Ivan Vladislav and Jovan Vladimir into one character attributed with Vladislav's parentage and Vladimir's sainthood.|$|E

The Catholic bishop of Mostar Paškal Buconjić financed the printing of an Ottoman Turkish grammar in 1871. The Hebrew books included Meshek Beti (...) and Appe Zutre (...) , which list religious observances, respectively, on Shabbat and Passover, {{and a small}} <b>liturgical</b> <b>book</b> titled Tikkun Moda'ah.
