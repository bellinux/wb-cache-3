5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a <b>lobster</b> <b>trap</b> {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E

A <b>lobster</b> <b>trap</b> can catch multiple lobsters at once. The <b>lobster</b> <b>trap</b> was invented in 1808 by Ebenezer Thorndike of Swampscott, Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|Scully and Bonsaint {{drive to}} the Turner home. Scully, peering through the windows, discovers Melissa {{attempting}} to {{set fire to the}} house, with her, her daughter and Chinga all trapped inside. Bonsaint breaks down the nailed door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer which she, against her will, turns upon herself. Thinking quickly, Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen. As the doll melts, Melissa drops the hammer and regains her senses. Returning to the office on Monday, Scully downplays any excitement or involvement regarding the case, insisting that she was only relaxing on her vacation. [...] In the final scene, a fisherman is seen pulling up a <b>lobster</b> <b>trap,</b> and in it is the burned doll, which comes back to life.|$|E

500|$|The {{crinoline}} {{began to}} fall out of fashion from about 1866. A modified version, the crinolette, was a transitional garment bridging the gap between the cage crinoline and the bustle. Fashionable from 1867 through to the mid-1870s, the crinolette was typically composed of half-hoops, sometimes with internal lacing or ties designed to allow adjustment of fullness and shape. The crinolette was still worn in the early 1880s, with an 1881 article describing it as sticking out solely behind, as opposed to projecting [...] "hideously at the side" [...] like the crinoline. It is possible that some of the smaller crinolines that survive were worn in combination with separate bustles, rather than in isolation. During the 1880s the cage crinoline was revived, with hoop petticoats designed to accommodate the extremely large bustles of the period and support the skirt hems. One of the mid-1880s styles was called the lobster pot due to its resemblance to a <b>lobster</b> <b>trap.</b> Due to the extreme weight of the fabrics of the decade, the hoops of the crinolines were crossed over each other behind the legs in order to support and hold the skirts firmly in place. As with the earlier cage crinolines, sprung steel, wire and cane were used.|$|E

50|$|A <b>lobster</b> <b>trap,</b> in {{corporate}} finance, is an anti-takeover strategy used by target firms.

40|$|According to {{previous}} studies and anecdotal evidence {{there are a}} lot of lost <b>lobster</b> <b>traps</b> at the Saba Bank. One study estimated the loss to be between 210 and 795 <b>lobster</b> <b>traps</b> per year. The Saba Bank is an approximately 2, 200 km 2 submerged area and spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) is one of the main fisheries with an annual economic value over USD 1 million. The traps get lost due to a combination of bad weather moving or damaging traps and marker buoy lines, ship traffic running into and cutting marker buoy lines and removal of marker buoy or theft of traps by vandals. Lost traps are a concern for the Saba Bank fisheries management, because of the potential impact of ghost fishing by lost traps and the damage to the benthic environment. IMARES was commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation to advise on a method to detect lost <b>lobster</b> <b>traps.</b> The objective of this desk study was to provide information for the sustainable management of the lobster fisheries and the conservation of the Saba Bank. In this report we investigate the most efficient method for the detection of lost <b>lobster</b> <b>traps</b> from a small vessel in water between 15 and 50 meter depth. We not only address methods for the location of traps, but also recommend methods for the retrieval of traps and measurement of ghost fishing. Side scan sonar in combination with a magnetometer is recommended as the best, most efficient method to locate lost <b>lobster</b> <b>traps</b> in order to retrieve them. This is not necessarily the most cost-efficient method to respond to the problem of future traps loss, as preventive measures tend to be more effective and less costly than curative measures. However, a detection survey can be used to better estimate the magnitude of the problem of already lost traps. It is not realistic that a detection survey can locate all lost traps that are present on the Saba Bank...|$|R
40|$|Most lobster {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by high exploitation rates. This has led to substantial declines in the size structures of the populations over time as larger lobsters have been removed. Although both scientists and fishers have suggested that size related hierarchies could impact on <b>lobsters</b> entering <b>traps,</b> {{the effect of the}} size change on the selectivity of <b>lobster</b> <b>traps</b> as a population's size structure changes has not been investigated. This paper demonstrates that larger lobsters affect the entrapment of smaller lobsters and that this behaviour affects the selectivity of <b>lobster</b> <b>traps.</b> Both spatial and temporal (within season) factors were found to affect the selectivity plots. Spatial differences in selectivity were attributed to the broader size range of larger lobsters found in regions of faster growth. Temporal differences were attributed to the decline in larger lobsters {{over the course of a}} season caused by exploitation. There are also differences in trap selectivity between the sexes...|$|R
