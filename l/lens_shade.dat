50|$|Most welding helmets {{include a}} window {{covered with a}} filter called a <b>lens</b> <b>shade,</b> through which the welder can see to work. In most helmets, the window may be made of tinted glass, tinted plastic, or a variable-density filter made {{from a pair of}} {{polarized}} lenses.|$|E
5000|$|Welding helmets {{protect the}} eyes and face and neck from flash burn, {{ultraviolet}} light, sparks and heat. They have a small window, called a <b>lens</b> <b>shade,</b> through which the welder looks at the weld; for arc welding this window must be much darker than in blowtorch goggles and sunglasses.|$|E

50|$|The {{satellite}} de-orbited by retracting {{the lens}} into the special equipment module. The other two modules and the <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> separated and burnt {{up in the}} atmosphere. The reentry vehicle then landed on the ground. The computer and camera were designed to be reusable. The craft contained a self-destruct mechanism.|$|E
50|$|A 28 mm f/2.8 shift lens with 67EW {{filter thread}} and a <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> with filter holder for 74R rimless filters and M92x1.00 filter ring. Many user-changeable mechanically-only mount modules {{available}} from Schneider Kreuznach. Also available as Leica PC-Super-Angulon R 28 mm f/2.8 with Leica R mount. Can be modified from a shift-only lens to a tilt-only lens by the German company.|$|E
50|$|The lens was a fixed 25-50 mm f/4.5-16 manual focus zoom with macro {{focusing}} down to 11 in (280 mm). This gave a {{field of}} view range approximately equivalent to a 50-100 mm zoom lens on a 35 mm format camera. There was a built-in, pop out <b>lens</b> <b>shade.</b> The filter thread diameter was 40.5 mm. Minolta sold UV, yellow and 1B filters.|$|E
40|$|In this {{contribution}} it {{is argued}} that vision systems urgently require an open camera to lens communication standard. Traditional machine vision systems are built out of components that are manufactured by different vendors. New lens mounts with an open camera to lens communication standard would also allow machine vision systems to incorporate features that are already common in commercial products. This includes the automatic correction of various types of lens aberrations, including geometric distortion, lateral chromatic aberration, and <b>lens</b> <b>shading.</b> The lack of an open camera to lens communication standard is, however, an even more serious obstacle because modern techniques of computational imaging cannot find wide-spread application in machine vision systems. An open camera to lens communication standard opens up wide-range application to all kinds of computational imaging systems and the machine vision industry is well advised to implement such a standard...|$|R

50|$|In {{his work}} as an amateur photographer, his {{photographs}} were widely published across Canada. He also corresponded with George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, about photographic technology, and published in photographic journals {{on the subject of}} technological innovation. He built his first camera out of a oblong box covered in black oil cloth, and went on to design and build such items of equipment as an exposure timing chart, a <b>lens</b> <b>shade,</b> and a fixing tank.|$|E
50|$|In photography, a {{lens hood}} or <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> is a device {{used on the}} front end of a lens to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and lens flare. Lens hoods may also be used to protect the lens from {{scratches}} and the elements without having to put on a lens cover.The geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three things: the focal length of the lens, the size of the front lens element and the dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Proper eye {{protection}} and face shields {{are needed to}} prevent eye damage called arc eye as well as damage from debris. It is recommended to use green <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> #5. OSHA recommends a shade 8 for arc current less than 300, but notes that [...] "These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece." [...] Lincoln Electric, a manufacturer of plasma cutting equipment, says, [...] "Typically a darkness shade of #7 to #9 is acceptable."

5000|$|During an {{accidental}} radiation leak {{that ended in}} an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Otto Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain {{so that he could}} control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself [...] "Dr. Octopus" [...] from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him. Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is near-sighted, with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with <b>shaded</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Humankind {{has long}} {{endeavored}} {{to control the}} propagation direction of light. Since time immemorial, <b>shades,</b> <b>lenses</b> and mirrors {{have been used to}} control the flow of light. In modern society, with the rapid development of nanotechnology, the control of light is moving toward devices at micrometer and even nanometer scales. At such scales, traditional devices based on geometrical optics reach their fundamental direction limits and cease to work. Nano photonics, on the other hand, has attracted wide attention from researchers, especially in the last decade, due to its ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale. This review focuses on the nano photonics systems that aim to select light based on its propagation direction. In {{the first half of this}} review, we survey the literature and the current state of the art focused on enabling optical broadband angular selectivity. The mechanisms we review can be classified into three main categories: (i) microscale geometrical optics, (ii) multilayer birefringent materials and (iii) Brewster modes in plasmonic systems, photonic crystals and metamaterials. In the second half, we present two categories of potential applications for broadband angularly selective systems. The first category aims at enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting, through photovoltaic process or solar thermal process. The second category aims at enhancing light extracting efficiency and detection sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the most prominent challenges in broadband angular selectivity and some prospects on how to solve these challenges. Comment: 14 page, 11 figure...|$|R
