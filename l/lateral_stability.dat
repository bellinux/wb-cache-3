40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} part of a larger assignment which is an analysis of <b>lateral</b> string <b>stability</b> and the development of a controller design method with guaranteed <b>lateral</b> string <b>stability.</b> <b>Lateral</b> string <b>stability</b> is an issue when a look-ahead sensing method is used in combination with a vehicle-following control strategy. The coupling between vehicles enables errors to increase while they propagate upstream through a string of vehicles. Communicating desired yaw rate or lateral acceleration and use this information for controller design could be an option to achieved guaranteed <b>lateral</b> string <b>stability.</b> One of the applications of lateral control will be conducting maneuvers like merging or lane changes. During these maneuvers the side-slip angles of the tyres stay within the 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆einterval of linear tyre response, this means that side-slip angles of the tyres are within 0 : 5. On this interval the non-linear and linearized tyre model have the same linear response. This makes is possible to use a linearized vehicle model with linear tyres for the modeling of the lateral and yaw dynamics of the vehicle. This is validated using experimental data and it is shown that the response of the linearized vehicle model is almost equal to the actual vehicle response...|$|R

5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} {{soundness}} of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} aerodynamics testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with <b>lateral</b> <b>stability,</b> resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

The tests covered the effects produced by variations of wing aspect ratio, dihedral, and sweepback, and by ground proximity, on longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> static <b>stability.</b> Some of the more significant results outside ground influence include the high stalling incidence and CLmax values possible with a thick, heavily cambered jet-flap wing and the unexpected effects of the jet flap on <b>lateral</b> static <b>stability.</b> Proximity to the ground produced appreciable changes in downwash at the tailplane {{as soon as the}} jet sheet neared the ground, and caused large reductions in lift and stalling incidence once jet impingement occurred...|$|R
30|$|Tests of the <b>lateral</b> and {{torsional}} <b>stability</b> {{are quite}} {{sensitive to the}} experimental conditions, such as support conditions and loading system. Controlling all of these conditions in a full-size test is a very challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, an experimental measurement method that can control the experimental conditions using a small-scale model was proposed to evaluate the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> of beams. For this, a loading system was provided to maintain the vertical direction of the load applied to the beam, and a support frame was produced to satisfy the in-plane and out-of-plane support conditions. The experimental method using a small-scale model was applied successively to the lateral and torsional behavior and stability of I-shaped beams. The proposed experimental methods, which effectively accommodate {{the changes in the}} geometry and length of the beam, could contribute to further experimental studies regarding the <b>lateral</b> and torsional <b>stability</b> of flexural members.|$|R
40|$|Nonplanar {{wing tip}} mounted lifting {{surfaces}} reduce lift induced drag substantially. Winglets, which are small, nearly vertical, winglike surfaces, are {{an example of}} these devices. To achieve reduction in lift induced drag, winglets produce significant side forces. Consequently, these surfaces can seriously affect airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. Therefore, the effects of nonplanar wing tip mounted surfaces on the <b>lateral</b> directional <b>stability</b> and control of low speed general aviation airplanes were studied. The study consists of a theoretical and an experimental, in flight investigation. The experimental investigation involves flight tests of winglets on an agricultural airplane. Results of these tests demonstrate the significant influence of winglets on airplane lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics. It is shown that good correlations exist between experimental data and theoretically predicted results. In addition, a lifting surface method was used to perform a parametric study {{of the effects of}} various winglet parameters on <b>lateral</b> directional <b>stability</b> derivatives of general aviation type wings...|$|R
25|$|Regular {{inspection}} of the ballast shoulder is important; as noted earlier, the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of the track depends upon the shoulder. The shoulder acquires some amount of stability over time, being compacted by traffic; maintenance tasks such as replacing ties, tamping, and ballast cleaning can upset this stability. After performing these tasks, {{it is necessary for}} either trains to run at reduced speed on the repaired routes, or to employ machinery to compact the shoulder again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} of analyzing the flight dynamic stability of a flapping wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) in hover. The flexible flapping wings are modeled by a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam formulation, {{coupled with an}} empirical aero-dynamic formulation for load calculation on the wings surfaces.

Nonlinear equations of motion for the body frame attached to the vehicle are used to complete the coupled aeroelastic and flight dynamic formulation. All these formulations are implemented in an integrated numerical framework. To evaluate the flight dynamic stability of the hovering flapping wing MAV, the coupled nonlinear governing equations are linearized, and the transition matrix over a wing flapping cycle is determined. By {{taking advantage of the}} periodic hovering condition, the stability analysis is performed based on the transition matrix in the Floquet theory.

25|$|Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing {{swept back}} at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident {{has the same}} {{sweepback}} angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32°. The wing also has anhedral (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> compared to their Western counterparts, but also have weaker Dutch roll tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{commenced}} in October 1914, and {{was completed}} by spring 1915. Early test flights, probably limited to short hops, revealed multiple shortcomings in the design. As originally completed, the wings were braced between {{the second and third}} cell by only a single strut. Reinforcements to the wings added a second strut aft of this position, together with a set of diagonal struts to support the overhang of the upper wings Other modifications at this time included rigging the wings with a slight dihedral to improve <b>lateral</b> <b>stability,</b> adding a second tailfin and rudder to improve control, and grafting an open gun position onto the front of the fuselage to improve the aircraft's centre of gravity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lateral</b> {{steering}} <b>stability</b> is {{a critical}} parameter of driving performance i?om both a theoretical as well as applied per-spective. The measurement of <b>lateral</b> steering <b>stability</b> in a driving simulation environment is both straightforward and ubiquitous.

40|$|Surface {{properties}} of ovalbumin {{and of its}} putative signal sequence, and their interactions with phospholipids at an air-water interface, have been studied. The mature protein can form an interfacial film spontaneously from its bulk solution, whereas the signal sequence cannot. Mature ovalbumin also penetrates phospholipid monolayers from the subphase (independently {{of the type of}} phospholipid present), whereas its signal sequence does not. The surface stability of a spread film of the signal sequence is, however, higher than that of a film of mature ovalbumin. Above specific threshold concentrations of signal peptide and of mature ovalbumin in mixed films with phospholipids, two separate phases are formed. In such immiscible films, the signal sequence peptide is also able to support a higher lateral surface pressure than mature ovalbumin, at corresponding areas of peptide and mature protein in the mixed monolayers. It is suggested that the differing <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilities</b> of ovalbumin and of its putative signal sequence may be relevant to the translocation of ovalbumin across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and a scheme for its translocation is proposed that is based on these properties...|$|R

The second, Jupiter-engined Badger, flew on 24 May but was re-engined with a Dragonfly and was purchased by the Air Board in September. It had full armament and a fixed, rounded fin, introduced {{to cope with the}} heavier Jupiter engine. The Badger proved to have a <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> problem, an adverse yaw effect caused by aileron drag, and because of this, the third machine was not accepted by the Air Board.

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the <b>lateral</b> <b>stability</b> of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E
