5000|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{there was much}} {{interest}} in enclosing and [...] "improving" [...] the open moorland on Dartmoor, encouraged by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt's early successes at Tor Royal near Princetown.

In February 1809 one Thomas Windeatt, from Bridgetown, Totnes, took over the <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> a <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> land (a [...] "newtake") of about 582 acres in the valley of the River Swincombe.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{situation}} of individual farms in Georgia using a survey conducted in 2003, in comparison to a similar survey conducted in 1996. The basic issue investigated is the progress of the land individualization process, and the consequences of this process for the development of the agricultural sector, and more generally for the well-being of farm families and rural poverty. We found significant changes in the farm sector. In particular, average landholdings have increased, mainly through <b>leasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> There is more specialization, with some farmers not producing at all and others expanding. Profits and income have deteriorated markedly, and many producers did not even sell their produce on the market. Those producers who leased land were much more likely to sell their produce on the market and they also had higher incomes and relied less on off-farm income and social assistance payments. Still, fewer than 15 % <b>of</b> the farmers <b>lease</b> land. While the average age of the population has increased, the level of schooling declined. This indicates a possible “brain drain” process of selective outmigration. Another worrying implication of the income situation is the increase in the incidence of child labor. These findings indicate that the potential of increased land transactions is still there, and a continuing specialization process that will enable successful farmers to acquire more land could improve the economic well-being of farm families even in a period of depressed produce prices. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{ownership}} and <b>leasing</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land {{by women in}} four regions of England throughout the nineteenth century including Oxfordshire and surrounding counties (agricultural); West Yorkshire (industrial); London (the metropolis); and Durham (mining). Innovative research was linked to standard econometric analysis utilising {{a new source of}} information about land, namely the books of reference produced by the railway companies. These books had unique advantages, particularly as legal documents scrutinised by Parliament and the public. Information was compiled about 23, 966 plots including their uses and details <b>of</b> ownership, <b>leasing</b> and occupation; with a minimum sample <b>of</b> 400 <b>plots</b> per region, per decade. The women were recorded when identified in the documents as owners, lessors or lessees. The study compares the uses <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> with a woman owner or lessee with plots owned by men or institutions. The influence of parish characteristics and the roles of common law and equity on women’s plot ownership are considered, especially the effects of the Married Women’s Property Acts of 1870 and 1882. On average women owned 12. 4 per cent <b>of</b> the sampled <b>plots</b> and leased 3. 8 per cent, with regional variations. Plot usage and location were important at regional and parish level with women adapting their ownership to local economic conditions. Differences were found between the uses <b>of</b> women-owned <b>plots</b> and those owned by men and institutions. The greatest percentage <b>of</b> women-owned <b>plots</b> everywhere were owned or leased by women with no male or institutional co-owners. There was a multi-regional, long-term time trend towards a greater involvement <b>of</b> women in <b>plot</b> ownership during the century, with a spike in women’s ownership in Yorkshire and London during the Railway Mania. The Married Women’s Property Act of 1870 reduced women’s ownership <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in every region except London, whereas the 1882 Married Women’s Property Act had mixed effects across the regions. Overall, the research challenges the view that legal and social constraints confined women’s ownership of land to wealthy widows and spinsters and shows that ownership was far more widespread than has been supposed.

5000|$|The General Lying-In Hospital {{was opened}} in April 1767 as the Westminster New Lying-in Hospital, {{on the north}} side of Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth, then on the {{outskirts}} of London. Lying-in is an archaic term for childbirth; the institution was a maternity hospital. Dr. John Leake was its first physician. The hospital admitted single mothers as well as married women.Early in the 1820s the governors decided to move to new premises. They acquired a building <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> a <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> ground with 100-foot frontage at [...] on the east side of York Road, Lambeth.

On 22 September 1828, the minutes record that “On Friday Morning a Patient was delivered of a Son in the New Hospital and the Committee met this day in the new Hospital for the first time.” The name “Westminster” was dropped from the title and the institution was incorporated by royal charter in 1830 as “The General Lying-in Hospital".|$|R
500|$|In April 1928, Reynolds {{signed a}} 67-year <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> and {{finalized}} {{the details of}} his ambitious project. Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a decorative jewel-like glass crown. It also featured a base in which the showroom windows were tripled in height and topped by 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, creating an impression that the tower was floating in mid-air. Originally, the skyscraper would have risen , with 67 floors. When Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) praised the plan's deviations from the designs of previous skyscrapers, as well as its unique architecture. Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite the initial opposition of Van Alen. These plans were approved in June 1928. The metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like [...] "a jeweled sphere" [...] at night.|$|R

These were not year-round cottages, but simple wooden structures built along walks that lined the Lake Michigan shore.|$|R
