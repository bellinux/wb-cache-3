5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the <b>licence</b> <b>application.</b> The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire.

The squad's directeur sportif, Joxean Fernández Matxin, appealed to other companies for their backing, but later allowed the likes of Cobo and de la Fuente to search for new teams for the 2012 season.|$|E
