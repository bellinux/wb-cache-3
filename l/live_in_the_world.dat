25|$|The Order is {{considered}} by the Catholic Church {{to be under the}} special protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and thus has a strong Marian devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. As in most of the orders dating to medieval times, the First Order is the friars (who are active/contemplative), the Second Order is the nuns (who are cloistered), and the Third Order consists of laypeople who continue to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and can be married, but participate in the charism of the order by liturgical prayers, apostolates, and contemplative prayer. There are also offshoots such as active Carmelite sisters.|$|E
25|$|A {{religious}} institute is an {{institute of}} consecrated life whose members take public vows, lead {{a life in}} common, and are in some way separated from the world. A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life whose members <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> strive for the perfection of charity and seek to help to sanctify the world, especially from within. The current Code of Canon Law has not maintained the distinction that the earlier Code (1917) made between orders (religious institutes in which the members took solemn vows) and congregations (those in which simple vows were taken).|$|E

500|$|The monument's three {{divisions}} {{symbolize the}} three [...] "realms" [...] of Buddhist cosmology, namely Kamadhatu (the world of desires), Rupadhatu (the world of forms), and finally Arupadhatu (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings {{live out their}} lives on the lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvana. The liberation from the cycle of Saṃsāra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of Śūnyatā, the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self. Kāmadhātu is represented by the base, Rupadhatu by the five square platforms (the body), and Arupadhatu by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the Rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in the Arupadhatu to represent how the world of forms—where men are still attached with forms and names—changes into the world of the formless.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in that most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more widely than the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E

Several of the Valar have characteristics resembling various Æsir, the gods of Asgard. Thor, for example, physically the strongest of the gods, can be seen both in Oromë, who fights the monsters of Melkor, and in Tulkas, the physically strongest of the Valar.

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Buckingham in 1623, the King ends with, [...] "God bless you, my sweet child and wife, and grant that ye may ever be a comfort to your dear father and husband".

[...] Restoration of Apethorpe Palace in 2004–8 revealed a previously unknown passage linking his bedchamber with that of James.
