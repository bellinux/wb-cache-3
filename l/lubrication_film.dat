50|$|Steel {{reinforced}} v-belts {{are sufficient}} for low-mass low-torque applications like utility vehicles and snowmobiles but higher mass and torque {{applications such as}} automobiles require a chain. Each element of the chain must have conical sides that fit the pulley when the belt is running on the outermost radius. As the chain moves into the pulleys the contact area gets smaller. As the contact area {{is proportional to the}} number of elements, chain belts require lots of very small elements. The shape of the elements is governed by the static of a column. The pulley-radial thickness of the belt is a compromise between maximum gear ratio and torque. For the same reason the axis between the pulleys is as thin as possible. In a chain-based CVT a film of lubricant is applied to the pulleys. It needs to be thick enough so that the pulley and the chain never touch and it must be thin in order not to waste power when each element dives into the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film.</b> Additionally, the chain elements stabilize about 12 steel bands. Each band is thin enough so that it bends easily. If bending, it has a perfect conical surface on its side. In the stack of bands each band corresponds to a slightly different gear ratio, and thus they slide over each other and need oil between them. Also the outer bands slide through the stabilizing chain, while the center band can be used as the chain linkage.|$|E

Measurements were made in a hip joint simulator {{based on the principle}} of pendulum. For the friction measurements artificial joints, made from three material combinations and two diameters, from two companies were used. The measurements show that the material combination has a more significant effect to friction coefficient than the head size. Using a bigger head size shows a decrease in friction coefficient for all material combinations when compared to a smaller head size. For the measurement of <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> the colorimetric interferometry was applied. A metal-on-glass contact pair was used, where the glass cups were made according to the real measurements of the joint cups. Four types of hip replacements with diameters of 28 and 36 mm with two different diametral clearance were measured during a constant motion of 210 seconds. Measurements show, that the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> in the hip joint with a small diametral clearance increases very fast over the 800 nm value. Contact surfaces in the hip joint with a large diametral clearance aren’t separated by the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film,</b> resulting in a damage of the chromium coating in cup.

We focus on the regime at low capillary number and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to investigate the problem. In {{order to reduce the}} computational cost, an adaptive mesh is employed and high mesh resolution is only used near the interface. Paramet-ric studies are performed on the droplet horizontal radius and the capillary number. For droplets with an horizontal radius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel and exhibits a pancake shape. A <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> is formed between the droplet and the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> on the droplet velocity. The computed velocity of the pancake droplet is shown to be lower than the average inflow velocity, which is in agreement with experimental measurements.

In this low-migration-velocity scenario the interfacial flow in the droplet reference frame moves toward the rear on the top and reverses direction moving to the front from the two side edges.

Scanning electronic microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface roughness, and thermogravimetric analyses were used to investigate the surface element content, chemical valence state, surface roughness, and initial decomposition temperature of the oil samples, respectively. Results showed that the average wear scar diameter (AWSD) and friction coefficient of the two kinds of carbon black-contaminated lubricants decreased {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 wt% TiF 3. The variation rates of the carbon black-contaminated liquid paraffin and fully formulated engine lubricating oil were 29. 45 % and 11. 54 %, respectively, and their initial decomposition temperatures decreased. These phenomena were ascribed to the decomposition of TiF 3 catalyst into TiO 2 and fluoride that resulted in the formation of improved boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>films.</b> Moreover, for the fully formulated engine oil, the lubrication additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate was catalyzed by TiF 3, decomposing into polyphosphate, which aided the formation of mixture boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elastohydrodynamic {{model of the}} human eyelid wiper. Standard lubrication theory {{is applied to the}} fluid layer between the eyelid wiper and ocular surface. The role of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> is to reduce the shear stresses by preventing solid to solid contact between the eyelid wiper and ocular surface. For the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> to be effective, it is required that the orientation of the eyelid wiper changes between the opening and closing phases of a blink. In order to model this, the hydrodynamic model is coupled with an elastic mattress model for the soft tissue of the eyelid wiper and ocular surface. This leads to a one-dimensional non-linear partial differential equation governing the fluid pressure in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film.</b> In order to solve the differential equation, a loading condition or constraint equation must be specified.

It is found that the pressure and shear stress under the eyelid act across a length of approximately 0. 1 mm which is consistent with clinical observations.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} motion of {{droplets}} in a confined, micrometric geometry, {{by focusing on the}} <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> between droplet and wall. When capillary forces dominate, the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> thickness evolves non linearly with the capillary number due to viscous dissipation between meniscus and wall. However, this film may become thin enough (tens of nanometers) that intermolecular forces come into play and affect classical scalings. Our experiments yield highly resolved topographies of the shape of the interface and allow us to bring new insights into droplet dynamics in microfluidics. We report the novel characterization of two dynamical regimes as the capillary number increases: (i) at low capillary numbers, the film thickness is constant and set by the disjoinging pressure, while (ii) above a critical capillary number, the interface behavior is well described by a viscous scenario. At a high surfactant concentration, structural effects lead to the formation of patterns on the interface, which can be used to trace the interface velocity that yield direct confirmation of boundary condition in viscous regime. The dynamics of a droplet confined between solid walls and pushed by a surrounding liquid is an old problem, however recent theories are still being developed to describe unexplored regimes and experimental characterizations are still lacking to shed light on these novel developments. A complete understanding of the droplet velocity calls for accurate knowledge of the dissipation mechanisms involved, particularly in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film.</b> Our understanding of the lubrication properties of menisci travelling in confined geometries has been steadily refined since the pioneering work of Taylor & Saffman [1]. Notably, the influence of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> left along the wall by the moving meniscus was first taken into account by Bretherton, who investigated {{the motion of}} an inviscid bubble in a cylindrical tube [2]. Far from the meniscus, this dynamical film reaches a uniform thickness h ∞, related to the bubble velocity through the capillary number Ca = µ f U d /γ, where U d is the bubble velocity, µ f the viscosity of the continuous phase, and γ the surface tension. When the capillary pressure dominates over the viscous stress, i. e. in the regime where Ca 1, the thickness of the film follows h Breth = 1. 34 r Ca 2 / 3, where r is the radius of the capillary tube. Besides bubbles, the case of viscous droplets remains however largely unexplored. A recent theoretical advance in the field by Hodges et al. [3] shows by numerical calculations of the whole flow pattern that significant corrections in the thickness of lubrication films can arise at very low Ca. Furthermore, the regime of the Bretherton theory is only valid for lubrication films thicker than the molecular sizes or than the range of interfacial interactions.
