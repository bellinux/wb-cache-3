Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default <b>letter</b> <b>spacing,</b> finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E
500|$|The arm {{and frame}} {{components}} were {{replaced with a}} cylindrical platen in 1869. Unlike modern typewriters, the revised machine entered letters around the cylinder, with axial rotation providing <b>letter</b> <b>spacing</b> and horizontal shifting providing line spacing. Paper was clipped directly to the cylinder, which limited its length and width to {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus. The platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow the use of paper of any length. The redesigned platen also introduced the modern spacing functionality (horizontal and axial movement providing letter and line spacing, respectively). The cylindrical platen became [...] "an indispensable part of every standard [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and <b>letter</b> <b>spacing).</b> Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a multi-set {{modulation}} technique to increase the hiding capacity within a binary document image. As part of this technique we propose an Automatic Threshold Calculation and Threshold Buffering, Shifted <b>Space</b> Distribution and <b>Letter</b> <b>Space</b> Compensation technique. The Automatic Threshold Calculation is used to distinguish word <b>spaces</b> from <b>letter</b> <b>spaces.</b> The Threshold Buffering is used to reduce the chance of misinterpretation of spaces during the detection phase, following printing and scanning. The Shifted <b>Space</b> Distribution and <b>Letter</b> <b>Space</b> Compensation techniques robustly embed a watermark into the binary document image. The Automatic Threshold Calculation {{has been shown to be}} successful in identifying word spaces for different types of fonts and font sizes. The combination of the Shifted <b>Space</b> Distribution, <b>Letter</b> <b>Space</b> Compensation and Threshold Buffering techniques have been shown to create a watermark that is robust to printing and scanning. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Along with contour interaction, {{inaccurate}} and imprecise eye {{movements and}} attention {{have been suggested}} to contribute to poorer acuity for “crowded” vs. uncrowded targets. To investigate the role of eye movements in foveal crowding, we compared percent correct letter identification for short and long lines of near-threshold letters with different separations. Methods. Five normal observers read short (4 – 6 letters) and long (10 – 12 letters) lines of nearthreshold, Sloan letters with edge-to-edge letter separations of 0. 5, 1 and 2 <b>letter</b> <b>spaces.</b> Percent correct <b>letter</b> identification for the 2 – 4 interior letters in short strings and the 8 – 10 interior letters in long strings was compared to a no-crowding condition. Results. Letter identification was significantly worse than the no-crowding condition for long letter strings with a separation of 1 <b>letter</b> <b>space,</b> and for both long and short letter strings with a separation of 0. 5 <b>letter</b> <b>spaces.</b> Observers more often reported the incorrect number of letters in long than short letter strings, even for a separation of 2 <b>letter</b> <b>spaces.</b> Similar results were obtained during straight-ahead gaze and while viewing in 30 – 40 deg left gaze, where 2 of the 5 observers exhibited an increase in horizonal fixational instability. Conclusions. We argue that lower percent correct letter identification and more frequent errors in reporting the number of letters in long compared to short letter strings reflect an eyemovement contribution to foveal crowding...|$|R
40|$|Defining inter-letter {{space is}} {{important}} part of typeface designing process. The purpose of defining the <b>letter</b> <b>space</b> is to make them visually equally distant from each other within words, sentences and paragraphs creating an even value of grey, without darker or lighter areas. Different approaches for determining <b>letter</b> <b>space</b> were developed {{in order to facilitate}} this demanding process. Miguel Sousa (2006) and Walter Tracy (2003) proposes their spacing methods and in paper of De Melo Vargas (2007) and our previous work (Banjanin & Nedeljković, 2014) these methods were tested. The problems occur when defining <b>space</b> around <b>letters</b> a, f, g, s, t, z, and S, for which neither Sousa nor Tracy propose any kind of guidelines (except visual). The aim {{of this paper is to}} measure and analyse spacing values for these letters and to see if there is some kind of “formula” or some kind of guidelines which will broaden existing methods in more accurate way.

The Executive model differed in having a multiple escapement mechanism and four widths for characters, allowing it to simulate 12 point 'ragged right' typesetting.
