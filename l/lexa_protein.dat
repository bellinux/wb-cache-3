50|$|<b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> is the {{repressor}} of all cellular din genes. Lesions such as single-stranded DNA, depurinic and depytimidinic {{sites or}} even free deoxynucletoides seem to activate RecA to LexA processing form that facilitates cleavage of LexA repressor, thus leading to derepression of all din genes. RecA protein {{appears to have}} further roles in the mutagenic process: first it facilitates cleavage of UmuD protein, thereby generating a mutagenically active form (UmuD’). Due to {{the participation of the}} umuC in the mutagenic process leading to both point- and frameshift-mutations, only one single bacterial strain is necessary to detect different types of mutagens. Nevertheless, additional strains have been developed in order to increase sensitivity for the detection of genotoxins, belonging to certain classes, such as nitroarenes.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{polymerase}} V (Pol V) is a Y-family DNA polymerase that {{is involved}} in SOS response and translesion synthesis DNA repair mechanisms. Transcription of Pol V via the umuDC genes is highly regulated to produce only Pol V when damaged DNA {{is present in the}} cell generating an SOS response. Stalled polymerases causes RecA to bind to the ssDNA, which causes the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> to autodigest. LexA then loses its ability to repress the transcription of the umuDC operon. The same RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein posttranslationally modifies the UmuD protein into UmuD' protein. UmuD and UmuD' form a heterodimer that interacts with UmuC, which in turn activates umuC's polymerase catalytic activity on damaged DNA. Interestingly, In E. coli, a polymerase “tool belt” model for switching pol III with pol IV at a stalled replication fork, where both polymerases bind simultaneously to the β-clamp, has been proposed. However, the involvement of more than one TLS polymerase working in succession to bypass a lesion has not yet been shown in E. coli. Moreover, Pol IV can catalyze both insertion and extension with high efficiency, whereas pol V is considered the major SOS TLS polymerase. One example is the bypass of intra strand guanine thymine cross-link where it was shown {{on the basis of the}} difference in the mutational signatures of the two polymerases, that pol IV and pol V compete for TLS of the intra-strand crosslink.|$|E
40|$|<b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> is a represssor {{of several}} {{chromosomal}} genes {{involved in the}} SOS response in Escherichia coli. In previous experiments, we found that <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> {{may also be a}} repressor of the colicin El gene. We now present evidence that the purified <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> strongly repressed the in vitro transcription of the colicin El gene. As determined in DNase I protection experiments, <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> bound with a high affinity to the approximately 40 -base pair long sequence between the Pribnow box and the start codon of the colicin El gene. The sequence of the binding site was composed of two overlapped “SOS boxes ” to which the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> bound in a cooperative manner.

40|$|Bacteria {{activate}} {{a regulatory}} network {{in response to}} the challenges imposed by DNA damage to genetic material, known as the SOS response. This system is regulated by the RecA recombinase and by the transcriptional repressor lexA. Leptospira interrogans is a pathogen capable of surviving in the environment for weeks, being exposed to a great variety of stress agents and yet retaining its ability to infect the host. This study aims to investigate the behavior of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni after the stress induced by DNA damage. We show that L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni genome contains two genes encoding putative <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>lexA</b> 1 and lexA 2) one of them being potentially acquired by lateral gene transfer. Both genes are induced after DNA damage, but the steady state levels of both <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins</b> drop, probably due to auto-proteolytic activity triggered in this condition. In addition, seven other genes were up-regulated following UV-C irradiation, recA, recN, dinP, and four genes encoding hypothetical proteins. This set of genes is potentially regulated by LexA 1, as it showed binding to their promoter regions. All these regions contain degenerated sequences in relation to the previously described SOS box, TTTGN 5 CAAA. On the other hand, LexA 2 was able to bind to the palindrome TTGTAN 10 TACAA, found in its own promoter region, but not in the others. Therefore, the L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni SOS regulon may be even more complex, as a result of LexA 1 and LexA 2 binding to divergent motifs. New possibilities for DNA damage response in Leptospira are expected, with potential influence in other biological responses such as virulenc...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotics that {{interfere}} with DNA replication and cell viability activate the SOS response. In Staphylococcus aureus, the antibiotic-induced SOS response promotes replication and high-frequency horizontal transfer of pathogenicity island-encoded virulence factors. Here we report that β-lactams induce a bona fide SOS response in S. aureus, characterized by the activation of the RecA and <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins,</b> the two master regulators of the SOS response. Moreover, we show that β-lactams are capable of triggering staphylococcal prophage induction in S. aureus lysogens. Consequently, and as previously described for SOS induction by commonly used fluoroquinolone antibiotics, β-lactam-mediated phage induction also resulted in replication and high-frequency transfer of the staphylococcal pathogenicity islands, showing that such antibiotics may have the unintended consequence of promoting the spread of bacterial virulence factors...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{experiments}} {{have suggested that}} the lexA gene product of Escherichia coli represses a number of genes involved in the response to DNA damage, including recA and lexA. We purified the lexA gene product from bacterial strains that bear plasmids that direct the synthesis of large amounts of the protein. Purified <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> bound to two symmetrical DNA sequences in front of lexA and one in front of recA, protecting them from digestion with DNase I and blocking methylation of purines in the major groove. <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> repressed transcription of both genes in vitro. <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> binds to the two sites in front of the lexA gene with approximately the same affinity and with greater affinity to the single site in front of the recA gene. The affinity of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> for its operator sites was measured under conditions that mimic conditions in vivo. Differences in the affinity with which <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> binds to the operators of genes it represses may account for the differences in the timing and extent of their induction after DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|Colicin E 1 {{is a small}} plasmid, {{containing}} the cea gene for colicin, the most prominent product of the plasmid. Colicin is a 56 -kilodalton bacteriocin which is especially toxic to Escherichia coli cells that do not contain the plasmid. Under normal growth conditions very low levels of the plasmid are produced {{as a result of}} cea gene repression by the host <b>LexA</b> <b>protein.</b> Conditions that lower the concentration of <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> result in elevated levels of colicin synthesis. The <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> concentration can be lowered by exposing the cells to DNA-damaging reagents such as UV light or mitomycin C. This is because DNA damage signals the host SOS response; the response leads to activation of the RecA protease which degrades the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein.</b> DNA-damaging reagents result in very high levels of colicin synthesis and subsequent death of plasmid-bearing cells. Elevated levels of colicin are also produced in mutants of E. coli that are deficient in <b>LexA</b> <b>protein.</b> We found that comparably high levels of colicin can be produced in such mutants in the absence of cell death. In lexA strains carrying a defective LexA repressor, colicin synthesis shows a strong temperature dependence. Ten to twenty times more colicin is synthesized at 42 degrees C. This sharp dependence of synthesis on temperature suggests that there are factors other than the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> which regulate colicin synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} control region and the presumptive N-terminal portion of the uvrD gene of Escherichia coli K- 12 has been determined. The 1190 base pairs of DNA examined include the likely coding sequence for the first 258 amino acids of the uvrD protein. The transcription promoter for the uvrD gene was identified upstream of the protein coding region. Synthesis of messenger RNA in vitro from this promoter was inhibited by purified <b>lexA</b> <b>protein.</b> The <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> was found to bind downstream from the promoter at a sequence, CTGTATATATACCCAG, which is homologous to other known <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> binding sites. In {{the absence of the}} <b>lexA</b> <b>protein,</b> approximately half of the messages initiated in vitro at the uvrD promoter terminate after about 60 nucleotides at a sequence which resembles a rho-independent terminator. These results indicate that the uvrD gene is induced during the SOS response, and that the expression of the gene may also be regulated by transcription attenuation...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{cellular}} ATP concentration during SOS induction in {{strains of}} Escherichia coli with {{different levels of}} RecA and <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins</b> were studied. UV irradiation of RecA+ strains induced a twofold increase in the ATP concentration around the first 20 min, followed by a decrease {{to the values of}} nonirradiated cells. On the other hand, mutants defective in RecA protein or with either deficient RecA protease activity or cleavage-resistant LexA repressor did not show any decrease, suggesting that ATP consumption is related to LexA repressor hydrolysis. Furthermore, strains presenting a constitutive synthesis of RecA protein showed the same changes in ATP concentration as the wild-type strain. Likewise, the presence in a RecA+ strain of a LexA(Def) protein, which is defective in its capacity for binding specifically to SOS operators, did not disturb the changes in ATP when compared with the LexA+ RecA+ strain. Moreover, after UV irradiation, a LexA(Def) RecA- double mutant showed an important increase in ATP concentration, which remained elevated for at least 120 min after UV treatment...|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli (E. coli) SOS {{response}} is the largest, most complex, and best characterized bacterial network induced by DNA damage. It {{is controlled by}} a complex network involving the RecA and <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins.</b> We have previously shown that the SOS response to DNA damage is inhibited by various elements involved in {{the expression of the}} E. coli toxin-antitoxin mazEF pathway. Since the mazEF module is present on the chromosomes of most E. coli strains, here we asked: Why is the SOS response found in so many E. coli strains? Is the mazEF module present but inactive in those strains? We examined three E. coli strains used for studies of the SOS response, strains AB 1932, BW 25113, and MG 1655. We found that each of these strains is either missing or inhibiting one of several elements involved in the expression of the mazEF-mediated death pathway. Thus, the SOS response only takes place in E. coli cells in which one or more elements of the E. coli toxin-antitoxin module mazEF or its downstream pathway is not functioning...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an affinity column to study the interaction of LexA repressor and other substrates with the activated form of RecA protein. Nucleoprotein complexes of RecA protein, (dT) 25 - 30, and adenosine 5 '-[gamma-S]thio-triphosphate were formed in solution and bound to RecA protein-agarose columns. These "activated"-RecA nucleoprotein complexes were retained by strong hydrophobic interactions. Purified <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> bound tightly to these activated RecA columns, whereas the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> bound poorly to RecA-agarose alone. Once bound, <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> underwent specific proteolysis, and the fragments were released from the complex. The mutant <b>LexA</b> <b>protein,</b> LexA-SA 119, which cannot carry out self-cleavage or RecA-mediated cleavage in solution, bound efficiently to the activated RecA column but was not cleaved, indicating that these columns {{can be used to}} identify residues involved in RecA-LexA binding. As an example of this use, nucleoprotein complexes were prepared using the RecA 430 protein. In vivo the recA 430 mutation blocks induction of the SOS response. <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> was not efficiently retained on the immobilized RecA 430 complexes, suggesting that Gly- 204 is required for efficient repressor binding. These results show that activated RecA affinity columns can be used to investigate the binding and cleaving properties of mutationally altered RecA and LexA proteins. Additionally, these activated RecA columns have been used to investigate binding interactions of phage lambda repressor, as well as the UmuC protein, which is required for chemical mutagenesis...|$|E

40|$|Transcription of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides recA {{promoter}} (PrecA) is induced upon DNA {{damage in}} a lexA-dependent manner. In vivo experiments demonstrate that <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> represses and might also activate transcription of PrecA. Purified R. sphaeroides <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> specifically binds the SOS boxes {{located within the}} PrecA region. In vitro transcription analysis, using Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP), indicated {{that the presence of}} LexA may stimulate and repress transcription of PrecA. EMSA and DNase I footprinting experiments show that LexA and RNAP can bind simultaneously to PrecA. At low LexA concentrations it enhances RNAP binding to PrecA, stimulates open complex formation and strand separation beyond the transcription start site. At high LexA concentrations, however, RNAP-promoted strand separation is not observed beyond the + 5 region. LexA might repress transcription by interfering with the clearance process instead of blocking the access of RNAP to the promoter region. Based on these findings we propose that the R. sphaeroides <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> performs fine tuning of the SOS response, which might provide a physiological advantage by enhancing transcription of SOS genes and delaying full activation of the response...|$|E

50|$|During normal growth, the SOS {{genes are}} {{negatively}} regulated by <b>LexA</b> repressor <b>protein</b> dimers. Under normal conditions, LexA binds to a 20-bp consensus sequence (the SOS box) in the operator region for those genes. Some of these SOS genes are expressed at certain levels {{even in the}} repressed state, according to the affinity of LexA for their SOS box. Activation of the SOS genes occurs after DNA damage by the accumulation of single stranded (ssDNA) regions generated at replication forks, where DNA polymerase is blocked. RecA forms a filament around these ssDNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion, and becomes activated. The activated form of RecA interacts with the LexA repressor to facilitate the LexA repressor's self-cleavage from the operator.|$|R
40|$|The vRel oncoprotein is {{member of}} a family of related {{proteins}} that also includes cRel, NF-kappa B, and Dorsal. We investigated the transcriptional regulatory properties of several Rel proteins in cotransfection assays with chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Retroviral vectors expressing hybrid proteins that contain the DNA-binding domain of LexA fused to portions of the viral oncoprotein vRel or chicken, mouse, human, or Drosophila melanogaster (Dorsal) cRel proteins were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid that contains the DNA sequence recognized by LexA, a promoter, and the assayable gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In transient assays, a LexA-vRel protein did not activate transcription in CEF. Full-length chicken cRel, mouse cRel, and Dorsal fusion proteins all activated transcription weakly; however, deletion of N-terminal Rel sequences from each of these proto-oncogene encoded proteins resulted in strong activation by <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>proteins</b> containing only C-terminal sequences. Inhibition of the C-terminal chicken cRel gene activation domain by N-terminal sequences was seen in CEF and mouse and monkey fibroblasts. These results show that cRel proteins from different species have the same general organization: an N-terminal inhibitory domain and a C-terminal activation domain. Sequence comparison suggests that the inhibitory domain is conserved but the activation domain is species specific. In contrast, vRel lacks a strong C-terminal gene activation function, since a <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>protein</b> containing C-terminal vRel sequences alone only weakly activated transcription. In addition, the wild-type vRel <b>protein</b> (lacking <b>LexA</b> sequences) repressed transcription from reporter plasmids containing NF-kappa B target sequences; nontransforming vRel mutants did not repress transcription from these plasmids. Our results suggest that vRel transforms cells by interfering with transcriptional activation by cellular Rel proteins...|$|R
40|$|The <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> in E. coli is a {{specific}} repressor of the recA gene. The <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> is cleaved by the recA protein in response to DNA damage. Cleavage derepresses the recA gene resulting in high level synthesis of recA protein and the expression of other DNA damage inducible functions (SOS functions). The lexA 3 mutation makes the <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> resistant to cleavage and thus inhibits expression of DNA damage inducible functions. A mutant of E. coli has been isolated which exhibits many of the properties expected of a strain carrying an operator-constitutive mutation in the recA gene. The mutation partially suppresses the UV sensitivity of lexA 3 strains, maps near the recA structural gene, allows constitutive synthesis of the recA protein and the recA message, and is cis-acting. Strains carrying the recAo('c) mutation were used to study the role of amplified levels of recA protein in the expression of certain SOS functions. The recAo('c) mutation did not suppress the UV inhibitory effect of the lexA 3 mutation on the expression of UV induced cellular mutagenesis, and the reactivation and mutagenesis of UV irradiated phage (lamda). The expression of these functions in lexA('+) strains was not enhanced by the recAo('c) mutation. Constitutive recA synthesis {{did not result in}} lethal filamentous growth. These results are consistent with those reported elsewhere that the expression of SOS function is not dependent on high levels of recA protein and that the various "SOS genes" are repressed by the <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> as is the recA gene. Thus, recA protein is required in SOS expression for the inactivation of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> and recA amplification is a consequence, not a cause of SOS expression. The DNA sequence of the recA operator region from a (lamda) precA transducing phage thought to carry the recAo('c) mutation isolated here, was determined. No difference was detected between the supposed mutant DNA and wild type controls. The significance of these results and the possibility that the recAo('c) mutation was not transferred to the phage are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{expression}} of the colicin Ib gene of the I 1 group plasmid TP 110 has been investigated. The colicin promoter was fused to the structural gene for beta-galactosidase, using the Mu d(Aprlac) phage, and the plasmid carrying this fusion was introduced {{into a variety of}} bacterial strains defective in genes involved in the "SOS" response. Colicin Ib belongs to that group of genes directly controlled by the repressor produced by the lexA gene, and expression was inducible by DNA-damaging agents. Mutations in uvrA, -B, and -C reduced the efficiency of induction by mitomycin C, as did mutations in recB. Mutations in recA and recF effectively prevented induction by mitomycin C, whereas mutations in lexA had contrasting effects, depending upon their effect on the properties of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein.</b> The spr- 51 mutation (which inactivates <b>lexA</b> <b>protein)</b> led to constitutive expression, whereas the lexA 3 mutation (which makes <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> refractory to cleavage by recA protein) completely inhibited inducible expression. In addition to lexA control, a TP 110 -coded function was identified which appeared able to inhibit colicin expression when the gene responsible was present in high copy number...|$|E
40|$|The <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> of Escherichia coli represses {{expression}} {{of a variety of}} genes that, by definition, constitute the SOS regulon. Genetic evidence suggests that Tn 5 transposition is also regulated by the product of the lexA gene (C. -T. Kuan, S. -K. Liu, and I. Tessman, Genetics 128 : 45 - 57, 1991). We now show that the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> represses {{expression of}} the tnp gene, located in the IS 50 R component of Tn 5, which encodes a transposase, and that LexA does not repress expression of the IS 50 R inh gene, which encodes an inhibitor of transposition. Elimination of LexA resulted in increased expression of the tnp gene by a factor of 2. 7 +/- 0. 4, as indicated by the activity of a lacZ gene fused to the tnp gene. <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> retarded the electrophoretic movement of a 101 -bp segment of IS 50 R DNA that contained a putative LexA protein-binding site in the tnp promoter; the interaction between the LexA repressor and the promoter region of the tnp gene appears to be relatively weak.

Using bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) as a model for examining interactions between E 1 and E 2, we have used the two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion systems to map domains of BPV- 1 E 1 and E 2 that interact in vivo and in vitro. In the two-hybrid system experiments, portions of BPV- 1 E 2 were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>proteins,</b> which were tested for interaction with various domains of BPV- 1 E 1. These assays indicated that domains sufficient for E 1 -E 2 interaction are present within the amino-terminal 250 amino acids of E 1 and within the first 91 amino acids of E 2. Interestingly, a <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>protein</b> that included amino acid residues 53 to 161 of BPV E 2 demonstrated transcriptional activation in this system. In vitro binding assays using combinations of BPV- 1 E 1 -GST fusion proteins and BPV- 1 E 2 expressed by in vitro translation confirmed the observations from the yeast system; a GST fusion protein containing the first 222 amino acids of BPV- 1 E 1 bound specifically to full-length BPV- 1 E 2 in vitro. Furthermore, E 1 (1 - 222) -GST bound to forms of E 2 deleted of the carboxy-terminal DNA binding-dimerization domain, suggesting that E 2 dimerization is not required for this interaction. Finally, in vitro interaction between E 1 -GST and E 2 was observed at 22 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified and}} characterized a lexA gene from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri. For this study, we cloned and expressed a lexA homologue from X. axonopodis pv. citri. This gene was designated lexA 2, and the previously identified lexA gene was renamed lexA 1. The coding region of lexA 2 is 606 bp long and shares 59 % nucleotide sequence identity with lexA 1. Analyses of the deduced {{amino acid sequence}} revealed that LexA 2 has structures that are characteristic of <b>LexA</b> <b>proteins,</b> including a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and conserved amino acid residues required for the autocleavage of LexA. The lexA 2 mutant, which was constructed by gene replacement, was 4 orders of magnitude more resistant to the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C at 0. 1 μg/ml and 1 order of magnitude more resistant to another DNA-damaging agent, methylmethane sulfonate at 30 μg/ml, than the wild type. A lexA 1 lexA 2 double mutant had {{the same degree of}} susceptibility to mitomycin C as the lexA 1 or lexA 2 single mutant but was 1 order of magnitude more resistant to methylmethane sulfonate at 30 μg/ml than the lexA 1 or lexA 2 single mutant. These results suggest that LexA 1 and LexA 2 play different roles in regulating the production of methyltransferases that are required for repairing DNA damage caused by methylmethane sulfonate. A mitomycin C treatment also caused LexA 2 to undergo autocleavage, as seen with LexA 1. The results of electrophoresis mobility shift assays revealed that LexA 2 does not bind the lexA 1 promoter. It binds to both the lexA 2 and recA promoters. However, neither LexA 2 nor LexA 1 appears to regulate recA expression, as lexA 1, lexA 2, and lexA 1 lexA 2 mutants did not become constitutive for recA transcription and RecA production. These results suggest that recA expression in X. axonopodis pv. citri is regulated by mechanisms that have yet to be identified...|$|R

40|$|The recA and lexA {{proteins}} of EScherichia coli {{are involved}} in a complex regulatory circuit that allows the expression of a diverse set of functions after DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication. Exponentially growing cells contain a low level of recA protein, and genetic evidence suggests that <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> is involved in its regulation, perhaps as a simple repressor. Recent models for recA derepression after DNA damage have suggested that an early event in this process is the proteolytic cleavage of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein,</b> leading to high-level expression of recA. We present several lines of evidence that the specific protease activity of the recA protein, previously described with the lambda repressor as substrate, is capable of cleaving the wild-type lexA+ protein. First, <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> can be cleaved in vitro under the same conditions as prevously described for lambda repressor cleavage in a reaction requring both recA protease and ATP or an analogue, adenosine 5 '-[lambda-thio]-triphosphate. Second, <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> can be observed in vivo as a physical entity after infection with lambda lexA+ transducing phage of host strains containing ittle or no active protease, but not in strains containing high levels of active protease. Finally, infection of host cells containing active protease with a lambda lexA+ transducing phage does not lead to repression of recA, but does so in cells lacking active protease. In all of these conditions the mutant lexA 3 protein is largely resistant to inactivation or cleavage; this resistance can explain the dominant phenotype of lexA 3 over lexA+. We discuss models for recA derepression and re-establishment of repression which propose that modulation of the protease activity of recA protein regulates both of these transitions...|$|E
40|$|When the DNA of Escherichia coli {{is damaged}} {{a set of}} events termed "SOS functions" occur to aid {{cellular}} survival.

To determine the role of the <b>lexA</b> <b>protein,</b> amber mutations, designated spr- 55 (amber), were isolated in the lexA- 3 gene. The lack of the lexA- 3 gene product abolished sensitivity to ultraviolet light and resulted in the constitutive synthesis of recA protein. Introduction of amber suppressor mutations restored the original lexA- 3 phenotype. It was concluded that spr mutations inactivate <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> resulting in the constitutive expression of the SOS functions. These data provide evidence that the <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> is the repressor for the recA gene. The repair of phage lambda (λ⁺) by ultraviolet light was determined in the strains carrying alleles of the spr, uvrA, and recA genes. The survival of the phage was more in the spr- 51 uvrA⁺ strain as compared to wild type. These results were not dependent on the recA genotype. Introduction of the uvrA- 6 mutation into the spr- 51 uvrA⁺ recA⁺ strains resulted in the same relative decrease of phage survival. These results suggest that <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> is involved in the regulation of uvrA-dependent excision repair and that inactivation of lexA leads to the constitutive expression of excision repair. New mutant forms of lexaA protein were isolated. The lexA⁺, lexA- 3, lexA- 10, and lexA- 27 proteins displayed identical mobilities in the Weber and Osborn gel system. The lexA- 10 and lexA- 27 genes showed different phenotypes and encoded proteins of different mobilities in the Laemmli gel system.

40|$|Proteolytic {{cleavage}} of lexA repressor is {{an early}} step in derepression of the SOS regulatory system of Escherichia coli. In vivo and in vitro data have indicated a role for recA protein in this specific proteolytic reaction. I show here that, under certain conditions, specific in vitro cleavage of highly-purified <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> can {{take place in the}} absence of recA protein. This autodigestion reaction cleaved the same alanine-glycine bond as did the recA-dependent cleavage reaction. Several lines of evidence argued that it was not due to a contaminating protease activity. Autodigestion was stimulated by alkaline pH. It occurred in the presence of EDTA but was stimulated several fold by the presence of Ca 2 +, Co 2 +, or Mg 2 +. The reaction appeared to be first-order, and its rate was independent of protein concentration over a wide range, strongly suggesting that it is intramolecular. Purified phage lambda repressor also broke down under similar conditions to yield products like those resulting from recA protein action. Phage lambda repressor broke down at a far slower rate than did lexA, as previously observed in the recA-catalyzed in vitro reaction and in vivo. This correlation between the two types of cleavage also extended to the reactions with mutant repressor proteins; taken together with the site specificity, it suggests that autodigestion and recA-dependent cleavage follow, at least in part, a similar reaction pathway. These findings indicate that specific cleavage of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> can be catalyzed by the protein itself and suggest that recA protein plays an indirect stimulatory role, perhaps as an allosteric effector, in the recA-dependent reaction, rather than acting directly as a protease. The protease active site and the recA-recognition site lie in the central or COOH-terminal portion of the <b>lexA</b> <b>protein,</b> since a tryptic fragment containing these portions of <b>lexA</b> <b>protein</b> could take part in both reactions...|$|E
40|$|LexA {{repressor}} of Escherichia coli is inactivated by {{a specific}} cleavage reaction that requires activated RecA protein in vivo. This cleavage reaction can proceed in vitro {{in the presence}} of activated RecA or as an intramolecular RecA-independent reaction, termed autodigestion, that is stimulated by alkaline pH. Here we describe a set of <b>LexA</b> mutant <b>proteins</b> that undergo a greatly increased rate of specific cleavage in vivo, compared with wild-type LexA. Efficient in vivo cleavage of these mutant proteins also took place without RecA. Several lines of evidence suggest that cleavage occurred via a mechanism similar to autodigestion. These mutations changed Gln- 92, which lies near the cleavage site, to tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan. The latter mutation increased the rate of cleavage approximately 500 -fold. These findings imply that the rate of wild-type LexA cleavage has been optimized during evolution to make the SOS system properly responsive to DNA-damaging treatments. Availability of these mutants will aid in the understanding of rate-limiting steps in intramolecular reactions...|$|R
40|$|Affinity tagging {{has been}} used in many global studies towards protein function. We {{describe}} a highly efficient system for in vivo biotinylation of transcription factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is based on the bacterial BirA biotin ligase. The strength of the biotin–streptavidin interaction was exploited to improve detection of in vivo protein–DNA complexes in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In a test system using the biotin-tagged <b>LexA</b> DNA-binding <b>protein,</b> we found that stringent washing conditions resulted in a strong improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios. Yeast strains with chromosomally integrated versions of tagged transcription factor genes were generated using N- or C-terminal biotin-tagging cassettes. ChIP experiments with biotinylated Rbp 3 p, a RNA polymerase II subunit, showed that Rbp 3 p-binding could even be detected at weakly expressed genes. Other methods failed to detect RNA polymerase II binding at such genes. Our results show that biotinylation of yeast transcription factors improves the detection of in vivo protein–DNA complexes...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II holoenzymes {{respond to}} activators and repressors that are regulated by signaling pathways. Here we present {{evidence for a}} “shortcut” mechanism in which the Snf 1 protein kinase of the glucose signaling pathway directly regulates transcription by the yeast holoenzyme. In response to glucose limitation, the Snf 1 kinase stimulates transcription by holoenzyme that has been artificially recruited to a reporter by a LexA fusion to a holoenzyme component. We show that Snf 1 interacts physically with the Srb/mediator proteins of the holoenzyme in both two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. We also show that a catalytically hyperactive Snf 1, when bound to a promoter as a <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>protein,</b> activates transcription in a glucose-regulated manner; moreover, this activation depends on {{the integrity of the}} Srb/mediator complex. These results suggest that direct regulatory interactions between signal transduction pathways and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme provide a mechanism for transcriptional control in response to important signals...|$|R
40|$|Two genetic {{approaches}} {{were taken}} to define the DNA binding domain of <b>LexA</b> <b>protein,</b> the repressor of the Escherichia coli SOS regulon. First, several dominant negative lexA mutants defective in DNA binding were isolated. The mutations altered amino acids in a region similar to the helix-turn-helix, a DNA binding domain of other repressors and DNA binding proteins. Second, the region encoding the predicted DNA recognition helix was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and mutant LexA proteins with altered or relaxed specificity for several recA operator positions were isolated. By examining {{the effects of a}} series of amino acid substitutions on repressor specificity, it was shown that a glutamic acid residue at position 45 in <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> is important for recognition of the first base pair (G. C) in the recA operator...|$|E

Surprisingly, lexA null mutations in Salmonella enterica are lethal {{even with a}} sulA mutation, which corrects lexA lethality in E. coli. Nine suppressors of lethality isolated in a sulA mutant of S. enterica ha...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fluorescence}} of the <b>LexA</b> <b>protein,</b> {{the common}} repressor of the SOS system in Escherichia coli decreases by about 30 % upon incubation with the Ree A protein, and its cofactors ATP [or its non-hydroly sable analogue adenosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate), ATPγS] Mg 2 + and single-stranded DNA. In {{the absence of}} any one of these elements required for the RecA-dependent proteolysis of LexA, this fluorescence change was not observed. The final fluorescence change depends only upon the concentration of LexA regardless of that of RecA. The time course of the fluorescence decrease corresponds well with the kinetics of the decrease of intact <b>LexA</b> <b>protein</b> and the increase of its 2 proteolytic fragments as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results allow us to use the fluorescence change as a signal for a detailed kinetic analysis. The velocity of the proteolysis (d[LexA]/dt) is proportional to the concentration of LexA and RecA indicating that the formation of the LexA-RecA complex is the limiting step...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{control of}} gene {{expression}} {{is essential in}} basic biological research {{as well as in}} biotechnolog-ical applications. Most regulated systems available in yeast enable only the overexpression of the tar-get gene, excluding the possibility of intermediate or weak expression. Moreover, these systems are fre-quently toxic or depend on growth conditions. We constructed a heterologous transcription factor that overcomes these limitations. Our system is a fusion of the bacterial <b>LexA</b> DNA-binding <b>protein,</b> the hu-man estrogen receptor (ER) and an activation domain (AD). The activity of this chimera, called LexA-ER-AD, is tightly regulated by the hormone -estradiol. The selection of the AD proved to be crucial to avoid toxic effects and to define the range of activity that can be precisely tuned with -estradiol. As our sys-tem is based on a heterologous DNA-binding domain, induction in different metabolic contexts is possi-ble. Additionally, by controlling the number of LexA-binding sites in the target promoter, one can scale the expression levels up or down. Overall, our LexA-ER-AD system is a valuable tool to precisely control gene expression in different experimental contexts without toxic side effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 14 - 3 - 3 {{proteins}} are a {{group of}} highly conserved and widely distributed eukaryotic proteins with diverse functions. One 14 - 3 - 3 protein, AFT 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, {{was found to be}} able to activate transcription in yeast. When fused to the DNA-binding domain of a bacterial <b>protein</b> <b>LexA,</b> AFT 1 can activate transcription of reporter genes that contain LexA operator sequences in their promoters. Although the in vivo function of AFT 1 is not completely known, its similarity to previously identified proteins found in transcription complexes of Arabidopsis and maize suggests that AFT 1 and some other 14 - 3 - 3 proteins may activate gene expression in other systems as well...|$|R
40|$|A yeast mutant was {{isolated}} encoding a single amino acid substitution [serine- 53 → proline (S 53 P) ] in transcription factor TFIIB that impairs {{activation of the}} PHO 5 gene in response to phosphate starvation. This effect is activation-specific because S 53 P {{did not affect the}} uninduced level of PHO 5 expression, yet is not specific to PHO 5 because Adr 1 -mediated activation of the ADH 2 gene also was impaired by S 53 P. Pho 4, the principal activator of PHO 5, directly interacted with TFIIB in vitro, and this interaction was impaired by the S 53 P replacement. Furthermore, Pho 4 induced a conformational change in TFIIB, detected by enhanced sensitivity to V 8 protease. The S 53 P replacement also impaired activation of a lexA(op) -lacZ reporter by a <b>LexA</b> fusion <b>protein</b> to the activation domain of Adr 1, thereby indicating that the transcriptional effect on ADH 2 expression is specific to the activation function of Adr 1. These results define an activation-specific role for TFIIB in vivo and suggest that certain activators induce a conformational change in TFIIB as part of their mechanism of transcriptional stimulation...|$|R
