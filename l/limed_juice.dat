50|$|Sugar {{cane juice}} has a pH of about 4.0 to 4.5 {{which is quite}} acidic. Calcium hydroxide, also known as Milk of lime or limewater, {{is added to the}} cane juice to adjust its pH to 7. The lime helps to prevent sucrose's decay into glucose and fructose. The <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> is then heated to a {{temperature}} above its boiling point. The superheated <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> is then allowed to flash to its saturation temperature: this process precipitates impurities which get held up in the calcium carbonate crystals. The flashed juice is then transferred to a clarification tank which allows the suspended solids to settle. The supernatant, known as clear juice is drawn off of the clarifier and sent to the evaporators.|$|E
40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} contents {{present in}} various diffusion juices such as no <b>limed</b> <b>juice,</b> <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> and juice from limed sugar cane, were 0. 4, 0. 4 and 1. 6 grams per liter of juice, respectively. More than 80 % of the polysaccharides from these juices were obtained as water soluble fraction. The polysaccharides from no <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> contained hemicelluloses which were predominantly composed of galactose, glucose and arabinose. The polysaccharides from limed cane also contained α-glucan {{in addition to}} hemicelluloses. This glucan in <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> was not so remarkable as in limed cane. Separation of hemicelluloses by gel filtration was not successful...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} step in the processing of sugar is the clarification of the sugarcane juice obtained after milling. In practice, the juice is limed so as to produce coagulated suspensions, these settle slowly and it requires {{a fair amount of}} time to thicken. Therefore, common practice that natural or synthetic flocculants (or clarifying aids) are added to the <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> in order to improve settling and compaction of the coagulates, but the use of synthetic flocculant is not permitted in the production of organic food and organic sugar, as only lime can be utilized. In the manufacture of khandsari and gur the cane juice is clarified using the mucilage of plants such as Hibiscus vitifolius, Aloe vera, etc. The present work made an attempt to assess the effect natural flocculants viz Hibiscus vitifolius, Aloe vera on sugarcane varieties selected in Mandya region and results reveals that the natural flocculants have shown good results over the existing commercial flocculant but natural flocculants requires less settling time and turbidity of the clarified juice when compared to commercial flocculant. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} factory {{trial was}} conducted at the Eston mill (Illovo Sugar Ltd factory) to test {{the ability of the}} Indion 1951 colour precipitant to decrease the colour of sugarcane juice and ultimately raw sugar. The precipitant was dosed on <b>limed</b> mixed <b>juice</b> and into the SRI clarifier, alongside the settling flocculant. The trial showed that, with a dosage of approximately 7 mg/kg decolourant (on sample), the sugar colour reduced from about 1700 ICUMSA Units (IU) to approximately 1300 IU. The colour further decreased to 1100 IU when the dosage was increased to 10 mg/kg. With the 7 mg/kg dosage, the wash time on the A-centrifugals was reduced from ten to four seconds. The Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) was approached to perform an independent evaluation of the colour precipitant. Batch settling tests were performed to determine the optimum dosage of settling flocculant and decolourant on juice collected from the Maidstone mill (Tongaat Hulett Sugar factory). The SMRI’s pilot equipment was then used to obtain sugar from treated and untreated mixed juice. Additional 56 % colour and 57 % turbidity reductions were noted across the pilot clarifier when 10 mg/kg decolourant was used compared to no decolourant being used. The unwashed sugars obtained from prolonged centrifuging were found to have colours of 14 100 and 2100 IU for the untreated and treated streams, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSorghum stalk juice {{preparation}} method {{is not yet}} fully explored and mainly still adopting those of cane juice. The suitability of pre-treatment to remove impurities and total phenolic compound to {{the growth rate of}} yeast in sorghum stalk juice, in aerobic and anaerobic fermentation needs to be evaluated. Process adopted for this research was liming method at 80 oC followed by addition of phosphoric acid. <b>Liming</b> method reduces <b>juice</b> turbidity to 82. 43 % ± 0. 50 % and gives specific growth rate (μ) of inoculated yeast of 0. 38 h– 1 (aerobic) and 0. 17 h– 1 (anaerobic). Other method evaluated was by addition of Poly-aluminium chloride (PAC), which gives higher juice clarity but negative impact to cell growth. The effect of total phenolic compound to the microbial growth was also studied. Phenolic compound was reduced through activated carbon absorption column. Reduction of 75 % total phenolic compound in sorghum stalk juice promotes yeast cell growth rate up to 10. 5 % in aerobic condition compared to growth in clarified juice without phenolic compound reduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of Moringa oleifera Lam. leaf extract on the sedimentation of impurities in the treatment of sugarcane juice and the effects on sugar quality and on the clarified juice. The experimental design used was a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement with four replications. The main treatments performed included the extracted original sugarcane juice, the synthetic polyelectrolyte (Flomex 9076), the leaf extract, and a control. The secondary treatments consisted of the sugarcane varieties RB 92579 and RB 867515. The clarification process used was simple defecation, in which the flocculating agents and the <b>juice,</b> <b>limed</b> and heated, were poured simultaneously into a decanter. The microbiological and chemico-technological characteristics of the extracted and clarified juices were evaluated. The clarified juice was concentrated up to 60 ° Brix (syrup) and subjected to boiling in a pilot pan using seeds to perform the graining: The sugar was recovered by centrifugation and analyzed for microbiological and chemico-technological characteristics. It was concluded that the use of the Moringa oleifera Lam. leaves extract resulted in a better quality of clarified juice and sugar...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of juice expressed from whole green sugarcane crop (stalk and trash) leads to poor clarification performance, reduced sugar yield and poor raw sugar quality. The cause of these adverse effects {{is linked to}} the disproportionate contribution of impurities from the trash component of the crop. This paper reports on the zeta (?) potential, average size distribution (d 50) and fractal dimension (Df) of <b>limed</b> <b>juice</b> particles derived from various juice types using laser diffraction and dynamic light scattering techniques. The influence of non-sucrose impurities on the interactive energy contributions between sugarcane juice particles was examined on the basis of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Results from these investigations have provided evidence (in terms of particle stability) on why juice particles derived from whole green sugarcane crop are relatively difficult to coagulate (and flocculate). The presence of trash reduces the van der Waals forces of attraction between particles, thereby reducing coagulation and flocculation processes. It is anticipated that further fundamental work will lead to strategies that could be adopted for clarifying juices expressed from whole green sugarcane crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of sugarcane juice treatment using Moringa oleifera leaf and seeds extracts on ethanolic fermentation. The experiment was arranged in a split plot statistical design, with four replications. Main treatments were three sedimentation agents (synthetic polyelectrolyte, moringa leaf and seed extracts) and control while the secondary treatments were two sugarcane varieties (RB 867515 and CTC 4). Extracted sugarcane juice was clarified by simple defecation with pH adjusted to 6. 0. The flocculating agents were added in a decanter before the <b>limed</b> <b>juice.</b> After then, the juice was standardized to 16 ° Brix at pH 4. 5, and musts were inoculated with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, FT 858. At the end of the fermentation process, wines were recovered by centrifugation. In all experimental stages, extracted juice, clarified juice and wine were chemically and technologically characterized. The use of moringa leaf and seed extracts as sedimentation adjuvants did not increase the sedimentation speed of impurities. However, there was a high sludge compaction, which was essential for maintenance of yeast and bud population at the beginning of fermentation, and yeast budding rate in the end. The use of different sedimentation agents as adjuvants in juice treatment did not affect wine quality and ethanol yield...|$|E
40|$|Processing {{of juice}} {{expressed}} from green sugar cane containing all the trash (i. e., tops and leaves, the nonstalk component) {{of the sugar}} cane plant during sugar manufacture {{has been reported to}} lead to poor clarified juice (CJ) quality. Studies of different liming techniques have been conducted to identify which liming technique gives the best clarification performance from juice expressed from green cane containing half of all trash extracted (GE). Results have shown that lime saccharate addition to juice at 76 °C either continuous or batchwise gives satisfactory settling rates of calcium phosphate flocs(50 − 70 cm/min) and CJ with low turbidity and minimal amounts of mineral constituents. Surprisingly, the addition of phosphoric acid (≤ 300 mg/kg as P 2 O 5), prior to <b>liming</b> to reduce <b>juice</b> turbidity (≤ 80 %), increased the Mg (≤ 101 %) and Si(≤ 148 %) contents particularly for clarified GE juices. The increase was not proportional with increasing phosphoric acid dose. The nature of the flocs formed, including the zeta potential of the particles by the different liming techniques, has been used to account for the differences in clarification performance. Differences between the qualities of the CJ obtained with GE juice and that of burnt cane juices with all trash extracted (BE) have been discussed to provide further insights into GE processing...|$|R
