[...] It was proven that laser welding is not only feasible in shipbuilding; it is the future of welding in shipbuilding. A proprietary special laser processing tool, FLO (Flexibible Laser Optic), was developed for this application that enables rapid two dimensional scanning and auto focus using a variety of laser sources with output powers up to 15 kW. Welding of thick plates with variable weld seam width was achieved, successfully overcoming the gap and tight tolerance fit-up issues. This is a particular breakthrough as the barriers to effective laser welding implementation in shipbuilding are formidable. The same laser processing tool was also successfully applied in the automotive industry for 3-D robotic remote welding. The process achieved 250 welded spots per minute with 6 kW of laser power.|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have found the welding of superduplex stainless steel UNS S 32760 (Zeron 100) by high power CO 2 laser to be an unacceptable process, because the austenite/ferrite (γ/α) ratio in the <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> bead normally deviates significantly from the optimum balance of 50 : 50. To date, the best γ/α ratio in a <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> reported in the published literature was ∼ 30 : 70. The high percentage of ferrite would result in lower strength and poor corrosion properties. The present investigation was aimed at achieving a near 50 : 50 γ/α ratio <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> using the Nd-YAG laser. These lasers have more process parameters that can be varied, compared to CO 2 lasers. Three different kinds of output power waveform, continuous, sine, and square waves, together with many other parameters, were investigated. The Taguchi method was used for parameter design, {{to reduce the number}} of experiments. Based on the Taguchi approach, optimum process parameters were determined and <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> beads that consisted of 55 : 45 γ/α were achieved.

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{of steel}} 316 L sheets is {{considered}} {{and the effects}} of laser welding parameters on the <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> quality and metallurgical changes in the weld section are presented. The <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> quality is assessed through careful examination of weld geometrical features, and the resulting weld microstructure. Metallurgical changes in the weld sites are examined using optical, and electron scanning microscope (SEM). Two levels of heat inputs are used- 1500 W and 2000 W; and two scanning speeds of 2 cm/s and 4 cm/s are used to <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> 316 L sheets. It is found that at the high laser power intensities, evaporation takes place in the irradiated region and as the laser power intensity increases further, a cavity is formed at the top surface of the welding cross section. A similar situation is also observed as the laser scanning speed reduces. The low diffusivity of the alloying elements at high temperatures preserves the segregation profile.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} system using electromagnetic acoustic transducers {{has been developed}} at the Fraunhofer Institute for Non-Destructive Testing (IZFP), {{in order to test}} laser welds in tailored blanks. Shear horizontal modes are exploited to detect different types of defects in the laser welds, such as lack of penetration, lack of fusion, mismatch and cracks. In the present work, studies of the discontinuities of the <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> that affect specularly reflected and non-specularly signals have been carried out on ferritic sheets.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness in an elastic-plastic material {{joined by a}} <b>laser</b> <b>weld</b> is analyzed for steady-state crack growth along the weld. The analysis is performed for laser welds in steel. Laser welding gives high mismatch between the yield stress within the weld {{and that in the}} base material, due to the fast thermic cycle that the material undergoes in welding. The material is described by J 2 -flow theory, and the analysis is performed using a special numerical algorithm, in which the finite element mesh remains fixed relative to the tip of the growing crack, so that the material moves through the mesh. Fracture is modelled by using a cohesive zone criterion in front of the crack tip along the fracture zone.
