5|$|Ocean Village Marina was {{formerly}} Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina {{had been sold}} to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners. After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} cutbacks inevitably {{had major}} implications for Gibraltar's economy, which had {{up to that}} point depended largely on defence expenditure. It prompted the territory's government to shift its economic orientation and place a much greater emphasis on encouraging tourism and establishing self-sufficiency. Tourism in Gibraltar was encouraged through refurbishing and pedestrianising key areas of the city, building a new passenger terminal to welcome cruise ship visitors and opening new marinas and <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities.</b> By 2011, Gibraltar was attracting over 10 million visitors a year compared to a population of 29,752, giving it one of the highest tourist-to-resident ratios in the world.|$|E
5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities,</b> and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2012, Knight Frank {{announced}} that administrators Ernst & Young had entered into an exclusive agreement with Malaysian developers SP Setia and Sime Darby, {{who were given}} 28 days to conduct due diligence and agree the final terms of the deal. Completion of the sale to the Malaysian consortium took place in September 2012. The redevelopment of the site will use the existing Vinoly master plan which intends to position the Power Station as the central focus of the regenerated 40-acre site, housing a blend of shops, cafes, restaurants, art and <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities,</b> office space and residential accommodation. The plan includes {{the restoration of the}} historic Power Station itself, {{the creation of a new}} riverside park to the north of the Power Station and the creation of a new High Street which is designed to link the future entrance to Battersea Power Station tube station with the Power Station. The redevelopment is hoped to bring about the extension of the existing riverside walk and facilitate access directly from the Power Station to Battersea Park and Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities</b> {{include the}} Keelman's Way, a 14-mile {{designated}} cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal {{from the various}} collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at Felling Shore, at Green Lane, is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally, {{and there are a}} wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities.</b> The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} literature on family leisure {{has been dominated}} by the views of participants in family leisure activities, so {{the purpose of this study}} was to give <b>leisure</b> <b>facility</b> managers an opportunity to reflect on the issue of family leisure from a provider perspective to address the imbalance. <b>Leisure</b> <b>facility</b> managers operating in different areas of leisure provision play a pivotal role in enacting leisure policy into a range of leisure programmes and activities for families. Their opinions and knowledge concerning family leisure needs are significant, as they help shape and determine the nature of family leisure provision in the facilities they manage. The literature review on which this study is based identified five key areas of research in family leisure (concept of leisure, constraints, parenting, work–life balance and dualities of family leisure). As a result of the interviews with <b>leisure</b> <b>facility</b> managers, six key themes emerged (concept, constraints, empathy, customers/community, family friendly and design). In concluding, suggestions are made based on the feedback given by <b>leisure</b> <b>facility</b> managers to effect change and enhance leisure provision for families and recommendations for new avenues of research in family leisure are given...|$|R

5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities.</b> They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.|$|E
5|$|The town lies on {{the ancient}} Watling Street, but is not {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book.

Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and <b>leisure</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
