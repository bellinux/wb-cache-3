50|$|Bubblers {{also have}} <b>limited</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates. To {{increase}} the delivery rate, the carrier gas flows {{need to be}} increased, slowing the diffusion of water vapor to the surface. The water cannot be heated near boiling or uncontrolled flow will result. If the flow rate exceeds a limited velocity, bubbles force the source liquid out of the vessel and into the downstream piping, in turn forcing the use of phase separators, which leads to increased particulate, condensation, and flow instability. Long term use of bubblers typically results in fouling if the water is not frequently changed. The effect of bubbling oxygen through clean water and kept warm by heating and incident IR leads to ideal conditions for growing bacteria. This leads to organic contamination in the film.|$|E
50|$|On February 17, 2012, Corbett signed The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950). The law {{subjected}} {{natural gas}} drillers to an impact fee to offset any environmental or community impacts of drilling. In 2012, the law generated over $200 million for Pennsylvania municipalities, twice the estimated amount of an extraction tax. The law also changed the zoning laws applicable to Marcellus Shale well drilling, more {{commonly known as}} hydraulic fracturing. Some provisions are that all municipalities must allow Marcellus Shale well drilling in all zoning districts, including residential and municipalities may not limit hours of operation. Water and wastewater pits must also be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. Compressor stations must be allowed in industrial and agricultural zoning districts and towns may not limit hours of operation. Gas processing plants are allowed in industrial zoning districts and hours of operation cannot be <b>limited.</b> <b>Gas</b> pipelines must be allowed in all zoning districts, including residential. The law helped gain access to land for new pipelines, one of which transports natural gas from Pennsylvania to export terminals in Maryland, from which it will be shipped to Europe and Asia. Others contend that the pipeline's purpose is to transport the gas to Maryland and D.C. markets. There were concerns that exporting natural gas will result in more jobs going overseas, leading to increased unemployment in Pennsylvania and other states as gas prices rise globally.|$|E
