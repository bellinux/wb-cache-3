40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} a new color pediatric visual acuity chart and its clinical application. METHODS:The color pediatric visual acuity chart was designed based on principle of visual angle. The optotype on the color chart had graphics. The progression rate of optotype size between 2 lines was 10 (10) 1 / 2 and 1. 2589. A regular geometric progression of optotype sizes and distribution was employed to arrange 8 lines with 11 optotype on the color chart. The testing distance was 3 m. The visual acuity score could be recorded as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution notation or decimal notation. The reliability of naked distant measurements with this new chart was tested in one eye of 100 children(4 ～ 6 years old) taking the Chinese national standard logarithm visual acuity chart standard. RESULTS: The color pediatric visual acuity chart and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>chart</b> controls, visual acuity test results that {{in the two groups}} had no significant difference(t = 1. 2671, P > 0. 05). Two sets of vision data existed positive correlation(r = 0. 924, P CONCLUSION:Children are easier to accept used new color pediatric visual acuity chart to inspect vision.

40|$|Though it is {{well known}} that some aquatic animals can swim at higher speed than the value {{estimated}} from both of the muscle power and the friction drag received from the stream around the animal, the reason of such a high speed propulsion seems not yet to be solved. In this study, first, the swimming abilities of the various swimmers involving small fishes, dolphins, whales and a manmade submarine for reference were rearranged in a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>chart</b> and the subject of the problem was settled quantitatively. Then, measurements of drag force of some fishes by a towing type instrument with strain guage and observations of the swimming motion of fishes by a high speed camera were carried out in the water channel of laboratory. According to the experimental results, there is no evidence of that the skin friction of fish is smaller than that of the solid boundary of axi-symmetrical body in the experimental range of Reynolds number between 5 X 10 ⁴ and 5 X 10 ⁵. And it was found that swimming speed of fishes is proportional to the body length and the oscillating frequency of the tail fin. Then, a new dimensionless number u/(f･ℓ) was introduced as a swimming number. In the present observations, the swimming numbers of fish of three species were coincident each other at the value of 0. 6, and this value also agreed with other species of a previous investigation...|$|E

40|$|Aim The {{scientific}} literature contains recent {{data on the}} prevalence of blindness and low vision for a few European countries, {{but most of these}} studies have been focused exclusively on the elderly sector of the populations. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to provide age-specific estimates of the prevalence and causes of visual loss in an Italian population aged 40 years and over. Methods In total, 847 of the 1200 citizens 440 years of age (70. 6 %) in the island community of Ponza underwent complete standardized ophthalmological examinations. Visual acuity (VA) was measured using a standard <b>logarithmic</b> <b>chart.</b> World health organization (WHO) definitions of blindness and low vision were adopted (respectively, VA > 1. 3 logMAR or a visual field 0. 5 to 1. 3 logMAR or a visual field < 20 degrees around central fixation). Prevalence rates based on presenting VAs were also calculated. Results The overall best-corrected prevalence rates were 0. 6 % (presenting, 0. 8 %) for better eye blindness, 2. 1 % (presenting, 6. 7 %) for better eye low vision, 1. 8 % (presenting, 2. 6 %) for monocular blindness, 5. 0 % (presenting, 11. 2 %) for monocular low vision. Cataract, glaucoma, degenerative myopia, and AMD were the main causes of better eye visual loss. Conclusion Age-specific prevalence rates in Ponza are fairly consistent with those for other European countries with similar socioeconomic conditions and public healthcare systems. A substantial percentage of visual losses remains uncorrected despite the availability of potentially curative therapy. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on educating the public regarding the importance of good vision...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of blindness and low vision over a 7 -year period. Design: Population-based cohort study. Participants: The survivors of the original cohort of 860 persons from Priverno, Italy, aged 45 to 69 years, were reexamined. Of the 760 eligible survivors, 619 (81. 4 %) had a 7 -year follow-up visit. Methods: Baseline and follow-up examinations included the collection of anamnestic and ophthalmologic data by the same observers using the same methods and classification criteria to minimize sources of variability. Main Outcome Measures: Best-corrected visual acuity (VA) measured at 4 m by standardized <b>logarithmic</b> <b>chart</b> was expressed as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). World Health Organization definitions of blindness and low vision were adopted (respectively, VA > 1. 3 logMar and VA > 0. 6 to 1. 3 logMar in the better eye or in either eye). Participants at risk for visual impairment were those without blindness or low vision in one or both eyes at baseline; participants at risk for one-eye visual impairment were those without blindness or low vision in both eyes at baseline. Results: A total of 33 participants were defined as incident cases of visual impairment. The overall incidence figures for blindness, low vision, one-eye blindness, and one-eye low vision were respectively 0. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [Cl], 0. 0 - 0. 9), 1. 3 % (95 % Cl, 0. 7 - 2. 6), 1. 2 % (95 % Cl, 0. 6 - 2. 4), and 2. 9 % (95 % Cl, 1. 8 - 4. 6). Conclusions: This study provides population-based estimates of {{the incidence of}} visual impairment in an adult, free-living European population. With respect to the younger participants, older subjects at baseline were at higher risk for incident visual impairment, the main causes of which were cataract, myopia, and diabetic retinopathy. The incidence of visual impairment in the subgroup aged 55 to 64 years at baseline {{was significantly higher than}} that found in Beaver Dam 5 -year study and similar to that found in Beaver Dam 10 -year Study, when the same definitions were adopted. This difference may be partially explained by social and cultural habits of the female samples, but many other factors may play a role...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{analyze the}} {{accuracy}} and the influencing factors of LAMBDA 100 retinometer {{in predicting the}} visual acuity of cataract patients with high axial myopia after phacoemulsification. METHODS: The retinal visual acuity was measured in 91 patients with 91 cataract eyes by LAMBDA 100, and compared with the best corrected visual acuity 2 wk after operations. If differences of predictive visual acuity and postoperative visual acuity between the two <b>logarithmic</b> visual acuity <b>chart</b> was within 2 lines, it was considered consistent. RESULTS: The total compliance rate was 62 %, the false positive rate was 2 %,the false negative rate was 36 %. The predictive accuracy was affected by lens opacity, the deeper opacity, the lower accuracy.

40|$|Age-related eye {{diseases}} of significant public health impact include lens opacities (cataracts) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A number of epidemiologic studies of dietary and serum levels of antioxidant vitamins suggest a protective role of antioxidants {{for these two}} ocular conditions. However, results are not consistent among the different studies. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large, randomized, and multicenter controlled clinical trial of antioxidant vitamins C (500 mg), E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15 mg), and zinc (80 mg as oxide with 2 mg cupric oxide) enrolled 4, 757 patients with varying degree of AMD. Antioxidant vitamins and zinc therapy reduced {{the risk of developing}} advanced AMD in participants with intermediate and greater risk of developing AMD by 25 percent. 1 The risk of vision loss of 3 lines or more on the <b>logarithmic</b> visual acuity <b>charts</b> also was reduced by 19 percent for these participants. For participants who developed AMD, the risk of such vision loss was reduced by 25 percent. These therapies had no effect on the progression of lens opacities or cataract surgery 2. These antioxidants and zinc are now recommended for participants who have at least intermediate risk of developing advanced AMD. At the end of the randomized clinical trial (October 2001), the participants were invited for further follow-up of 5 years to assess an...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects {{and safety of}} femtosecond laser assisted penetrating keratoplasty(FS-PKP). METHODS: In the retrospective case series study, 46 cases(48 eyes) with FS- PKP holds were analyzed. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was 2. 35 ± 1. 01 (with a standard <b>logarithmic</b> eye <b>chart).</b> Opacities were all from epithelium to endothelium, including keratoconus, keratolukoma and corneal scarring etc. The full-thickness corneal donor-recipient grafts in different diameter and incision kerfangle were made by femtosecond laser in keratoplasty. The patients were treated according to the conventional penetrating keratoplasty after surgery. Evaluation indexes included preoperative and postoperative 1, 6, 10 mo uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA), BCVA, corneal astigmatism(CA) and surgical complications. Forty-three cases(44 eyes) with traditional PKP were as control group. The data of two groups were analyzed by mean comparison of two groups and Chi-square test in SPSS 18. 0. RESULTS: All the operations were completed successfully, postoperative visual acuity of all patients had different degrees of increase. Comparison with the postoperative UCVA of traditional PKP surgery, UCVA was 3. 48 ± 0. 43 and 2. 97 ± 1. 14 at 1 mo after operation, respectively, with statistically significant difference(P = 0. 009). The UCVA was 3. 86 ± 0. 25 and 3. 74 ± 0. 73 at 3 mo after operation, respectively; the UCVA was 4. 04 ± 0. 23 and 3. 98 ± 0. 29 at 6 mo after operation, respectively, with {{no statistically significant difference}}(P = 0. 146, P = 0. 56). In FS-PKP group, BCVA was better than traditional PKP surgery group, with statistically significant difference(P = 0. 002). While there had no statistically significant difference between two groups of BCVA at 6, 10 mo after operation(P 6 mo = 0. 132, P 10 mo = 0. 47). The incidence of complication of FS-PKP surgery, such as postoperative astigmatism, postoperative intraocular pressure and postoperative incision dehiscence were significantly lower than the one of traditional PKP surgery(P CONCLUSION:Compared with traditional penetrating keratoplasty, FS-PKP provides significantly faster visual recovery in the early postoperative period, and induces significantly less corneal astigmatism and lower incidence of complication.

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} a new near-vision chart for children aged 3 - 5 years old and its clinical applications. METHODS: The new near-vision chart which combined the Bailey-Lovie layout with a newly devised set of symmetry symbols was designed based on Weber-Fechner law. It consists of 15 rows of symmetry symbols, corresponding to a visual acuity range from 1. 3 to 0. 1 logMAR. The optotypes were red against a white background and were specially shaped four basic geometric symbols:circle, square, triangle，and cross, which matched the preschool children''s cognitive level. A regular geometric progression of the optotype sizes and distribution was employed to arrange in 15 lines. The progression rate of the optotype size between two lines was 1. 2589 and two smaller groups of optotypes ranging from 0. 7 to - 0. 1 logMAR were included for repetitive testing. A near visual acuity was recorded in logMAR or decimal, and the testing distance was 25 cm. RESULTS: This new near-vision chart with pediatric acuity test optotypes which consists of 4 different symbols (triangle, square, cross, and circle) met the national and international eye chart design guidelines. When performing the near visual acuity assessment in preschoolers (3 - 5 years old). It overcame an inability to recognize {{the letters of the}} alphabet and difficulties in designating the direction of black abstract symbols such as the tumbling ''E'' or Landolt ''C'', which the subjects were prone to lose interest in. Near vision may be recorded in different notations:decimal acuity and logMAR. These two notations can be easily converted each other in the new near-vision chart. The measurements of this new chart not only showed a significant correlation and a good consistency with the Chinese national standard <b>logarithmic</b> near-vision <b>chart</b> (r = 0. 932, P< 0. 01), but also indicated good test-retest reliability (89 % of retest scores were within 0. 1 logMAR units of the initial test score) and a high response rate. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the validity and reliability of near visual acuity measurements using the new near-vision chart in children aged 3 - 5 y over a wide range of visual acuities, and the new eye chart was especially suitable for the detection of amblyopia risk factors and low vision examination in children (3 - 5 y of age).

METHODS: The study involved 18 eyes of 14 patients with PCO after uncomplicated phacoemulsification surgery and IOL implantation. All patients had taken examinations, including testing best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) by using standard <b>logarithmic</b> visual acuity <b>chart,</b> images of ocular anterior segment and AL by OCT. After the examinations, YAG was operated upon all patients. Each eye received one drop of Diclofenac Sodium Eye Drops immediately after YAG, and patients had taken examinations listed above again. One week later, BCVA and OCT were tested as well. Data(BCVA, tilt of IOLs, and AL) were recorded and analyzed statistically by SPSS. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 73. 93 ± 6. 94 y, including 5 males and 9 females, 8 left eyes and 10 right eyes, altogether 14 patients with 18 eyes. In this study, tilt of IOLs {{was defined as the}} angle of anterior surface of IOL and pupil plane(briefly called Tilt, unit:°). Before YAG, mean Tilt was 2. 896 ± 2. 286 °, mean AL was 23. 56 ± 0. 55 mm. 1 h after YAG, mean Tilt was 4. 702 ± 2. 991 °, mean AL was 23. 40 ± 0. 59 mm, and BCVA enhanced 3. 72 ± 1. 74 lines. 1 wk after YAG, 9 patients with 12 eyes were involved in the study. The mean Tilt of these 12 eyes was 3. 175 ± 1. 791 ° 1 h after YAG and 3. 434 ± 1. 835 ° 1 wk after YAG. There were significant differences between Tilt before YAG and Tilt 1 h after YAG.
