Alivandi's early paintings, including those from the 1980s, use the now-traditional medium of oil on canvas, yet his aesthetic style, which recalls the stained glass of medieval churches, is highly personal. During the 1990s Alivandi continued to work in oils, but abandoned the traditional canvas, choosing instead to apply his paints directly to newspaper; a method pioneered by the cubists in the early 1900s.Since circa 2000, he increasingly works with the angelique pointillage technique (as seen in {{the image on the}} right), a unique method of painting with extremely small dots of ink which are then covered with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> to lock and intensify the colours. This innovative pointillist technique has resulted in the many striking works that demonstrate the beauty of his composition and the power of his vision. According to one critic, his masterful blending of hues has earned him the title [...] "the magician of colours".|$|E

50|$|Although {{the use of}} two {{or three}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> wood <b>veneer</b> is ancient, modern 4' x 8' sheets of plywood with 5-11 core <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>veneer</b> were invented in the early 20th century, and began to become common by the Second World War. During the war, {{phenolic}} resin was more readily accessible than top grade wood veneer in Germany, and Luftwaffe pilot and inventor Max Himmelheber played a role in making the first sheets of particleboard, which were little more than pourings of floor sweepings, wood chips, and ground up off-cuts and glue. The first commercial piece was produced during World War II at a factory in Bremen, Germany. For its production, waste material was used - such as planer shavings, offcuts or sawdust - hammer-milled into chips and bound together with a phenolic resin. Hammer-milling involves smashing material into smaller and smaller pieces until they can pass through a screen. Most other early particleboard manufacturers used similar processes, though often with slightly different resins.|$|R

[...] Samuel Bentham was a British naval engineer with many shipbuilding inventions to his credit. Veneers at the time of Bentham were flat sawn, rift sawn or quarter sawn; i.e. cut along or across the log manually in different angles to the grain and thus limited in width and length.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The bond {{strength}} <b>of</b> zirconia <b>veneer</b> {{has been considered}} a weak link in the layered all-ceramic restoration. In a previous study, this bond was improved using a new category of veneering ceramics adopting the pressing technique; however, the resulting esthetic quality lacked the individual characterization built using the layering technique. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of combining both press-on and layering veneer ceramics in one restoration on the {{bond strength}} with zirconia frameworks. Materials and Methods: Zirconia discs (19. 4 mm in diameter, 3 -mm thick) were veneered with 3 -mm thick press-on veneer ceramic or veneered with 1 -mm thick press-on veneer ceramic and an additional 2 -mm thick <b>of</b> <b>layering</b> <b>veneer</b> ceramic. Two commercial layering veneer ceramics were tested. The specimens were sectioned into microbars, and the zirconia veneer microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was measured in a universal testing machine. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{was used to examine}} core veneer interface quality and to assess failure type. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDAX) was used to analyze the chemical structure <b>of</b> the tested <b>veneer</b> ceramics, which may affect the structural integrity <b>of</b> the double <b>veneered</b> restoration. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD post hoc tests were selected to analyze the data (p < 0. 05 was significant). Results: The MTBS of zirconia and press-on ceramic (34. 4 ± 2. 9 MPa) was not affected by the addition <b>of</b> a second <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> either <b>veneer</b> ceramic. SEM analysis revealed defect-free zirconia press-on veneer interface, while the interface between the press-on and the layering veneer ceramics demonstrated a different crystal structure and glass matrix, which did not affect wetting and contact between the two materials. EDAX analysis revealed differences, which account for the observed structural differences, in the chemical composition between the tested veneers. Conclusion: The double veneer technique combines the high bond strength and superior interface quality achieved using press-on ceramics with the superior esthetics and individual characterization obtained using layering ceramics. The technique promises superior function and performance <b>of</b> the double <b>veneered</b> restoration...|$|R

At first, LVL panels were manufactured with nine <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> wood <b>veneer</b> glued with phenol-formaldehyde resin. After, they were reinforced with fiberglass impregnated with epoxy or isophthalic resin or with isophthalic resin. The treatments consisted on the aplication of one, two and four reinforced layers. The properties tested were density, moisture content, static bending in flatwise and edgewise position, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), glue line shear strength by compression loading. The epoxy and the isophthalic resin showed the same mechanical qualities among different treatments. MOE panel in flatwise position was influenced by one reinforcement layer and MOR was influenced by two reinforcement layers. In the edgewise position, MOE and MOR values remained stable among the treatments with two fiberglass reinforcement layers. The epoxy resin presented higher glue line resistance and higher percentage of wood failure. Isophthalic and phenolic resin presented similar values of glue line strength.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the self-bonding <b>of</b> <b>veneers,</b> and investigations into the properties of boards obtained by hot-pressing beech veneers without adhesives. The raw material is pressed at temperatures from 200 to 250 ºC, at pressures from 4 to 6 MPa and pressing times from 240 to 360 s. The hot-pressing <b>of</b> five <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>veneers</b> results in a self-bonded, compressed, densified board, darker than the raw material. The manufacturing process was optimised using a statistical analysis, the response surface experimental design method. The input factors were the pressing parameters and the output factors were characteristics of the product, the raw material properties being kept constant. The results showed correlations between the pressing parameters, especially temperature, as input data and the physical and mechanical properties as responses. Resistance to water absorption and swelling as well as shear strength, bending strength, and hardness were all enhanced by more severe pressing conditions. All the samples pressed at 250 ºC became water-resistant while samples pressed at 200 ºC delaminated rapidly in water. It {{was found that the}} colour of the edges can be used as an indication of the hardness. Chemical investigations were performed on samples taken from veneers (raw material), bond-lines and inner parts <b>of</b> pressed <b>veneer.</b> A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to detect and compare the levels of water-soluble monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) in the veneer before pressing and the levels of 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF) and furfural in boards. From the results obtained in this thesis it is suggested, that besides other degraded compounds of hemicelluloses, the monosaccharides were transformed into hydroxymethyl-furfural during hot-pressing that could further participate in forming new browning compounds that are related to the bonding phenomenon. The UV spectroscopic analysis to evaluate the content of water-soluble phenols showed that the bond-line had a higher amount of conjugated phenols than the inner veneer suggesting a migration of degraded lignin towards the veneer surfaces during pressing. A CP/MAS 13 C NMR study on the solid material showed that the presence of β-ether structures and methoxyl groups in lignin was higher in the bond-line, supporting the hypothesis of a migration of lignin and possibly a condensation reaction occurring at higher temperatures, explaining the water-resistance property acquired by the boards. In a comparative study, oxidative activation with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate as a catalyst was performed before pressing. Boards made from beech veneer subjected to the pre-treatment step showed a greater mass loss, a lower thickness swelling but also a somewhat lower shear strength. For beech veneers such an oxidative pre-treatment step could be used to gain water-resistant boards pressed at lower pressing temperatures or shorter times than those needed to bond untreated veneers. Scots pine veneers were found to be less suitable for self-bonding than beech <b>veneers.</b> Boards <b>of</b> Scots pine hot-pressed without the oxidative pre-treatment delaminated in water, whereas, under the same pressing conditions, boards made from pre-treated veneers showed a water-resistant bond-line.
