5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> to him.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|Raked wingtips, {{similar to}} the ones used on the 777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 787 aircraft, are used on the new 747 variant instead of {{winglets}} used on the 747-400. These wingtip structures help reduce the wingtip vortices at the lateral edges of the wings, decreasing wake turbulence and drag, and thereby improving fuel efficiency. Another effort to reduce weight is the introduction of fly-by-wire technology {{for the majority of the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R

25|$|Only {{a single}} {{prototype}} was built. It was assigned {{the serial number}} B9909, although this is not visible on surviving photographs of the type. Official flight testing started in July 1917 at RAF Martlesham Heath. Performance was excellent – it had about the same speed as the S.E.5a, but climbed rather better. The only complaints about its handling were of poor <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> (early S.E.5s had similar problems, which were quickly resolved).|$|E

40|$|In {{the energy}} {{efficient}} transport (EET) Horizontal Tails Investigation, aerodynamic data were measured for five different horizontal tails {{on a full}} span model with a wide body fuselage. Three of the horizontal tails were low tail configurations and two were T tail configurations. All tails were tested in conjunction with two wings, a current wide body wing and a high aspect ratio supercritical wing. Local downwash angles and dynamic pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the tails were measured using a yaw head rake. The results provide a comparison of the aerodynamic characteristics of the two wing configurations at trimmed conditions for Mach numbers between 0. 60 and 0. 90. In the EET <b>Lateral</b> <b>Controls</b> Investigation, the control effectiveness of a conventional set of <b>lateral</b> <b>controls</b> was measured over a Mach number range from 0. 60 to 0. 90 on a high aspect ratio supercritical wing semispan model.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two types of drip {{irrigation}} line design on cotton yield, water use, and net returns. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} arid region of Xinjiang, Northwest China, during 2009 - 2010 growing years. The two types of lateral placement are commonly used by the local farmers in the area: double lines (two <b>laterals</b> <b>controlling</b> four rows) and single line designs (one <b>lateral</b> <b>controlling</b> four rows). The results indicated that less irrigation water was applied by single line compared with double lines design. This implies that more irrigation water could be saved using single line, by reducing the water consumption of cotton. The emergence rates for double lines were 2 and 6 % higher than those for single line design in 2009 and 2010. The seed cotton yields for double lines design were 5. 76 and 6. 41 Mg ha(- 1) which were 13 and 9 % higher than for single line design in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Single lines could however lower the investment cost compared to double lines, which produced 10 and 7 % more net income in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

25|$|The {{prototype}} B-47's long, {{swept wing}} {{was prone to}} twisting during roll maneuvers which caused a dangerous behavior known as aileron reversal to occur at airspeeds lower than expected. Based on experience with earlier aircraft, Townsend proposed the use of spoiler ailerons on the B-47 to reduce this unwanted behavior. The use of spoiler ailerons to reduce wing twisting was first tested on the B-47, and although not used on production B-47s, became standard issue for <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> on many later jets.|$|E
25|$|While some of {{the initial}} batch of Sea Hawks would see {{operational}} service, many of the F1 aircraft would be mostly used for various service trials. Amongst these, WF143 would later be rebuilt as the prototype for the Sea Hawk F2, featuring power-assisted ailerons in place of their unpowered counterparts on the F1, to which flight trials had demonstrated a weakness in <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> leading to instances of oscillation. On 24 February 1954, the first production Sea Hawk F2, WF240, conducted its maiden flight at Bitteswell. A total of 40 F2 aircraft would be produced.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>lateral</b> guidance <b>control</b> of a low-speed vehicle. Several topics are studied in detail: (1) vehicle error-state model for lateral guidance based on Ackerman steering and (2) <b>lateral</b> guidance <b>control</b> of a low-speed vehicle using fuzzy logic. Independently written research papers address each topic. The first paper presents a second order 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 kinematic model based on Ackerman steering appropriate {{for studying the}} <b>lateral</b> guidance <b>control</b> of low-speed vehicles traversing on roads of constant curvature. <b>Lateral</b> guidance <b>control</b> of vehicles is {{of great interest to}} the Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS) Division of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) community. Both linear and nonlinear models are derived in detail. The error states considered are the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s lateral error and heading error measured with respect to the instantaneous road centerline tangent. In addition to the derivation, both simulation and experimental results are presented with very good correspondence being achieved. The second paper investigates the performance of several different controllers used to perform <b>lateral</b> guidance <b>control</b> of a low-speed vehicle described as a linear nonminimum-phase 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 bicycle model based on Ackerman steering. Both a conventional type I proportional-integral (PI) controller and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are considered. The PI controller is designed using standard techniques and the two-level FLC / PI controller adjusts both proportional and integral feedback control gains around the baseline values based on heuristics and the current conditions as measured by the lateral error. Time-based simulations using MATLAB / SIMULINK permit a comparison between both controllers for several different simulation scenarios of interest. Primary performance metrics considered were percent overshoot and settling time in response to a step input. In general, the two-level FLC / PI controller performed better; 6...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} made of a triangular-wing-airplane model equfpped with {{high-lift}} devices and <b>lateral</b> and directional <b>controls.</b> The model consisted of an aspect ratio 4 triangular wing in combination with a fuselage of fineness ratio 12. 5; a thin, triangular, vertical tail with a constant-chord rudder; and a thin, unswept, all-movable horizontal tail.

25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges.

The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E

25|$|The second F.E.2 {{was officially}} a rebuild {{of the first}} F.E.2, and may, indeed have {{included}} some components from the earlier aircraft.

Loaded weight rose from 1,200lb (545kg) to 1,865lb (848kg). The new F.E.2 used the outer wings of the B.E.2a, with wing warping instead of ailerons for <b>lateral</b> <b>control,</b> and was powered by a 70hp Renault engine.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, <b>lateral</b> <b>control</b> was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary flight control surfaces were actutated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E

25|$|Wing warping {{consists}} of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce <b>lateral</b> <b>control.</b> The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, {{came up with the}} idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.|$|E
