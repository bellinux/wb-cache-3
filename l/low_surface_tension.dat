However, an excess of cholesterol {{has been associated with}} impaired surface activity of surfactant. It has also been reported that surfactant protein SP-C interacts with cholesterol in lipid/protein interfacial films. In this study, we analyzed the effect of SP-C on the thermodynamic properties of phospholipid membranes containing cholesterol, and the ability of lipid/protein complexes containing cholesterol to form and respread interfacial films capable of producing very <b>low</b> <b>surface</b> <b>tensions</b> upon repetitive compression-expansion cycling. SP-C modulates the effect of cholesterol to reduce the enthalpy associated with the gel-to-liquid-crystalline melting transition in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers, as analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The {{presence of}} SP-C affects more subtly the effects of cholesterol on the thermotropic properties of ternary membranes, mimicking more closely the lipid composition of native surfactant, where SP-C facilitates the miscibility of the sterol. Incorporation of 1 % or 2 % SP-C (protein/phospholipid by weight) promotes almost instantaneous adsorption of suspensions of DPPC/palmitoyloleoylphospatidylcholine (POPC) /palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) (50 : 25 : 15, w/w/w) into the air-liquid interface of a captive bubble, in both the absence and presence of cholesterol.

Supplementing exogenous surfactant to newborns suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a leading cause of perinatal mortality, has completely altered neonatal care in industrialized countries. Surfactant therapy has also been applied to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but with only limited success. Biophysical studies suggest that surfactant inhibition is partially responsible for this unsatisfactory performance. This paper reviews the biophysical properties of functional and dysfunctional PS. The biophysical properties of PS are further limited to surface activity, i. e., properties related to highly dynamic and very <b>low</b> <b>surface</b> <b>tensions.</b> Three main perspectives are reviewed.

We utilized the nanoscale sensitivity of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine phospholipid (PL) phase transition and multilayer formation for two Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) systems: a simple 3 PL surfactant-like mixture and the more complex bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES). AFM height images demonstrated that both systems develop two types of liquid condensed (LC) domains (micro- and nano-sized) within a liquid expanded phase (LE). The 3 PL mixture failed to form significant multilayers at high surface pressure (π while BLES forms an extensive network of multilayer structures containing up to three bilayers. A close examination of the progression of multilayer formation reveals that multilayers start to form {{at the edge of}} the solid-like LC domains and also in the fluid-like LE phase. We used the elemental analysis capability of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to show that multilayer structures are enriched in unsaturated PLs while the saturated PLs are concentrated in the remaining interfacial monolayer. This supports a modified squeeze-out model where film compression results in the hydrophobic surfactant protein-dependent formation of unsaturated PL-rich multilayers which remain functionally associated with a monolayer enriched in disaturated PL species.
