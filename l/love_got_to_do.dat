In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving the right to sue the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone described the song as a [...] "warm bed of soul sounds."

The album contained the song [...] "What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It", which became Turner's biggest hit and won four Grammy Awards including Record of the Year.

[...] Other than helping Bassett with her wardrobe and teaching her dance steps as well as providing songs for the soundtrack, and appearing as herself at the end of the film, she refused to be involved fully in the film, telling an interviewer, [...] "Why would I want to see Ike Turner beat me up again? I haven't dwelled on it; it's all in the past where it belongs." [...] Following the film's and soundtrack's release, Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years. Following the tour's end, Turner moved to Switzerland and took a year off from the road at the end of the tour.|$|E

The record became a hit, reaching several European charts, including a top 10 placement in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Turner's first solo {{entry into the}} U.S. charts. It also peaked at the top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Black Singles charts. The success of the song forced Capitol to rethink its contract with Turner, offering the singer a three album deal, demanding an album on short notice, which had Turner staging what Ebony magazine later called an [...] "amazing comeback." [...] Recorded in two months in London, the album, Private Dancer, was released in June 1984. That same month, Capitol issued the album's second single, [...] "What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It.", earlier recorded by the rock group Bucks Fizz in 1984.

The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It".|$|E
500|$|In December of the {{following}} year, Turner was recognized by the Kennedy Center Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. and was elected to join an elite group of entertainers. President George W.

[...] Several artists paid tribute to her that night including Oprah Winfrey, Melissa Etheridge (performing [...] "River Deep - Mountain High"), Queen Latifah (performing [...] "What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It"), Beyoncé (performing [...] "Proud Mary"), and Al Green (performing [...] "Let's Stay Together"). Winfrey stated, [...] "We don't need another hero. We need more heroines like you, Tina. You make me proud to spell my name w-o-m-a-n," [...] In November, Turner released All the Best – Live Collection and it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Turner participated in the soundtrack to All the Invisible Children, providing duet vocals to the song [...] "Teach Me Again", with singer Elisa, finding success in Italy where it peaked at the top spot.|$|E

500|$|On July 18, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Alexandra Shipp replaced Zendaya for the role of Aaliyah for the Lifetime TV biopic movie , which premiered on November 15, 2014. Zendaya drew criticism because people felt that she was too light skinned and did not greatly resemble Aaliyah. She voiced her strong respect for Aaliyah before dropping out of the project. She explained her choice to withdraw from the film in videos on Instagram. Aaliyah's family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family would prefer a [...] "major studio release along the lines" [...] of What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It, the biopic based on the life of Tina Turner. Aaliyah's family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using [...] "any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos" [...] they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network [...] "didn't reach out." [...] On August 9, 2014, it {{was announced}} that Chattrisse Dolabaille and Izaak Smith had been cast as Aaliyah's collaborators Missy Elliott and Timbaland.

500|$|It was in {{the video}} of [...] "Material Girl" [...] that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being {{compared}} to Monroe. However, she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche. Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women, but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways. The fan in Monroe's hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra (wheel) held by the Indian idol Vishnu. Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert, who wrote Madonna as postmodern myth: how one star's self-construction rewrites sex, said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice, eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962. Madonna's fan, which appeared {{at the end of}} the video, signified that Madonna– while paying her tribute to Monroe– was signaling that she had no intention of being a victim like her, and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth. Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna's identity as the song suggested, with the purpose of shifting [...] "Madonna's image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star." [...] Lisa A. Lewis, author of Gender, Politics and MTV said that with the video, Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to Tina Turner's [...] "What's <b>Love</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with It". The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos.|$|E
