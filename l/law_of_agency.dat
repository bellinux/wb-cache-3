2500|$|Suffolk Law School has a 3-year day {{program and}} a 4-year evening program {{offering}} a broad selection of courses.

A course in Professional Responsibility is required, and each student must also fulfill legal writing and legal skills requirements prior to graduation. Until 2008 Fiduciary Relations, a class concentrating on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agency</b> and Trusts, was required. [...] Upon completion of the required curriculum, students at Suffolk choose from over 200 upper-level courses, many of which focus on learning practical skills, including several legal clinics. Students may also receive credit for diverse internships and clerkships, including those at various courts in the Boston area. Academic concentrations are available in Civil Litigation, Financial Services, Health/Biomedical, and Intellectual Property.|$|E

2500|$|In {{three main}} situations, English law allows people who lack legal {{capacity}} to contract to escape from enforcement of agreements and recover property that was conveyed, to reverse unjust enrichment. First, a person may be {{too young to be}} bound by large or onerous contracts. Minors, under 18 years, can bind themselves to contracts for [...] "necessaries" [...] to pay a reasonable price, but only unusual contracts, such as for eleven luxury waistcoats will not be deemed [...] "necessaries". While the adult contracting party is bound, the minor has the option to rescind the contract, so long as one of the four equitable bars (lapse of time, affirmation, third party rights, counter-restitution possible) is not present. Second, people who are mentally incapacitated, for instance because they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 or they are completely , are in principle bound to agreements when the other person could not or did not know they lacked mental capacity. But if the other person did know or should have known, then the mentally incapacitated individual may no longer have agreements for non-necessaries enforced upon them. Third, companies can generally bind themselves to any agreement, even though many (particularly older) companies have a limited range of objects that their members (in most companies this means shareholders) have consented that the business is for. Under the Companies Act 2006 sections 39 and 40, if a third party contracting with the company in bad faith takes advantage of a director or officer to procure an agreement, that contract will be wholly void. This is a high threshold, and in practice no longer relevant, particularly since 2006 companies may elect to have unrestricted objects. It is more likely that a contract ceases to be enforceable because, as a matter of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> the third party should have reasonably known that the person contracting lacked authority to enter an agreement. In this situation a contract is voidable at the instance of the company, and could only be enforced against the (probably less solvent) employee.|$|E
2500|$|Common law, {{state and}} federal {{statutes}} usually confer labor rights on [...] "employees", but not people who are autonomous and have sufficient bargaining power to be [...] "independent contractors". In 1994, the [...] recommended a unified definition of an employee under all federal labor laws, to reduce litigation, {{but this was not}} implemented. As it stands, Supreme Court cases have stated various general principles, which will apply according to the context and purpose of the statute in question. In NLRB v Hearst Publications, Inc, newsboys who sold newspapers in Los Angeles claimed that they were [...] "employees", so that they had a right to collectively bargain under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The newspaper corporations argued the newsboys were [...] "independent contractors", and they were under no duty to bargain in good faith. The Supreme Court held the newsboys were employees, and common law tests of employment, particularly the summary in the Restatement of the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agency,</b> Second §220, were no longer appropriate. They were not [...] "independent contractors" [...] because of the degree of control employers had. But the National Labor Relations Board could decide itself who was covered if it had [...] "a reasonable basis in law." [...] Congress reacted, first, by explicitly amending the NLRA §2(1) so that independent contractors were exempt from the law while, second, disapproving that the common law was irrelevant. At the same time, the Supreme Court decided United States v Silk, holding that [...] "economic reality" [...] {{must be taken into account}} when deciding who is an employee under the Social Security Act of 1935. This meant a group of coal loaders were employees, having regard to their economic position, including their lack of bargaining power, the degree of discretion and control, and the risk they assumed compared to the coal businesses they worked for. By contrast, the Supreme Court found truckers who owned their own trucks, and provided services to a carrier company, were independent contractors. Thus, it is now accepted that multiple factors of traditional common law tests may not be replaced if a statute gives no further definition of [...] "employee" [...] (as is usual, e.g., the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993). Alongside the purpose of labor legislation to mitigate inequality of bargaining power and redress the economic reality of a worker's position, the multiple factors found in the Restatement of Agency must be considered, though none is necessarily decisive.|$|E

50|$|In law, the {{relationship}} that exists when one person or party (the principal) engages another (the agent) to act for him, e.g. to do his work, to sell his goods, to manage his business. The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> thus governs the legal relationship in which the agent deals with a third party {{on behalf of the}} principal. The competent agent is legally capable of acting for this principal vis-à-vis the third party. Hence, the process of concluding a contract through an agent involves a twofold relationship. On the one hand, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> is concerned with the external business relations of an economic unit and with the powers of the various representatives to affect the legal position of the principal. On the other hand, it rules the internal relationship between principal and agent as well, thereby imposing certain duties on the representative (diligence, accounting, good faith, etc.).|$|E

5000|$|The first {{situation}} {{applies only}} when the work's creator is an employee, not an independent contractor. The determination of whether an individual is an employee {{for the purposes of}} the work made for hire doctrine is determined under the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> in which a court looks to a multitude of factors to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists. In the Supreme Court case affirming that the common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> should be used to distinguish employees from independent contractors in the work for hire context, Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, the Court listed some of these factors: In determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> we consider the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required; the source of the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party. See Restatement § 220(2) (setting forth a non-exhaustive list of factors relevant to determining whether a hired party is an employee)." ...|$|E
