5000|$|TeamViewer may be {{installed}} with an installation procedure, although the 'Quick Support' version will run without installation. To connect to another computer, TeamViewer {{has to be}} running on both machines. To install TeamViewer, administrator access is required, but once installed it can be run by any user. When TeamViewer is started on a computer, it generates a partner ID and password (user-defined passwords are also supported). To establish a connection between a <b>local</b> <b>client</b> and a remote client, TeamViewer generated ID and password of either client are required. The <b>local</b> <b>client</b> requires the remote client's ID and password to gain control over the remote client, whereas the remote client requires the local client's ID and password to gain control over the <b>local</b> <b>client.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} Nache, a caching proxy for NFSv 4 that enables a {{consistent}} cache of a remote NFS server {{to be maintained}} and shared across multiple <b>local</b> NFS <b>clients.</b> Nache leverages the features of NFSv 4 to improve the performance of file accesses in a widearea distributed setting by bringing the data closer to the client. Conceptually, Nache acts as an NFS server to the <b>local</b> <b>clients</b> and as an NFS client to the remote server. To provide cache consistency, Nache exploits the read and write delegations support in NFSv 4. Nache enables the cache and the delegation to be shared among a set of <b>local</b> <b>clients,</b> thereby reducing conflicts and improving performance. We have implemented Nache in the Linux 2. 6 kernel. Using Filebench workloads and other benchmarks, we present the evaluation of Nache and show that it can reduce the NFS operations at the server by 10 - 50 %. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between audit partner rotation and audit fees for a sample of Australian firms from 2007 to 2010. We find a significant positive association between audit fees and partner rotation {{in the year of}} rotation. The association persists in the first year post rotation {{and to a lesser extent}} in the second year post rotation. Our analysis suggests that higher audit fees are associated with both mandatory and voluntary partner rotation. However, when we divide the sample into large global clients, mid-level <b>clients</b> and small <b>local</b> <b>clients,</b> we find that mandatory and voluntary rotation are associated with higher audit fees for large global clients while only voluntary rotation is associated with higher audit fees for small <b>local</b> <b>clients.</b> We do not find an association between partner rotation and audit fees for mid-level clients. Our study suggests that the extent to which firms are able to pass on the costs of partner rotation varies across different segments of the audit market...|$|R
