As there are no generally accepted standards for characterization of such devices, we used Transmission <b>Line</b> <b>Pulsing</b> (TLP) to determine trigger- and clamping-voltages as well as leakage currents. Using short duration pulses (less than 10 ns) from a Very-Fast Transmission <b>Line</b> <b>Pulser</b> (VF-TLP) gives information of the transient behavior during pulsing.

5000|$|In {{a simple}} charged {{transmission}} <b>line</b> <b>pulse</b> generator (animation, right) {{a length of}} transmission line such as a coaxial cable is connected through a switch to a matched load RL at one end, and {{at the other end}} to a DC voltage source V through a resistor RS which is large compared to the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line. [...] When the power supply is connected it slowly charges up the capacitance of the line through RS. When the switch is closed, a voltage equal to V/2 is applied to the load, the charge stored in the line begins to discharge through the load a current of V/2Z0 [...] and a voltage step travels up the line toward the source. [...] The source end of the line is approximately an open circuit due to the high RS, so the step is reflected uninverted and travels back down the line toward the load. The result is that a pulse of voltage is applied to the load with a duration equal to 2D/c where D is the length of the line and c is the propagation velocity of the pulse in the line. [...] The propagation velocity in typical transmission lines is within 50% of the speed of light. For example, in most types of coaxial cable the propagation velocity is approximately 2/3 the speed of light, or 20 cm per nanosecond.|$|E

Using an optical frequency between absorption components from different isotopes allows the delay to be increased or decreased by optical pumping with a second laser, producing rapid tuning over a range more than 40 % of the initial delay.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of resistor properties is the value stability under different electrical and non electrical influences. Mechanical or thermal stress together with the electrical one represents the main factors that have a major contribution in resistor value stability. With shrinking resistor geometries of discrete, integrated and integral passives, the electrical stress gains more and more importance, especially under short duration voltage pulses. The analytical test technique of Transmission <b>Line</b> <b>Pulsing</b> (TLP) allows, on the basis of square pulses, the in-situ monitoring of the voltages and currents at the DUT and helps to gain fundamental insights into the electrical behavior. The resistance change due to an applied high voltage pulse {{is a measure of the}} electrostatic discharge susceptibility of thin film resistors. The influence of the pulse width (1. 5 ns, 10 ns, 100 ns and 300 ns) and amplitude on the susceptibility was investigated on thin film re sistors.
