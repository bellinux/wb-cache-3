50|$|Concluding, the {{treatment}} of <b>lyophilization</b> (freeze dried) of donkey’s milk demonstrated that the natural colour, flavours, nutrients, bioactive substances of the fresh donkey milk are retained. Instead, with the spray-drying method, another way to dry products, the milk is being heated whereby vitamins and other important bioactive substances will get lost. In addition Freeze-dried don't require chemical preservatives and can be either consumed directly or re hydrated easily. However, this method for its high costs is practiced only by a few companies.|$|E
50|$|Freeze drying (or <b>lyophilization)</b> removes {{water from}} the ice cream by {{lowering}} the air pressure {{to a point where}} ice sublimates from a solid to a gas. The ice cream is placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen until the water crystallizes. The air pressure is lowered, creating a partial vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, sublimating the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a freeze-dried ice cream slice.|$|E

50|$|Biomatrica is a United States-based {{biotechnology}} {{company that}} develops chemistry for ambient temperature preservation of biological {{materials for the}} purpose of expanding the availability and accuracy of medical diagnostics and research. Specifically, the company focuses on improving the stability of biological materials, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and cells from patient samples and in research and diagnostic testing reagents. Company scientists have developed alternatives to existing preservation technologies, such as cold storage and <b>lyophilization</b> (freeze-drying), to prevent degradation of perishable biological materials. Biomatrica's technologies are used in applications such as pre-analytic sample collection, diagnostic assays, biobanking, forensics, and basic research.|$|E
50|$|Freeze drying or <b>lyophilization</b> is a drying method {{where the}} solvent is frozen prior to drying and is then sublimed, i.e., {{passed to the}} gas phase {{directly}} from the solid phase, below the melting point of the solvent. It is increasingly applied to dry foods, beyond its already classical pharmaceutical or medical applications. It keeps biological properties of proteins, and retains vitamins and bioactive compounds. Pressure can be reduced by a high vacuum pump (though freeze drying at atmospheric pressure is possible in dry air). If using a vacuum pump, the vapor produced by sublimation {{is removed from the}} system by converting it into ice in a condenser, operating at very low temperatures, outside the freeze drying chamber.|$|E
50|$|In laboratories, {{spatulas}} and microspatulas {{are small}} stainless steel utensils, used for scraping, transferring, or applying powders and paste like chemicals or treatments. Many spatula brands are also resistant to acids, bases, heat, and solvents, which make them {{ideal for use}} {{with a wide range}} of compound. A common type would be stainless steel spatulas, which are widely used because they are sturdy and affordable. They are resistant to deterioration from contact with boiling water, acids, bases, and most solvents. Some of them come with Polyvinyl chloride plastic handle or riveted hardwood for better handling. Polystyrene spatulas are made for researchers because they are disposable, preventing any potential contaminations which occurs often with reusable spatulas. They are also ideal for handling lyophilized products or performing <b>lyophilization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Native {{chemical}} ligation {{is carried}} out in aqueous solution and frequently gives near-quantitative yields of the desired ligation product. The challenge lies {{in the preparation of}} the necessary unprotected peptide-thioester building block. Peptide-thioesters are usually prepared by Boc chemistry SPPS; a thioester-containing peptide cannot be synthesized using a nucleophilic base, thus disfavoring Fmoc chemistry. Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis techniques for generating peptide-thioesters are known; they make use of modifications of the Kenner 'safety catch' linker. In making peptide segments for use in native chemical ligation, protecting groups that release aldehydes or ketones should be avoided since these may cap the N-terminal cysteine. For the same reason, the use of acetone should be avoided, particularly prior to <b>lyophilization</b> and in washing glassware.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{freeze-drying}} {{was developed}} during World War II. Blood serum {{being sent to}} Europe from the US for medical treatment of the wounded required refrigeration, {{but because of the}} lack of simultaneous refrigeration and transport, many serum supplies were spoiling before reaching their intended recipients. The freeze-drying process was developed as a commercial technique that enabled serum to be rendered chemically stable and viable without having to be refrigerated. Shortly thereafter, the freeze-dry process was applied to penicillin and bone, and <b>lyophilization</b> became recognized as an important technique for preservation of biologicals. Since that time, freeze-drying has been used as a preservation or processing technique for a wide variety of products. These applications include the following but are not limited to: the processing of food, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic kits; the restoration of water damaged documents; the preparation of river-bottom sludge for hydrocarbon analysis; the manufacturing of ceramics used in the semiconductor industry; the production of synthetic skin; the manufacture of sulfur-coated vials; and the restoration of historic/reclaimed boat hulls.|$|E

5000|$|Solvents {{with higher}} boiling points {{such as water}} (100 °C at {{standard}} atmospheric pressure, 760 torr or 1 bar), dimethylformamide (DMF, 153 °C at the same), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 189 °C at the same), can also be evaporated if the unit's vacuum system is capable of sufficiently low pressure. (For instance, both DMF and DMSO will boil below 50 °C if the vacuum is reduced from 760 torr to 5 torr 1 bar to 6.6 mbar) However, more recent developments are often applied in these cases (e.g., evaporation while centrifuging or vortexing at high speeds). Rotary evaporation for high boiling hydrogen bond-forming solvents such as water is often a last recourse, as other evaporation methods or freeze-drying (<b>lyophilization)</b> are available. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that in such solvents, the tendency to [...] "bump" [...] is accentuated. The modern centrifugal evaporation technologies are particularly useful when one has many samples to do in parallel, as in medium- to high-throughput synthesis now expanding in industry and academia.|$|E

50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression tabletting, {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and <b>lyophilization</b> processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the die wall. Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as crospovidone, and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate, for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E
