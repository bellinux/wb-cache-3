For example, for a <b>lift-truck</b> operator, a written and a practical exam would identify areas of training that {{may need to}} be revisited. Furthermore administering a pre-test and post-test will establish a knowledge base line or reference point to measure training effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|ATLS vehicle loading {{technologies}} {{significantly reduce}} the manpower required on the shipping and receiving docks, eliminate product damage, accidents, and ergonomic injuries related to <b>lift-truck</b> operation. Generally, products can be loaded quicker and product density is increased resulting in more payload per shipment which reduces shipping cost, using a loading automation system. Loading automation is often the key component to achieve complete plant automation.|$|E

CDZ's are currently installed mostly at automotive OEM's and their Tier 1 & 2 supplier networks. In recent years more industries have adapted a process to assist with [...] "Clean Factory Solutions" [...] and achieve a higher standard of technical cleanliness. Food & Beverage manufacturers have also started to implement a [...] "Clean Driving Zone" [...] at their sites to assist with disinfecting wheels to prevent contamination or cross-contamination.|$|E

In this thesis, a system of Mechanical Conveyor belt has been developed and proof of concept has been tested for further testing and trial purpose. The main reason behind proposed system is to automate small scale industries which {{are not able to}} afford expansive automation systems...|$|E
40|$|High {{comfort for}} the driver in working {{vehicles}} is an important feature {{as well as a}} demand from the drivers. Low noise level is an essential factor for the manufacturer to maintain a high standard and comfort of vehicles. In many cases the noise inside the cabin can be related to the engine orders. Hydraulic pumps and fans are also related to the engine but not necessarily integers of the engine order. Passive absorbers are not suitable for the lowest frequencies and one approach is to use an active noise control system to solve the noise problem at low frequencies. In the present experiment loudspeakers were mounted inside the cabin of a fork <b>lift-truck</b> to produce the secondary noise field. To sense the residual noise, microphones were installed close to the driver's head. The aim is to create a zone of reduced noise around the head. Since {{a large portion of the}} noise inside the cabin can be related to the engine, an active control system based on a feedforward solution is possible. Experimental results from a feedforward solution of active noise control in a fork-lift truck cabin show that the noise level in the low frequency region can be reduced significantly...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design stage comparison {{of an existing}} ‘big box’ material supply strategy common in Swedish manufacturing to a proposed ‘narrow bin’ approach common in Japanese production systems. Performance times, walking distances, layout space requirements were evaluated for 6 workstations using ‘big boxes’ of parts along the line. Biomechanical loading on spine and shoulder was estimated {{for one of the}} workstations. Comparisons were made to simulated layouts with the ‘narrow bin’ approach. The use of narrow bin supply yielded significant reductions in rack lengths (− 81 %), Material Areas (− 61 %), Walking Distances (− 61 %), Indirect Work (− 24 %), and Cycle times (− 8 %). Peak and cumulative spinal load estimates showed reductions from 29 % to 65 % with similar load reductions in shoulders and hands. The ‘narrow bin’ strategy also has implications for the material re-supply system, enables the use of flexible racking and can reduce <b>lift-truck</b> use. Work intensification may increase risks if time-gains are used only to increase direct assembly work repetitions. It is concluded that the narrow bin supply strategy has potential to both improve productivity and reduce risk characteristics of the system. Further field testing is required. Relevance to industry: Supplying materials in smaller narrower bins poses a potential ‘win-win’ design tactic with decreased operator risks and improved performance in final assembly when compared to ‘big box’ supply strategies. The final choice of strategy requires a context-specific assessment...|$|E
