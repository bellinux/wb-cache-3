5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
40|$|AbstractRepresentations <b>of</b> {{inductive}} <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> finite-dimensional Lie {{groups and}} algebras am our main objects of study. Such representations {{can be constructed}} by taking inductive <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite-dimensional groups or algebras. For (finite dimensional) Lie groups and algebras of Hermitian symmetric type, Enright-Howe-Wallach classified those highest weight representations which are unitarizable. In this paper we consider <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algebras u(p, n), so*(2 n) and sp(n, R), <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding maximal compact subgroup and <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding generalized Verma modules. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the inductive limit representation to be unitarizable. In all three cases we show that {{a necessary condition for}} unitarizability is that the highest weight is eventually constant. We also give sufficient conditions (depending on the constant) which will ensure that the limit is unitarizable...|$|R

As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
