5|$|Work for {{the actors}} began in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles {{was recorded in}} studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they found their performances no different to film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted such {{that they could not}} ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with directorial approval. To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with Grand Theft Auto IV. He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> (1957–63) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} solid and {{consistent}} ratings, <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> never {{climbed into the}} Nielsen's top-30 though similar sitcoms of the period like Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, The Real McCoys, and Dennis the Menace managed to do so.|$|E
25|$|The series entered {{syndication}} in {{many cities}} four days following completion of the ABC summer repeats. By the mid-1970s, the show was only on in a few markets, {{one of which was}} Atlanta, Georgia on Ted Turner's Channel 17, WTCG. In 1976, when WTGC went on satellite and became a Superstation available nationwide, <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> was exposed nationwide. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> gained in popularity. In Chicago, the show aired on a shaky independent station 44 WSNS. But when WSNS began to phase in subscription TV in 1980, they did not renew and WGN-TV, which also became a Superstation picked it up. So in the early 1980s the show was airing in most large, major, and medium TV markets. Still, TBS and WGN showed it for many years in the late 1980s and into the 90s (TBS sometimes running it back-to-back with the New <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> on occasion), and briefly on Nick at Nite from July 12, 2002 – August 10, 2002 as part of TV Land Sampler. It aired on TV Land in July 1998 where it has been shown until November 2012. Today, NBC Universal Television owns the syndication rights and all properties related to the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{show was}} created by the writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher. These {{veterans}} of radio and early television found inspiration for the show's characters, plots and dialogue in the lives, experiences and conversations of their own children. <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> {{is one of the first}} primetime sitcom series written from a child's point of view. Like several television dramas and sitcoms of the late 1950s and early 1960s (Lassie and My Three Sons), <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> is a glimpse of middle-class American boyhood. In a typical episode, Beaver gets into some sort of boyish scrape, then faces his parents for reprimand and correction. Neither parent was omniscient; the series often showed the parents debating their approach to child rearing, and some episodes were built around parental gaffes.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} two seasons, <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> was filmed at Republic Studios in Studio City, Los Angeles. For its final four seasons, {{production}} moved to Universal Studios. Exteriors, including the façades of the two Cleaver houses, were filmed on the respective studio back lots. Stock footage was often used for establishing shots.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of how children {{interact with their}} brothers and sisters on such 1950s situation comedy television programs as <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> and Father Knows Best with those on such 1980s programs as The Cosby Show and Family Ties found that children interacted more positively in the early period but were important and central – if more conflictual – to the main story action in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|<b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> faced stiff {{competition}} in its time slots. During its {{next to last}} season, for example, the show ran against The Defenders, a program examining highly charged courtroom cases about abortion and the death penalty. In its final season, the show was up against Perry Mason and Dr. Kildare but was in the ABC line-up with television greats The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, The Donna Reed Show, and My Three Sons.|$|E
25|$|The show's chief writers, Bob Mosher and Joe Connelly, {{met while}} working in New York City for the J. Walter Thompson Agency. Once in Hollywood, the men became head writers for the radio show Amos 'n' Andy and {{continued}} to write the well-received show when it moved to CBS television in 1950. Although both men initially wrote all the scripts for earlier episodes of <b>Leave</b> <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver,</b> after becoming executive producers they began accepting scripts from other writers, refining them, if necessary.|$|E

Both of these seasons were released in the troublesome DVD-18 format which plagued many of Universal Studios' boxed set releases.|$|E
