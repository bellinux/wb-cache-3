50|$|Established in 1980, the Institute specializes {{mainly in}} {{improving}} the performance of gas lasers, especially excimer lasers. Between 1990 and 2005, the Institute developed fiber <b>disk</b> <b>lasers,</b> <b>disk</b> <b>laser</b> (active mirror)and the concept of power scaling. Ultra-low loss mirror was developed aiming application for high power lasers (1995).|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of fiber}} laser is the fiber <b>disk</b> <b>laser.</b> In such lasers, the pump is not {{confined}} within the cladding of the fiber, but instead pump light is delivered across the core multiple times because the core is coiled on itself like a rope. This configuration is suitable for power scaling in which many pump sources are used around {{the periphery of the}} coil. [...] Fiber <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> have exceptional protection against back reflection compared to traditional fiber <b>lasers.</b> Fiber <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> can be used for welding and cutting applications requiring more than 1000 watts of power.|$|R

The results for continuous-wave and pulsed operation as well as for amplification of short (ns) and ultra-short (ps, fs) pulses demonstrate the potential of the thin <b>disk</b> <b>laser</b> design. The advantages for operating different laser materials will be explained and also the applicability of the thin <b>disk</b> <b>laser</b> concept to optically pumped semiconductor structures will be discussed.

50|$|In floppy disks, the {{lubricants}} {{inside the}} plastic jackets of many older floppies promote {{the decay of}} the magnetic medium. Also, the alignment of the magnetic particles of the disk substrate may gradually degrade, leading {{to a loss of}} formatting and data. Early <b>laser</b> <b>disk</b> media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to peel apart, damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.|$|E

Over the same period, the firm ran a number of interactive video courses at Cambridge colleges, through the Universities Extension Centre (UEC), later called Cambridge Interactive. In 1991, Intersearch Systems Ltd merged with Cambridge Interactive to become the Cambridge Multimedia Group plc.|$|E

50|$|Solid-state lasers {{operate at}} {{wavelengths}} {{on the order}} of 1 micrometer, much shorter than gas lasers used for welding, and as a result require that operators wear special eyewear or use special screens to prevent retina damage. Nd:YAG lasers can operate in both pulsed and continuous mode, but the other types are limited to pulsed mode. The original and still popular solid-state design is a single crystal shaped as a rod approximately 20 mm in diameter and 200 mm long, and the ends are ground flat. This rod is surrounded by a flash tube containing xenon or krypton. When flashed, a pulse of light lasting about two milliseconds is emitted by the <b>laser.</b> <b>Disk</b> shaped crystals are growing in popularity in the industry, and flashlamps are giving way to diodes due to their high efficiency. Typical power output for ruby lasers is 10 - 20 W, while the Nd:YAG laser outputs between 0.04 - 6,000 W. To deliver the laser beam to the weld area, fiber optics are usually employed.|$|E
50|$|Other Americans include Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Tony Oursler. Bill Viola is {{considered}} {{a master of the}} medium. His 1997 Survey at the Whitney Museum in NY, along with the 1994-95 Gary Hill survey created by the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle, and traveling to Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles and Kansas City, amounted to a watershed mark in the history of video installation art marking both a period on the sentence of the first generation and a beginning of the next. Gary Hill, another master of the medium, has created quite complex and innovative video installations using combinations of stripped down monitors, projections and a range of technologies (from <b>laser</b> <b>disk</b> to DVD and new digital devices) so that the spectator can interact with the work. For instance in the 1992 piece Tall Ships, commissioned by Jan Hoet for Documenta 9, the audience enters a dark hall-like space where ghostly images of seated figures are projected onto a wall. The approach of a viewer causes a seated figure to stand up and move forward toward the viewer, creating an eerie effect of the dead in the underworld (rather suggestive of Odysseus' descent into the Underworld in The Odyssey). Tony Oursler's work exploited the technology developed in the early 1990s of very small video projectors that could be built into sculptures and structures as well as improvements in image brightness so that images could be placed on surfaces other than a flat screen.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of software for {{an element of}} Multimedia Database Management Systems (DBMS) is addressed in this work.

50|$|First <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> were {{developed}} in the Institute for Laser Science, Japan.Several realizations of fiber <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> were reported. The fiber <b>disk</b> <b>laser</b> is so named because the fiber is tightly coiled.

40|$|In this talk, {{the latest}} results for thin <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> will be presented.

40|$|Optical {{emissions}} from the laser welding {{process can be}} obtained relatively easy in real-time. Such emissions come from the melt pool, keyhole, or plume during welding. Therefore it is very beneficial to establish a clear relation between characteristics of these emissions and the resulting weld quality or the ocurrence of welding defects {{for any of the}} laser ype currently used in industry. Most commonly used in continuous wave (CW) laser welding applications are the CO 2 laser, Nd:YAG <b>laser,</b> diode, <b>disk</b> and fiber <b>lasers.</b> The <b>disk</b> <b>lasers</b> are relatively new and need to be characterized with respect to the nature of their plasma or plume generation.

40|$|An {{optically}} pumped semiconductor disk laser with a double-band Bragg reflector {{mirror is}} presented.

An inverted epitaxial layer sequence allows the complete removal of the GaAs substrate after the semiconductor <b>laser</b> <b>disk</b> has been mounted onto a water-cooled microchannel heat sink.

In first experiments, a continuous single-mode optical output power of 3. 6 W has been achieved which was limited by the output power of the broad-area pump laser diode. 1...|$|E
