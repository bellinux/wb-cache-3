[...] Although simple and elegant, chabana has deep roots in {{the traditions of the}} more formal Ikebana forms, and has its place in both the minimalistic Shintoism and the austentatious Buddhism expressions. Cha means tea, and bana originated from hana meaning flower. This style comes with minimal rules and appeals to those who prefer a simple, natural look in their creation. Banmi Shofu Chabana is the standard style for chanoyu or the Japanese tea ceremony. Chabana, in all its simplicity, requires much skill. Favored flowers are camellias and magnolias, but other less classical and seasonal flowers may be used. A true chabana will evoke the season of the year or take the viewer to a peaceful spot in the woods. Bronze, ceramic, bamboo, or glass containers are usually small to fit easily on a tea ceremony table. When creating a chabana, the artist selects the container and the driftwood based on the seasonal flower and <b>line</b> <b>material</b> (if appropriate), thinking ahead that no kenzan or kubari are used. Chabana designs are appropriate outside the tearoom, such as many places in the home.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possible}} {{heat release}} rates of fires resulting from burning combustibles in 900 karaoke music compartments of 19 local karaokes were studied. Combustibles of concern are furniture foam, partitions and surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Equations {{appearing in the}} literature for calculating the heat release rates of these combustibles are used. Heat release rates of furniture foams were studied first, followed by igniting surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> classified under the Swedish system. The likelihood of flashover in those 900 karaoke music compartments was then investigated. Further, the total heat release rate curves for burning foam, surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> and carpets are studied using the results reported in the literature. Based on this study, it is recommended to select furniture foam with less heat release rates upon burning, and replace timber surface <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> as soon as possible. As an urgent action, a good fire safety management scheme “tailor-made ” for individual karaokes is to be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water temperature, in association with four denture cleansers, on the colour and surface roughness of five soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Method: Two silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> (Molloplast B and Sofreliner) represented the heat-cured, laboratory-based and chairside materials that are available. The wide range of chairside, acrylic resin-based, temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> was represented by Coe-Soft, Viscogel and Eversoft. An alkaline hypochlorite (Dentural) and three effervescent peroxide solutions {{with a range of}} active pH values (Steradent Active Plus, pH 6; Steradent Extra Strength, pH 3; Superdrug Fresh, pH 11) were selected as the cleansers. The denture cleansers were used at two temperatures: 55 °C (manufacturers' recommended temperature) and 80 °C. The colour of the specimens was evaluated using a colorimeter and the surface roughness was assessed using a three-dimensional, non-contact surface profilometer. This study reported on the effect of using both the higher temperatures and the recommended temperature on the colour and roughness of permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials.</b> Results and Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the temperature of the water used with denture cleansers might have a detrimental effect on the colour and surface roughness of some permanent and temporary soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{efforts have been}} made to {{overrule}} the General Electric case.

We are not unmindful of this decision nor the vigorous dissent of four justices in favor of overruling General Electric. We think, however, that in the absence of horizontal agreement among licensees, or any plan aimed at or resulting in industry wide price fixing, licenses with price fixing provisions fall within the orbit of the patent and need not run afoul of the antitrust laws.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the extent of candidal adherence to these materials compared with a commercially available soft <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> and an acrylic resin denture base. Material and methods. The experimental materials were constructed in a stainless-steel mold, and their surface energies were determined with a dynamic contact angle analyzer. The adherence of three strains of C. albicans was determined with an in vitro assay. In addition, one test strain was used to determine the effect on adherence of precoating the materials with whole saliva. Results. Adhesion to all materials was strain variable, with the lowest adherence recorded for the two experimental materials. Decreased adherence was also apparent after precoating the materials with saliva. Correlation between surface energy of the material and the degree of candidal adhesion was seen for one strain, but no correlation was seen for the other two strains. Conclusion. Adherence of C. albicans to the two experimental silicone soft <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> was significantly less than that for an acrylic resin denture base and a commercially available soft <b>lining</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R
