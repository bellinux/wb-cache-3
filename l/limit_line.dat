2500|$|Stop sign {{placement}} {{can pose}} an additional challenge to users. There is a trade-off between the salient visual cues provided by increased <b>limit</b> <b>line</b> set-back, and the crucial {{time that is}} lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the <b>limit</b> <b>line</b> causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes {{it very difficult to}} estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a <b>limit</b> <b>line,</b> which has a mandatory set-back distance which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop <b>limit</b> <b>line,</b> drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the [...] assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 February 2014, South Korean defense {{officials}} claimed that a North Korean warship repeatedly crossed into South Korean territorial waters overnight {{in spite of}} repeated warning. The alleged incursion occurred just as South Korea was joining the United States in bilateral Key Resolve/Foal Eagle 2014 military exercises. The incident {{was said to have}} occurred at the Northern <b>Limit</b> <b>Line</b> which North Korea disputes is a legitimate maritime boundary. [...] On 2 March 2014, South Korea {{defense officials}} reported that North Korea launched two additional short-range Scud-C missiles in the North's recent barrage of missile firings. [...] This latest incident took place prior to the arrival of four U.S. Aegis-equipped warships, a U.S. nuclear attack submarine, and the U.S. Seventh Fleet's flagship to South Korean ports for Exercise Foal Eagle 2014. [...] However, {{for the first time since}} 2010, North Korea agreed to allow re-union visits for families separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone after assurance from South Korea of the defensive nature of the 2014 Key Resolve/Foal Eagle exercises.|$|E

40|$|MIng (Nuclear Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{wall effect}} {{is known to}} present {{difficulties}} when attempting to predict the pressure drop over randomly packed beds. The Nuclear Safety Standard Commission, “Kerntechnischer Auss-chuss" (KTA), made considerable efforts to develop an equation which predicts the pressure drop over cylindrical randomly packed beds consisting of mono-sized spheres. The KTA was able to estimate a <b>limiting</b> <b>line,</b> which defines the region for which the wall effect is negligible, however the theoretical basis for this line is unclear. The goal {{of this investigation was}} to determine the validity of the KTA <b>limiting</b> <b>line,</b> using an explicit approach. Packed beds were generated using Discrete Element Modelling (DEM), and the flow through the beds simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). STAR-CCM+R was used for both DEM and CFD operations, and the methods developed for this explicit approach were validated with empirical data. The KTA correlation predictions for friction factors were com- pared with the CFD results, as well as the predictions from a few other correlations. The KTA correlation predictions for friction factors did not correspond well with the CFD results at low aspect ratios and low modified Reynolds numbers, due to the influence of the wall effect. The KTA <b>limiting</b> <b>line</b> was found to be valid, but not exact. A new <b>limiting</b> <b>line</b> for the KTA correlation was suggested, however the new <b>limiting</b> <b>line</b> improved little on the existing line and was the result of some major assumptions. In order to improve the determination of the position of the KTA <b>limiting</b> <b>line</b> further, criteria need to be established which determine how small the error in predicted friction factor must be before the KTA correlation can be accepted as accurate.
