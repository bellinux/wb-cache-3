30|$|There are {{two general}} {{approaches}} {{to prevent or}} minimize <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> problems. The first approach is called the preventive approach. This method can be used when the drill engineer anticipates that a <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> event may occur in a specific zone, but has not yet occurred. In this approach, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> can be prevented by adding materials to the mud that will seal fractures and strengthen the wellbore, therefore, preventing a fracture from further propagation or worsening the fluid loss. The second approach is called corrective <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> treatment and {{can be achieved by}} adding <b>materials</b> known as <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials.</b> When mixed with the mud, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> have the ability to plug the fracture and seal it if their particle size is big enough to do so. The type, shape, composition, size distribution and strength of the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCMs) can also be important to design an efficient solution treatment to address <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> (White 1956). In this paper, we propose a smart expandable material made out of shape memory polymers that can seal the fracture and strengthen the wellbore.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{problem of}} <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> {{have for a}} long time {{occurred}} during the drilling operation. During the drilling through induced and natural fractures, huge drilling fluid losses lead to the higher operational expenses. That is why, it is vital to design the drilling fluid, so that it may minimize the mud invasion in to formation and prevent <b>lost</b> <b>circulation.</b> Generally, the mud loss occurs in the cavernous and vugular formations, as well as naturally occurring or induced fractures, or fractures in permeable and low permeability formations. Historically, this problem was dealt {{with the help of the}} <b>Lost</b> <b>Circulation</b> <b>Materials</b> (LCM). These materials are added to the drilling fluid to seal the fractures and to increase fracture initiation or fracture propagation pressure. The <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> may be used in the form of pills, when the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> zone is identified. In some cases, solutions to <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> may be obtained by the pretreatment of the drilling mud with the particles of the proper material and with the proper particle size distribution. Subsequent treatment is also important, as a form of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> prevention, when the particles are efficiently added to the mud system in the correct size, shape and type. Understanding the mechanisms of fracture sealing and the performance of the <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> is critical if the problem of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> is to be mitigated effectively. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the performance of the chosen <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (i. e LC-Lube) in 60 / 40 and 80 / 20 oil/water ratio OBM mud systems. The bridging performance of LC-Lube was studied with the help of the bridging tests in the laboratory. The D 50 of the particle size distribution was 310 μm. The slot openings used in the bridging tests were 100 μm, 250 μm, 300 μm, 400 μm and 500 μm. The concentration of LC-lube additive were 16, 85 lb/bbl and 8, 49 lb/bbl. The results of the tests were compared and the performance of the bridging materials discussed and analyzed. The results have shown that the LCM performance in two different mud systems when it comes to bridging, was better with 60 / 40 OBM in the case of 250 μm and 300 μm slot openings and a concentration of 16, 85 lb/bbl. In the case of a lower concentration of the LC-lube, the performance with the 60 / 40 was as well better with the slot openings of 250 μm and 300 μm, although the difference was less pronounced...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringLost {{circulation}} {{has been}} and still is a cost factor for the drilling industry. By using <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> in drilling fluid, {{it is possible to}} mitigate unnecessary loss of drilling fluid. This thesis presents characterization, performance simulation and lost circulation performances of four types of oil based mud systems. These are of 60 / 40, 70 / 30, 80 / 20 and 90 / 10 oil-water ratio. The characterization part deals with rheology measurement and modelling at various temperatures, and is based on direct experimental measurements. The performance simulation study deals with the hole cleaning efficiency of the drilling fluids. The lost circulation part deals with the bridging performance of the drilling fluids at various simulated fracture widths. For the experiment, 13. 82 lb/bbl LC-lube (graphite) was used as <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material.</b> The results show that particle size distribution with a D 50 at or higher than the fracture width gives a better performance in terms of bridge strength.

The experimental works covered the rheological properties and lost circulation tests which were conducted before and after the hot-rolling tests as per API RP 13 B. Those tests involved the use of standard mud testing equipment and a lost circulation test cell. The optimum concentration of the durian rind-which had been cleaned, cut into small pieces, dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 hours, and ground into small fine particles-was determined before a performance comparison study was done on both Hydro-plug (i. e., a commercial <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material)</b> and durian rind of different sizes, namely fine (0. 5 mm), medium (1. 0 mm), and coarse (2. 0 mm). The experimental results showed that the durian rind worked well in combating the lost circulation. At its optimum concentration of 20 lb/bbl, the coarse durian rind was found to have performed excellently in combating lost circulation in 1 mm and 2 mm fractures. The standard rheological test showed that the rheological properties of drilling fluid were not too affected at standard temperature of 75 °F but they changed significantly after the hot-rolling tests. The change in rheological properties was due to the flocculation of bentonite and chemical reaction of the pectin in durian rind...|$|E

To achieve this, Lost Circulation Materials (LCM) are required {{which is expected to}} seal the fractures hence, the performance of Oyster Sea-shells (Crassostrea Virginica) as a <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> is being investigated knowing that it is rich in Calcium Carbonate. Sea shells were prepared, pulverized and sieved to obtain fine grain particles which were analyzed in the laboratory for various properties. A fractured zone lost circulation test procedure was employed using a medium-sized fracture at 1000 psi. pressure drop and temperature of 80 ºF. The tests were performed in triplicates and the rheological and gel strength results were obtained. It was seen that although the Oyster Sea shell is not a viscosifier, it passes API acceptability test for API acceptable range of Plastic Viscosity and Yield Point. The plastic viscosity and Yield point of the mud were compared to that of the VG Gel and the trend observed was a good indication that the Oyster Sea shell would support Wyoming bentonite. Locally sourced Oyster Sea-shell {{can be used as a}} <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> as its fine-sized grades performed excellently in controlling mud loss for the water-based mud in the laboratory.

40|$|This study aims to {{find the}} effect lost {{circulation}} materials has on cement slurries through testing in viscometer, pressurised consistometer and static gel strength analyser at selected concentrations. A worksheet containing a basic cement slurry recipe was used as basis for comparison against the slurries containing <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material.</b> SafeCarb 250, OptiSeal II, OptiSeal IV and G-Seal were the materials used to obtain the results for this thesis. The chosen concentrations for <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> were, by recommendation, 100 kg/m^ 3, 150 kg/m^ 3 and 200 kg/m^ 3. For the thickening time and compressive strength tests, only the highest and lowest concentrations were chosen. All three concentrations were used when conducting tests on the viscometer. The rheology of the slurries were tested in the viscometers subjected to surface and downhole conditions. It was found that OptiSeal II, containing both graphite and calcium carbonate, had 73, 5 % higher viscosity and 15, 24 % higher yield stress at surface conditions compared to the base slurry. G-Seal, containing coarse-sized graphite, had 100 % higher viscosity and 56, 4 % higher yield stress at downhole conditions. OptiSeal IV, a calcium carbonate, showed the overall lowest values compared to the base slurry with 28, 1 % lower yield stress at surface conditions, 32 % lower yield stress and 8, 36 % lower viscosity at downhole conditions. Thickening times were tested in a pressurised consistometer. Tests showed that the addition of SafeCarb 250, a calcium carbonate, decreased thickening time with 18 % as concentrations of SafeCarb increased. Compressive strengths were tested in a static gel strength analyser. All materials containing calcium carbonate achieved a higher compressive strength than the base slurry. OptiSeal II was 47, 5 % higher than base slurry on the highest concentration.

3000|$|Case 1 Seepage mud loss: For {{permeable}} rocks (excluding {{those with}} highly fractured preexisting fractures), once the mud pressure {{applied in the}} borehole {{is greater than the}} formation pore pressure (p mud > p), the mud will invade and flow into the formation through pores due to high permeability. This is the seepage mud loss, which can easily happen in permeable sandstones and limestones, particularly for the low pore pressure or depleted reservoirs. Seepage mud loss is a slow mud volume escape or loss into the formation through porous materials or small holes. Therefore, seepage loss in most cases is minimal (normally, the loss < 10  bbl/h for oil-based mud and < 25  bbl/h for water-based mud). This will have little effect on the drilling operations. Since the seepage mud loss is mainly caused by the connected pores or by formation permeability, <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> (LCM) pills can be used to block the flow path.|$|E

30|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{has been}} a serious problem while drilling {{that may lead to}} heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and lost mud fluid. In severe cases, it can lead to well blowout with serious environmental hazards and safety consequences. Despite extensive advances {{in the last couple of}} decades, lost circulation materials used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal large fractures or plugging drilling tools. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> (LCM) to remotely control the expanding force and functionality of the injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of shape memory polymers that become activated by formation’s natural heat. Once activated, these particles can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The activation temperature of the proposed LCM can be adjusted based on the formation’s temperature. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the sealing efficiency of these smart LCMs as a proof of concept study. Various slot disk sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2 have been followed as standard testing methods to evaluate this product.|$|E

Lost circulation technology development for geothermal drilling has been in progress at Sandia National Laboratories for more than 15 years. The initial work centered on lost circulation materials, but testing and modeling indicated that if the aperture of a loss zone is very large (larger than the drill bit nozzles) it cannot be plugged by simply adding materials to the drilling fluid. Thus, the lost circulation work evolved to include: (1) Development of metering techniques that accurately measure and characterize drilling fluid inflow and outflow for rapid diagnosis of los circulation and/or fluid balance while drilling.

30|$|Drilling fluid losses into {{fractured}} shales {{is a major}} challenge. <b>Lost</b> <b>circulation</b> {{treatments are}} widely applied to mitigate the losses; however, {{the effectiveness of these}} treatments is affected by different physical properties of the used <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCM). This paper presents an experimental investigation to study the effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution, temperature, and LCM shape on the formed seal integrity, with respect to differential pressure, at different fracture widths. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the over consolidated Barents Sea overburden. Three commonly used LCMs that vary in size were used to formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of nine LCM blends. Nutshell blends effectively sealed different fracture widths with high seal integrities. Examination of the formed seal under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope revealed that this performance is due to the irregular shapes of these materials as well as their ability to deform under elevated pressure. Based on the results, it has been found that to effectively seal fractures using granular LCM treatments, the D 90 value should be equal or slightly larger than the anticipated fracture width. However, due to both the increased risk of plugging downhole tools and the availability of larger LCM, granular LCM treatments can only be used to seal fractures up to 2000  microns. With the current limitations, other unconventional treatments are required to seal fractures wider than 2000  microns.|$|R

Designing the fluid requires {{a good understanding of}} sealing mechanisms and all the parameters affecting the sealing performance. Laboratory testing apparatus is the key concept for LCM evaluation ensuring successful treatment. The high-pressure test cell containing fracture discs is an effective tool among the broadly designed apparatus. A variety of formulations has been developed from the LCM physical properties. Recently, the testing conditions such as the slot wall angles and the fracture disc thickness were found to have significant effects on the evaluation results. However, the effect of the base fluids, fluid density, types of weighting materials and aging conditions has not been addressed. In this study, two different base fluids, water-based fluids and oil-based fluids, were used to compare the base-fluid effect. Drilling fluid density was raised up using barite and/or hematite to investigate the effect of the weight agents. Barite was sieved to study the effect of fine particles on the sealing. Finally, the dynamic aging tests were conducted in LCM-treated WBF using two temperature levels (200  °F and 400  °F) and two aging periods (24 and 72  h). The results showed that the base fluids affected the sealing performance depending on the complex interaction between the solid particles and the fluids. Adding weighting agents tended to improve the seal integrity. Adding proper size of fine particles improved the LCM sealing performance. Aging conditions affected LCM properties depending on the thermal stability of the materials.|$|R
40|$|Drilling fluid losses into {{fractured}} shales {{is a major}} challenge. <b>Lost</b> <b>circulation</b> {{treatments are}} widely applied to mitigate the losses; however, {{the effectiveness of these}} treatments is affected by different physical properties of the used <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCM). This paper presents an experimental investigation to study the effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution, temperature, and LCM shape on the formed seal integrity, with respect to differential pressure, at different fracture widths. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the over consolidated Barents Sea overburden. Three commonly used LCMs that vary in size were used to formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of nine LCM blends. Nutshell blends effectively sealed different fracture widths with high seal integrities. Examination of the formed seal under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope revealed that this performance is due to the irregular shapes of these materials as well as their ability to deform under elevated pressure. Based on the results, it has been found that to effectively seal fractures using granular LCM treatments, the D 90 value should be equal or slightly larger than the anticipated fracture width. However, due to both the increased risk of plugging downhole tools and the availability of larger LCM, granular LCM treatments can only be used to seal fractures up to 2000 microns. With the current limitations, other unconventional treatments are required to seal fractures wider than 2000 microns...|$|R
40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{is one of}} {{the drilling}} operational problems. It refers to the total or partial loss of drilling fluid into highly permeable zones or natural or induced fractures. This problem is likely to occur when the hydrostatic head pressure of drilling fluid in the hole exceeds the formation pressure. Today, managing lost circulation remains a significant challenge to oilwell drilling operations because it may contribute to high non-productive time. It is imperative to note that the overbalance pressure situation also can cause the invasion of mud filtrate into production zones which will result in formation damage. To address these problems, an experimental investigation has been done on durian rind as an alternative fluid loss and lost circulation materials in water-based mud. Durian rind was selected as a mud loss control material because it contains close to 20 % pectin which may complement the formation of high quality mat-like bridges across openings of the formation. The test involved the use of standard mud testing equipment and a lost circulation test cell. Durian rind powder was prepared by cleaning and cutting the durian rind into small pieces of 1 to 2 cm, and then dried them in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours before grinding into five different sizes from coarse to ultra-fine while Hydro-plug, the commercial <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>material</b> was supplied by Scomi Energy. The fluid loss test was conducted using a standard low pressure filter press while the bridging test was carried out at 100 psi of pressure difference and ambient temperature using a lost circulation cell. Fine durian in the water-based mud gave the best fluid loss control compared to coarse durian rind, fine and coarse Hydro-plug. The experimental results also showed that at 15 lb/bbl (42. 8 kg/m 3) optimum concentration, coarse and intermediate durian rind have outperformed Hydro-plug by showing an excellent control of mud losses in 1 and 2 mm simulated fractures...|$|E

Low pressure-bearing capacity of a plugging zone will result in excessive consumption of <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> (LCMs) and extra down time. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on the plugging of millimeter-wide fractures to evaluate the plugging effects {{of different types of}} LCM including rigid granules, elastic particles and fiber. Maximum plugging pressure, total loss volume before sealing and plugging time were taken as the evaluation index of the LCM plugging effect. According to the experimental results, the synergistic plugging mechanisms of different LCM combinations were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the total loss volume of the plugging zone formed by rigid and elastic particle combination was generally greater than 400  mL, and the maximum plugging pressure of the plugging zone formed by elastic particle and fiber combination was generally less than 6  MPa. In contrast, the plugging zone formed by the combination of the three types of LCMs has the maximum plugging pressure of up to 13  MPa and total loss volume before sealing of 75  mL. In the synergistic plugging process, rigid granules form a frame with high pressure-bearing capacity in the narrower parts of the fractures; elastic particles generate elastic force through elastic deformation to increase the friction between a fracture and a plugging zone to make the plugging zone more stable; fibers filling in the pore space between the particles increase the tightness and integrity of the plugging zone.

40|$|AbstractEliminating or {{controlling}} <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> during {{drilling process}} is costly and time-consuming. Polymers {{play an important}} role in mud loss control for their viscosity due to their high molecular weight. In this paper, three natural cellulosic polymers (carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum and potato starch) were investigated as <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> control <b>material</b> by measuring different filtration parameters such as; spurt loss, fluid loss and permeability plugging tester value according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard. The experiments were conducted in a permeability plugging apparatus (PPA) at a differential pressure of 100 and 300 psi, using 10, 60 and 90 ceramic discs. From the obtained data, it was found that the 0. 1 % from the carboxymethyl cellulose exhibited the best results in the filtration parameters among 0. 3 % guar gum and 0. 6 % potato starch. At the same time the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) enhanced the rheological properties of the drilling mud better than the two other used natural polymers in the term of gel strength, thixotropy, plastic and apparent viscosity. These results were discussed in the light of the adsorption and micellar formation...|$|R
30|$|LCMs work {{in such a}} {{way that}} {{particles}} in the mud increase in size in order to plug the pores and cracks that mud alone cannot seal (White 1956). Materials should have certain characteristics to be used as a LCM, which are briefly discussed in API standards 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2. For instance, if the size of the particles is too small for the given fracture width, the particles will flow through the fractures and particle bridging may never occur. Similarly, if the size of the particles is too big, the particles will not be able to enter the fracture, and therefore, sealing may not take place. Therefore, the size of the material particles and their distribution are very crucial for a fast and proper sealing of fractures. The materials should also be able to adapt to a wide range of environments, temperatures and pressures. The seal formed by the LCMs should be able to withstand mechanical forces that come from drilling mud, erosional forces that come from the moving particles in the mud as well as hydrodynamic forces that come from swab and surge (Cook et al. 2012). <b>Lost</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>materials</b> can be classified as fibrous, flaky, granular types or a mixture of the three types. The LCM can be effective if the bridge it forms inside the fracture can withstand all the forces mentioned earlier. In order to make sure that the LCM seals the fracture effectively, researchers have come up with theories to maximize the chance of bridging. Bridging of particles is defined as the buildup of solids that reduces inflow. Various jamming or bridging theories are available, and their main goal is to predict bridging time. Abrams (1977) proposed two rules to minimize formation damage due to <b>lost</b> <b>circulation</b> and mud invasion. The first rule suggests that the average particle size (D 50) of the bridging materials or LCMs should be equal or slightly larger than a third of the average formation pore size. The second rule suggests that the LCM concentration should not be less than 5 % by volume of the total solids in the mud formation. Whitfill (2008) proposed an alternative approach to optimize bridging considering fracture width instead of pore throat sizes. The average particle size of the LCM should be equal to the fracture width to make sure that the fracture is effectively plugged.|$|R
