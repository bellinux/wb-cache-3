40|$|Abstract. Intelligent text <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems {{need the}} {{capability}} {{to deal with the}} semantics of the content of their text bases. In order to satisfy this requisite it is necessary to extract semantic information from the documents {{and to be able to}} make inferences about it. A methodology to semi-automatically transform a traditional web IR system into a semantic aware one is proposed. The methodology is composed by three major steps: construction of an appropriate semantic ontology; text enrichment with semantic information; and construction of the inference engine. In order to create an adequate ontology, natural language processing techniques are applied, such as, partial parsers and lexical information (WordNet). Documents are enriched with semantic information using the output of the partial parsers and the obtained ontology. Finally, an inference engine based on a declarative programming language – Prolog – is used as the basis for the reasoning process. An application of this methodology to the <b>legal</b> web <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> system of the Portuguese Attorney General’s Office is described. ...|$|R

50|$|Boolean searches, where a user may specify {{terms such}} as use of {{specific}} words or judgments by a specific court, {{are the most common}} type of search available via <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> systems.

50|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Retrieval</b> {{attempts}} {{to increase the}} effectiveness of legal searches by {{increasing the number of}} relevant documents (providing a high recall rate) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high precision rate).

50|$|Overcoming these {{problems}} can be made more difficult {{because of the large}} number of cases available. The number of legal cases available via electronic means is constantly increasing (in 2003, US appellate courts handed down approximately 500 new cases per day), meaning that an accurate <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> <b>retrieval</b> system must incorporate methods of both sorting past data and managing new data.|$|E

The development of usable retrieval mechanisms and representation methods for juridical documents with the integration of Internet/Intranet technologies such as Java, HTML, search engines and SGML into the application is the central topic of this case study and thus provides an effective solution for making an unsystematically grown body of law visible and comfortably accessible again.

In spite of this, users of European <b>legal</b> <b>information</b> encounter multitude of problems in <b>information</b> <b>retrieval.</b> The <b>information</b> is scattered in numerous databases in which documents are organised and classified in different ways, their contents are written in different languages, and the functionality and user interfaces of the databases differ.
