5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} fracture scale length and aperture on seismic wave propagation through seismic physical modelling. The physical models are constructed from a solid background of epoxy resin with inclusions of silicon rubber chips which come with different radius and thickness to simulate fractures with different scale length and aperture. The chips embedded in each model are of the same radius and thickness, and the fracture density is kept constant for all models {{in order to understand}} the effects of the scale length and aperture. P and S waves that propagate parallel and perpendicular to the fractures are then recorded using a pulse transmission method. The experimental results show that given the same fracture density the changing of radius has an only minor <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> P-wave velocity and amplitude, and there are also <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shear-wave amplitudes. The main observable effect is an increase of the slow shear-wave velocity with radius, leading to a decrease in shear-wave splitting with radius. The changing of fracture thickness has also <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shear-wave amplitude except an obvious decrease in the slow shear-wave velocity, leading to an increase of shear-wave splitting with thickness. However, the increasing in fracture thickness induced a strong attenuation in the P-wave, in particularly for P-wave propagating perpendicular to the fracture. These findings may be useful for differentiating the effects of thin microcracks and large open fractures...|$|R

However, inhibition of miR- 122 decreased both HCV RNA and HMGCR RNA with <b>little</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rates of HCV and HMGCR RNA synthesis.

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme {{is not involved in}} the control of the pathway.|$|E

As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E

Several hours after being classified a depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Andres.

By the morning of June22, very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center, and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature. Favorable conditions, warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline.
