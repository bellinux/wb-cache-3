40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} a two-stage aggregation disaggregation model based on THRUPUT 2 (Morton, Rosenthal and Lim, 1995), a mobility optimization model {{used to analyze}} the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to conduct airlifts in support of major military operations. For a given fleet of aircraft, a given network of routes, and a given set of unit movement requirements over time, THRUPUT 2 schedules airlift to minimize late deliveries and non-deliveries. The linear programming model presented is based on THRUPUT 2, but aggregates those units which share the same origin-destination pair and have overlapping time periods and therefore creates a smaller <b>linear</b> program. This <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>size</b> will consequently decrease the time needed to solve, which is desirable because repeated runs of this model are necessary to generate analytic insight and develop recommendations. The thesis further {{develops a}} disaggregation model which will remove the aggregations of the first, and therefore offer resolution similar to that of THRUPUT 2. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.
