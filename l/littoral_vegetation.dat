Construction started in 1530 at the instigation of the Lord of Zvíkov Castle, Kryštof ze Švamberku. Gradually the water area became overgrown with <b>littoral</b> <b>vegetation</b> consisting mainly of reeds, and this valuable vegetation covered approximately 40% of the Řežabinec area. However excessive fish production, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, resulted in damage to the protected area and extinction of many species. Nowadays reed coverage has declined to approximately 15% of the Řežabinec pond area. As of 2011, the pond is state-owned and managed by Agentura pro ochranu krajiny ČR, which seeks to restore species diversity and minimize negative human impact.|$|E

The data were compared with results from Chabařovice Lake, Czech Republic, where similar monitoring took place in 2007 – 2010 and 2012. In shallow water of Římov Reservoir, the density of egg strands was significantly higher in grass bays compared to both rocky bays and the main reservoir body. Most egg strands were deposited in water less than 0. 5 m deep on reed canarygrass Phalaris arudinacea. In year when the <b>littoral</b> <b>vegetation</b> was absent perch were forced to spawn significantly deeper on various types of woody structures.

A detailed survey of hydro-hygrophilous vegetation {{was carried out in}} 2010 - 2012. Three multimetric indices were calculated: the MacroIMMI (the Italian macrophytic index for mid-size subalpine lakes with a maximum depth < 125 m), the SFI (Shorezone Functional Index), and the LHS (Lake Habitat Survey). The MacroIMMI (0. 76) classified the lake in a good ecological status, although the dominant aquatic species were exotic (Elodea nuttallii and Lagarosiphon major). The SFI pointed out that the 50 % of total shorelines displayed a very good or excellent conservation status; conversely, the LHS revealed high levels of morphological alteration coupled with rather good levels of habitat diversity, likely due to the high colonization rates of macrophytes along the lake shore. The lacustrine multimetric indices seem suitable for assessing the conservation status of mid-size lakes.

40|$|Bowfin (Amia calva) are {{the last}} living members of Amiiformes and {{considered}} a living fossil. This robust predator’s habitat is expanding in Oneida Lake, New York concurrently with increasing summer water temperatures and water clarity following the introduction of zebra mussels. Greater water clarity has led to more luxuriant growth of <b>littoral</b> aquatic <b>vegetation,</b> providing a more favorable habitat for bowfin. Given Oneida Lake is near the northern extent of the species’ range, understanding the influence of ecological changes on population dynamics could aid in predictions of similar shifts taking place on a larger geographic scale. While the bowfin has not been highly regarded as a sport fish, there is an increasing group of dedicated anglers and additional interest by some in producing bowfin caviar in southern territories. Little {{is known about the}} ecology, behavior or population biology of bowfin. The focus of the ongoing study described here is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behavioral, population and reproductive dynamics of the bowfin in Oneida Lake by employing radio telemetry.

The overall surgical survival rate was at least 94 % if discounting transmitter loss or malfunction and 83 % of the fish continued to actively transmit thus far in the study. The success of field surgery was most associated with minimizing latency of the procedure. Sterility should be maintained as best possible with the unique tissue characteristics of fish in mind. In addition to this paradigm study, a comprehensive review of aquatic anesthesia, surgery and telemetry is provided.

40|$|THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS ON FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FOOD WEB INTERACTIONS IN LAKE ONTARIO EMBAYMENTS Kristin K. Arend, Ph. D. Cornell University 2008 Aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are influenced by}} physical, chemical, and biological processes operating at multiple spatial scales, from landscape through microhabitats. Processes operating at the landscape level, such as watershed land use or precipitation, are external factors that influence an aquatic ecosystem. Internal factors are processes operating on an aquatic ecosystem from within the system, such as habitat. I explored how external and internal factors influenced fish community structure and function in Lake Ontario embayments. With my research, I aimed to address the following questions: (1) which internal and external factors influence how much and where biomass is distributed in the fish community (i. e., structure); (2) which factors influence energy sources utilized by the fish communities (i. e., function); (3) are structural and functional responses related to each other? Structural characteristics responded to both external and internal factors. Biomass increased with phosphorus loading (external factor) and area (internal factor), whereas abundance increased and size structure decreased with percent vegetation (internal factor). Similarly, both external and internal factors influenced energy sources incorporated by the fish communities, including connectivity to adjacent habitats (external factor), depth profile (internal factor), and vegetation (internal factor). Fish communities in embayments with stronger connections to their watersheds (versus Lake Ontario) incorporated greater energy and nutrients from the watershed, and vice versa. Fish communities in deep embayments relied primarily on energy sources from pelagic habitat; fish communities in shallow embayments utilized energy sources from both pelagic and littoral habitats. Finally, structural and functional responses appeared to be related through their effects on trophic interactions, as indicated by a study of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) populations. A comparison of observed yellow perch growth versus energy budget model predictions suggested that embayment morphometry could influence {{the relative importance of}} trophic interactions. Yellow perch populations in shallow, <b>littoral</b> embayments, where <b>vegetation</b> provides protection from predation, were sensitive to prey availability and composition. In contrast, yellow perch growth and size structure in deep, pelagic embayments might have been influenced to a greater extent by predation. Overall, internal factors influenced fish communities {{to a greater extent than}} external factors, primarily by influencing trophic interactions.

A total of 137 plant species, of which 115 herbs and 22 trees and shrubs, were recorded on these relevés. The records included two stronngly endangered species: Lysimachia thyrsiflora and Lycopodiella inundata. The biotopes hosted 51 wetland species and 20 ruderal species...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to design the {{sampling}} method for collection of phytophilous macroinvertebrates associated with submersed parts of hard emergent <b>littoral</b> <b>vegetation</b> in still waters, which will join technical sampler unpretentiousness, sampling simplicity and maximal quantitative accuracy. For these purposes, we developed a modified Gerking´s frame box sampler with movable cutter for sampling of animals in the littoral macrophyte beds and a new type of core sampler for collection of animals inhabiting the root zone of emergent plant beds. Both sampling devices are suitable for studies targeted on macroinvertebrates monitoring. The comparative sampling using frame box sampler and benthos handnet was performed in the littoral of three carp ponds. The sampling procedure utilizing the frame sampler was more labour demanding however it enabled significantly (P < 0. 05) more efficient collection of slowly moving or sedentary animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} and spatial variation of diatom assemblage in surface sediments of Caco Lake (shallow, mesotrophic and weakly acid lake - Maranhao State, Brazil) were analyzed {{in order to}} know the distribution pattern of the species along the lake during rainy season (April 1999). Four zones were established in the lake based on 21 diatoms species and habitat affinities. The first three zones (prime three meters deep to six meters deep) were marked by the occurrence of Pinnularia gigas, Frustulia rhomboides, Encyonopsis krasskei, Eunotia camelus, E. femoriformis and E. monodon. Zone IV (seven to nine meters deep) was inhabited mainly by Surirella biseriata and Fragilariforma floridana. During {{the beginning of the}} rainy season, the diatom assemblage in Caco Lake was composed mainly by benthic and epiphytic forms that reflected the low lake levels and the abundance of <b>littoral</b> <b>vegetation</b> present in this lake...|$|E
40|$|Littoral zones with {{emergent}} vegetation {{are very}} narrow or even lacking in Dutch shallow lakes {{due to a}} combination of changed water level regime and unfavorable shore morphometry. These zones are important as a habitat for plants and animals, increasing species diversity. It has also been demonstrated that littoral zones can act as a nutrient sink to improve water quality. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how these zones can be restored or created and if they can be effective in this sense. The results presented in this thesis give more insight in the functioning of littoral zones at different water level regimes and in the quantative aspects of several nutrient retention processes. Furthermore, the research revealed that it is possible for artificial littoral zones to become comparable to more mature zones in nutrient cycling and nutrient retention within 10 - 15 years. Two important factors were identified as crucial in determining nutrient cycling in the <b>littoral</b> zone. Reed <b>vegetation</b> strongly affects nutrient storage during the growing season and was shown to decrease nutrient concentrations in the soil. Furthermore, in vegetated sites nutrient accumulation in the soil was higher compared to sites devoid of reed. The second steering factor in a littoral zone is water level (regime). Processes like reed growth, organic matter accumulation and denitrification were influenced by water level. Reed biomass was stimulated at high spring water levels, more organic matter was accumulated under flooded conditions and denitrification rate was positively correlated to water level. In formerly saline lakes, like lakes in the IJsselmeer area and Lake Volkerak, reduced plant growth is likely to occur when salinity reaches high levels after drawdown. In that situation reed biomass will mainly grow in the deeper parts of the littoral zone. From these results it is concluded that relatively high water levels will increase nutrient retention processes in the littoral zone. At a more natural water level regime with a large amplitude, (temporarily) flooded conditions will prevail in a more extensive area. At local scale the results imply a significant nutrient retention in the vegetated part of the littoral zone. However, a modelling study pointed out that in a lake with high nutrient loading, a relatively large marsh surface area is necessary to reduce nutrient concentrations effectively at the whole-lake scale. In lakes where nutrient concentrations are reduced to around critical values or in lakes where concentrations are already low, littoral zones are able to make the difference between a turbid and a clear lake. From this study I can conclude that a more natural water level regime is favorable for the expansion of helophyte zones and that these zones play a role in improving water quality in lakes were nutrient concentrations are not excessively high. At the same time, expanding these zones will contribute to the ecological status of the lake and will help to comply to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive...|$|R

40|$|Created lakes are an {{end product}} of {{phosphate}} mining in Florida. Beginning in 1975, Florida reclamation rules set criteria for phosphate created lakes aiming to approximate {{the structure of}} natural lakes, and emphasizing extensive littoral zones with both emergent and submersed vegetation. Lake development relative to lake age and design were examined for 22 phosphate lakes representing a 40 -year age trajectory, utilizing water quality and benthic invertebrate communities from littoral and deep-water locations (Chapter 1). The relative importance of morphometry and lake age {{in the development of}} littoral plant communities was examined using multiple vegetation surveys throughout the year, in a separate investigation of 39 littoral locations from 13 lakes reflecting age and morphometry gradients (Chapter 2). The same littoral locations were used to investigate benthic community composition in relation to emergent and submersed plant habitats (depth of 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m respectively), water quality, sediment characteristics, morphometry and lake age (Chapter 3). Phosphate lakes 3 ̆e 5. 5 m deep are warm monomictic water bodies, stratifying from April to October/November, and developing thermoclines at approximately 4 m. Shallow lakes (3 ̆c 5. 5 m deep) are polymictic. Phosphate lakes become eutrophic or hypertrophic immediately after creation and remain so through time. Unlike reservoirs, they do not go through a trophic surge, which is an initial period of great productivity that declines as sediment nutrient storage is exhausted. Among the 22 sampled lakes, epilimnetic physical and chemical water quality variables (Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, turbidity, pH) did not differ along the age trajectory. Only specific conductance declined significantly, 10 - 20 years after lake creation, most probably due to bank stabilization. All water quality variables were within the range of natural lakes in the region, and were most similar to urban rather than suburban or rural natural lakes. Benthic invertebrate abundance (total, Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, invertebrates other than Chironomidae and Oligochaeta) and taxa richness displayed great variability with lake age and did not differ among decadal lake groups at any depths examined (1 m, deepest point). Invertebrate abundance did not differ between littoral and deep habitats, except for lakes 3 ̆e 10 years old, where littoral abundance was greater than deep-water abundace, suggesting faster colonization of the littoral zone. Littoral taxa richness was greater than richness in deep-water, which was attributed to taxa other than Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. Deep-water and most littoral habitats were dominated by Chironomidae, whereas Oligochaeta were occasionally dominant in the littoral zone. Dissolved oxygen was the variable explaining most variance of both littoral abundance and richness. Littoral macrophyte communities in phosphate lakes differed from natural Florida lakes. Although most phosphate lakes developed emergent <b>littoral</b> zones, submersed <b>vegetation</b> was absent, with few exceptions of the non-indigenous Hydrilla verticillata. Plants clustered in groups reflecting their hydrological designations. Frequently encountered plants classified either in the obligate wetland plant group, characterized by Typha, and inhabiting mostly intermediate-age lakes or the facultative wetland plant group, characterized by Panicum repens. Most plants in the latter group were bimodally distributed in youngest and oldest lakes, whereas few plants were ubiquitous. Littoral plant community composition was determined by both lake morphology and age, but the relative influence of these two components was not clear. Littoral plant composition was a good predictor of lake development. Morphometric (slope) and sediment characteristics (organic content, particle size) did not differ between the two littoral depths examined (0. 5 m and 1. 5 m). Slope correlated moderately but significantly with lake age, and organic content was low in all samples. Total littoral benthic invertebrate abundance and its major component Chironomidae, started from low values at newly created lakes and remained low or increased unpredictably with time. Total, Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Gastropoda abundances did not differ between the depths of 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m, whereas taxa richness and the abundance of invertebrates other than Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, and Gastropoda was greater at the shallower depth (0. 5 m). The relative effect of lake morphology versus age on benthic invertebrate composition was not clear. Total and Chironomidae abundance increased with lake age at 0. 5 m, and bank slope at 1. 5 m. Both littoral invertebrate abundance and richness in phosphate lakes were lower than in a natural, mesotrophic, macrophyte-dominated lake in the region, characterized by great Oligochaeta densities...|$|R
