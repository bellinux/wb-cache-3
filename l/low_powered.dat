25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Low self-discharge NiMH battery (LSD-NiMH) in 2005 made rechargeable AA and AAA sized batteries more viable for powering LED bicycle lights. Previously, the self-discharge effect of NiCAD and NiMH batteries caused the battery to run down {{over a period of}} weeks or a few months, even when not in use. This was particularly a problem for <b>low</b> <b>powered</b> LED lights, and for users who only used their bicycle lights occasionally. The LSD-NiMH battery greatly reduced the self-discharge effect, allowing the battery to keep its charge for a year or more.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pneumatic}} siren, {{which is}} a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with holes in it (called a chopper, siren disk or [...] ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes {{on the outside of}} the unit (called a stator). As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound. [...] Such sirens can consume large amounts of energy. To reduce the energy consumption without losing sound volume, some designs of pneumatic sirens are boosted by forcing compressed air from a tank that can be refilled by a <b>low</b> <b>powered</b> compressor through the siren disk.|$|E
