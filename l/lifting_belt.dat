50|$|Other {{equipment}} used can include a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> {{to support the}} torso and boards to wedge beneath the ankles to improve stability and allow a deeper squat (weightlifting shoes also have wooden wedges built into the sole {{to achieve the same}} effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term. The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Using {{a weight}} <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> when {{performing}} {{a variety of}} resistance exercises {{is becoming more and}} more common. The purpose of using a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> is its supposed ability to reduce compressive forces on the lumbar spine and enhancement of athletic performance. Although the weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> has been proven to increase the intra abdominal pressure that helps reduces the shear forces during a squat, little is known about the weight lifting belts effect on the performance. Studies have suggested that wearing a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> during a squat can increase the vertical velocity and range of motion. Few studies have focused on the power output, but improvements have been seen while wearing a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> when performing a deadlift. Variables such as power, velocity and range of motion are of importance for an athlete when making individual training plans as well as measuring the progress. Therefore more research is needed to identify the actual influence of the weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> on the performance. Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine if weight lifting belts have an impact on an athletes ability to develop power, velocity or improve range of motion in a squat. Methods: Fifteen healthy men and women familiar with the squat exercise participated in the study. During the study they performed six repetitions of the squat divided into two sets, one set without a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> and one with a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt.</b> Power and velocity were measured during every squat with a linear encoder and videotapes were made to later calculate the angles in the hip- and knee joints at the lowest position of the exercise. Results: No significant differences were found in power (p = 0. 25) or concentric and eccentric velocity (p = 0. 61, p = 0. 16) with or without a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt.</b> Range of motion in the knee joint was greater when not wearing a weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> (p = 0. 03), but no differences in the hip angles were found (p = 0. 70). Conclusion: The result from the current study shows that when performing a squat the weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> has little to no effect on power, velocity or range of motion. Although a noticeable change in range of motion of the knee joint were observed, further studies on larger populations are needed to determine if it is of clinical value. ...|$|E

50|$|Back belts, or {{lumbar support}} belts, are {{generally}} lightweight belts worn around {{the lower back}} to provide support to the lumbar. Industrial back belts tend {{to be similar to}} weight <b>lifting</b> <b>belts</b> or special belts used in medical rehabilitation therapy. Back belts are popular among workers across a number of industries—airline baggage handlers, warehouse workers, grocery clerks, etc.—specifically to prevent lifting injuries.|$|R

40|$|Whether or not lifting belts protect {{workers from}} injury {{is a topic}} of {{considerable}} interest in industry. Not only is the protective effect uncertain, but the biomechan-ical basis for belt function is unclear. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if lifting belts provide a means for controlling trunk motions during asymmetric material-handling tasks. We recruited 16 nursing personnel as experienced lifters to participate in two lifting sessions. A <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> was worn in one session and for a week prior to this session during the subjects ' routine work activities. Each session required 42 lifts, distributed across three asymmetry conditions (0, 45, and 90 deg) and temporally spaced 30 s apart. Foot motion was not permitted in half the lifts. Results indicated that during lifting, lateral bending and twisting mo-tions were reduced by both the <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> and foot motion; the most pronounced effect was observed at 90 deg of asymmetry. Trunk motions in the sagittal plane during lifting were not affected by the <b>lifting</b> <b>belt.</b> These results appear to support the use of lifting belts in asymmetric lifting conditions, but more research is needed to determine whether the muscles in the torso benefit from the reduced motion or are working harder to overcome this resistance to motion, causing in-creased internal loads on the spine during asymmetric material-handling tasks...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a lifting device for attachment to handling machines comprising a <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> running round a support, thus permitting a direct lifting of any object, in particular those with flat surfaces. The lifting device {{is characterized by}} a constructional shape which is easy to produce and easy to use. This is obtained by designing the support (2) of the lifting device {{in the form of a}} small hollow body comprising a cylindrical lifting wall (6) and a flat bottom wall (7) opposite said lifting wall, the lifting wall (6) being bent so that said lifting device is large enough to surround the drive elements located in the support (2) and the bottom wall (7) and the lifting wall (6) meet, forming flat wedge-shaped edges...|$|E
40|$|Lifting {{has been}} the subject of {{research}} for many years. The reasons that triggered this interest in lifting are its believed association to low back pain on one hand and to its usefulness in muscle training, rehabilitation and technique enhancement on the other hand. Even though the area of lifting biomechanics is saturated with studies, there still is no agreement on most aspects of lifting and in particular, the safest lifting technique, contribution of intra-abdominal pressure (lAP), use of lifting belts. Previously, there was some effort by some researchers to give some conservative recommendations. With the publication of many recent studies, it was important to review them in light of the previous ones in the hope of reaching some solid implications. After the review, it was clear that definite recommendations are not at hand yet specifically in terms of lifting technique, <b>lifting</b> <b>belt,</b> or the contribution of lAP in lowering loads on the lumbar region. The only obvious factor that was in agreement by almost all researchers is the superiority of the use of dynamic biomechanical models in estimating lumbar loads compared to static ones. Based on this review, more research is still needed before definite recommendations are reached. In the end, some implications are suggested in both the ergonomic and sports areas...|$|E

40|$|Megadoor {{has noted}} that many {{customers}} are asking for an alternative way to open their door when the regular opening function for some reason cannot be used. It is primarily customers from the aerospace industry that have pointed out {{how important it is}} that their doors can be hoisted whether the belt has been ruptured or the engine is malfunctioning. To meet these requirements Megadoor are looking for a solution that should be completely independent. This report describes a proposal on how the problem could be solved. For each of the three belt driven door models 3110, 3116 and 3190 a concept has been developed. They are all based on the same principle which is that the door can be hoisted with wire ropes integrated into the existing structure. This emergency system is designed to be offered as an optional function to standard doors. The emergency system is equipped with separate engine and gearbox, which will be selected based on customer needs. For model 3110, a manual option for hoisting the door is also suggested. The result is an integrated emergency system that will not be dependent of the <b>lifting</b> <b>belt</b> or the engine from the ordinary opening system. To be able to mount the emergency system on 3116 and 3190, the doors need to have a total width of at least 7, 2 meters. On model 3110 the emergency system will work regardless of width. The emergency system can be mounted on all belt driven models without affecting the ordinary opening function of the door. Validerat; 20160821 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

50|$|A {{conveyor}} furnace uses a flexible metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators <b>lift</b> the <b>belt</b> and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The {{conveyor furnace}} can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the conveyor furnace is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the treated soil exits the conveyor furnace, it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control. As of February 1993, only one conveyor furnace system was currently in use for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soil. This system is mobile and can treat 5 to 10 tons of soil per hour.|$|R

As the box is slowly closed, a bar <b>lifts</b> the <b>belt</b> material up against the material to be rolled, simultaneously pressing it against the rolling paper and packing it more tightly, and also causing the portion of the belt with the lower edge of the rolling paper to roll around outwards, forming the cigarette or joint. When the closing motion is complete, the finished cigarette or joint is ejected {{through a hole in the}} top of the box.|$|R
