40|$|There is a {{substantial}} theoretical literature on the potential effects of <b>loyalty</b> <b>contracts,</b> but a relative paucity of empirical work. This Paper employs the event study methodology to {{examine the effect of}} exclusionary contracts on firm performance in the ocean shipping industry. Shipping conferences - legal cartels exempt from antitrust laws - offered discounts to customers that patronized exclusively cartel member firms. The usage of these contracts was the subject of an extended legal and political struggle. We test for the impact of the most important events in this conflict on the stock returns of firms in the shipping industry. We find that some of these events resulted in significant changes in the firms’ stock returns. Our evidence suggests that exclusive contracts may have contributed to market power in the shipping industry. Event Study; Exclusive Contracts; Shipping Conferences...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of the}} following article: Marín, P. L. and Sicotte, R. (2003), Exclusive Contracts And Market Power: Evidence From Ocean Shipping. The Journal of Industrial Economics, 51 (2), 193 – 214, which has been published in final form at: [URL] is a substantial theoretical literature on the potential effects of <b>loyalty</b> <b>contracts,</b> but relatively little empirical work. We employ the event study methodology to examine the competitive effects of exclusionary contracts in the ocean shipping industry, where they were {{the subject of an}} extended legal and political struggle. We find that {{some of the most important}} events in this conflict caused significant changes in shipping firms' stock returns, indicating exclusive contracts increased their profits. We then examine the effect of these events on net exporting industries' stock returns, and provide evidence that these contracts contributed to carriers' market power. The research was supported by Spanish MCYT project SEC 1999 - 1236 -C 02 - 02 and the Newcomen Society. Publicad...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{organizational}} theories {{suggest that}} there is a tradeoff between loyalty and competence. This paper tests several such theories in the context of public agencies. Prime ministers, chancellors, and kings alike need to secure the (efficient or inefficient) loyalty of their agencies, such as support in important policy proposals or low corruption. They are also interested in agencies’ levels of competence. I find that governments have highly competent officials in their agencies (1) where officials have few private sector contacts, (2) where officials can extract few bribes, (3) where careers in agencies are expected to be long-lasting, and (4) where the agencies are powerful, i. e., where their loyalty is important. This set of findings fits best with a theory of loyalty as a noncontractible behavior, implying that too competent staff cannot be induced to loyalty unless loyalty is highly valued by the government. Other theories are either rejected or are less plausible because they cannot explain the complete set of observed regularities. <b>Loyalty,</b> self-enforcing <b>contracts,</b> public agencies, corporate finance...|$|R
40|$|Two of the {{widespread}} definitions of corruption are “dishonest exploitation {{of power for}} personal gain ” and “extreme immorality or depravity”. Corruption is usually conceptualized in the former way and also the “power ” is conceptualized as political not economic power in this definition. While the state is held responsible for corruption, private sector is immune of responsibility. It is argued that if the market is let to function through its own mechanisms, the state having undertaken a minimum regulatory role, good governance could be realized. Governance, the “magical ” word of current political economy, is ideologically grounded upon a narrative of previous mismanagement of economy. This assumes the economic sphere to be a sphere of equal opportunities. Then ethical responsibilities are reduced to the <b>loyalty</b> to <b>contract.</b> However, we will argue, the contract itself might be corrupt. In this study a critical stance towards the anti-corruption “crusade ” {{of the last decade}} will be followed, and corruption will be evaluated within a wider ethical frame that does not only focus on corruption involving state power but also on corporate corruption. Studying the implications of neo-liberal reforms on social rights, the paper aims to rebuild the relation between neoliberalism, governance and corruption...|$|R
50|$|New Keynesian {{economists have}} sought to explain {{persistently}} high unemployment in industrialized economies. New Keynesians explain part of this excess supply {{in the labor market}} with real wage rigidities that hold wages above market clearing levels. Economists have three main groups of theories for explaining real rigidities in the labor market: implicit contract theories, efficiency wage theories, and insider-outsider theories. New Keynesian economics is especially associated with the latter two. Implicit contract theory attributes stable real wages to implied agreements between employers and workers. Firms serve not just as consumers of labor, but also as wage insurers. By showing their workers that they will provide stable real wages, firms secure their <b>loyalty.</b> Seeing implicit <b>contracts</b> as a poor basis for real wage rigidities, new Keynesian economists sought other explanations.|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} general {{account of the}} rules that {{regulate}} exit and <b>loyalty</b> in <b>contract</b> disputes to make some fundamental points about the goals of contract remedies. The dominant goal of these rules, like all of contract remedies, is vindicating contracting rights. When contract rights give way it is almost always for one of two reasons. Rights sometimes give way to advance the goal of efficient performance. This goal is familiarly expressed by the mitigation principle and, in American contract law, by the theory of efficient breach. Rights also give way to advance the goal of remedial simplicity. In a nutshell, the rules that regulate exit and <b>loyalty</b> in <b>contract</b> disputes, like all of contract remedies, vindicate contract rights at the least cost and with the least fuss. This should be utterly unsurprising. More interesting are the trade offs made when these goals conflict. A contract right’s certainty is of crucial significance. I define a contract right as certain when {{the right to a}} performance from another is indisputable. There is an important distinction between the right to a performance and the worth of that performance to the right-holder. Often the right a performance is certain while its worth to the right-holder is uncertain. When a contract right is certain or indisputable contract law permits a right-holder to take a self-help measure, such as exiting from a contract, to avoid suffering an uncompensated loss even though the measure inflicts a disproportionate loss on the defaulter. In other words, the goal of vindicating rights trumps the goal of efficient performance when it comes to self-help remedies that do not unduly tax courts. More bluntly, the theory of efficient breach is bunk as a descriptive matter {{when it comes to the}} rules that regulate self-help responses to an indisputable default. The goal of efficient performance drives other aspects of contract remedies. Trivially, the mitigation doctrine and other rules compel a party to vindicate a right in the cheapest way possible. More interestingly, the goal of efficient performance explains the law’s response to loyalty in the face of contract uncertainty. By this I mean when a party performs a disputed obligation or accepts performance of disputed adequacy. I show that performance of a disputed obligation (or acceptance of performance of disputed adequacy) does not preclude the later assertion of a claim of a lesser obligation (or of a greater right), but only if performance (or acceptance of performance) avoids a loss. This point, which I believe is novel but seems obvious once you think about it, systematizes what now is a very tangled thicket of law. There is scant authority on the related question whether contract uncertainty warrants withholding or refusing performance. I think this is because courts have not had to confront the question directly. It tended not to arise under traditional common law rules, which made contract rights and obligations certain or unenforceable. This is changing. I highlight a fascinating decision by Judge Posner that confronts the question and answers that contract uncertainty does warrant exit, indeed his reasoning suggests uncertainty may require exit. Judge Posner is on to something important. However, putting the issue in a broader frame shows that the power to exit from an uncertain contract is cosseted by other rules that discourage exit when it would result in a consequential loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{model of}} white collar workers inhabiting offices {{to carry out}} their tasks is no longer valid in the 21 st century. Many employees now carry information with them and work while travelling, in hotels and at home. This is a relatively recent development, however, and since the information they carry with them is often sensitive, we have to consider how this new model impacts on the security of the organisation’s now distributed and potentially unsecured information. Whereas previously employees could relax within the company’s office space, they now cannot let their guard down since they are surrounded by strangers who are not bound by the same <b>loyalties</b> or employment <b>contracts.</b> How aware are mobile workers of the risks of mobile working? Situational Awareness is a concept that has been well known since its role in the development in aircraft design following World War One. It continues to inform studies on the use of mobile phones in cars and the role of distraction in pedestrian accidents.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how {{frequency}} of change (FC) in organizations and impact of change (IC) influence the employee behaviors, i. e. exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect (EVLN) through psychological contract fulfillment (PCF) as a mediator. The moderating role of successful past changes (SPC) is also assessed with direct and indirect relations of FC, and IC alongside employees’ behaviors. Design/methodology/approach – Hypotheses were tested among a sample of 398 financial services-oriented non-managerial-level employees in Pakistan. Bootstrapped moderated mediation analyses (using PROCESS macro) were conducted to test the main and moderated mediation effects. The authors ran series of confirmatory factor analyses to validate the distinctiveness of variables and their items in this study. Findings – The results largely supported the hypotheses. Findings showed that FC is negatively related to loyalty but positively related to exit, voice, and neglect behaviors via contract fulfillment. IC is also found to have negatively related to loyalty but positively related to exit, voice, and neglect via PCF. SPC was found to moderate the relation between FC, IC, and contract fulfillment, as well as the indirect relationship with exit, voice, and neglect through contract fulfillment and negatively between FC, IC, and <b>loyalty</b> through <b>contract</b> fulfillment. The authors found direct interaction effects of FC via SPC in relation to exit and loyalty and also found direct interaction effects of IC via SPC to exit, voice, and loyalty. Research limitations/implications – The use of cross-sectional research design does not allow conclusions with respect to causality. The most important implication of the study is that employee behaviors following organizational change can best be understood via a psychological contract framework. A future suggestion is to include more organizations based on longitudinal research design with focus on both employee and employer perspective. Practical implications – This study highlights the importance of employees’ behavioral responses and their sensemaking of PCF in a post-organizational change period. Originality/value – This study empirically investigated the effects of FC, and IC on fulfillment of psychological contract and behavioral responses of employees using a sample of non-managerial employees, and provides new insights into employee behaviors following organizational changes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} extent to which {{relationship}} marketing (RM) strategies were prevalent within the former NHS Internal Market and the determinants of such strategies. The research achieves its aims through the analysis of a postal survey of NHS Trust hospitals and District Health Authorities in England and case studies of the Warwickshire and Dudley health markets. The impetus for the research is the paucity of literature evaluating RM in the NHS context, resulting from the predominance of the traditional economics perspective on the purchaser - provider relationship. The latter is unable to systematically evaluate relational behaviour within quasi - markets given its adversarial contracting focus. Subsequently, the Relationship Marketing Paradigm is used to design a framework appropriate to evaluating relational oriented behaviour within the NHS Internal Market. To further investigate the determinants of NHS Trust hospital's RM strategies a series of hypotheses were developed and tested using Logit modelling techniques. These hypotheses sought to explain contract augmentation, <b>contract</b> customisation, <b>loyalty</b> discounting, default <b>contracting</b> and the use of cost - sharing contracts. In addition the case studies further examined the role of 'trust' within the purchaser - provider relationship through evaluation of contractual, competence and goodwill trust typologies. Equally, the case studies investigated the negative impact of RM strategies from the perspective of purchasers, providers and service users. The key conclusion is that RM was significantly more widespread than the literature suggests, indicating the centrality of relational oriented contracting. Furthermore, the nature of and determinants of the identified relationship marketing strategies were found to be mature and complex. Moreover, this weight of evidence questions Government policy's success in generating a competitive environment within the NHS Internal Market based upon adversarial contracting. To explore the likelihood of RM remaining an important phenomenon within the "new" NHS arrangements, evidence is drawn from the case studies and predictions from the Logit analysis...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{partnerships}} {{have become}} popular models in Finnish {{public and private}} sectors. Public-Private-Partnerships are new models in construction sector. In real estate sector owners have increased outsourcing facility services. This development has meant {{that the amount of}} partnership agreements have become bigger. Because of these facts also the interest of researching long-term contracts in the field of construction and real estate has increased. This research is a qualitative research which is carried by abductive logic. In this research long-term contracts in the field of construction and real estate are outlined in terms of contract law. The goal of the research is to find out: Which factors in terms of contract law have importance in mentioned long-term contracts? This is solved by examining literature, contracts and making theme interviews. This research contains next contract law mindsets: process concept of contract, relational contracting, dynamics of contract, proactive contracting and contractual risk management. These mindsets function partly as a background for the research and partly as a tool to outline mentioned contracts. The results of the research show firstly, what is contract management and how a company can with it arrange comprehensively it's contract policies and this way make it's business more efficient. Secondly the results show, what responsive contract is and how it can bring flexibility to long-term contractual relationships. The results also show, have trust and duty of <b>loyalty</b> in long-term <b>contracts</b> effect on parties. Also the results show how these mentioned three questions become apparent in practical contract policies in the field of construction and real estate. The results also show what the key elements in terms of contract law are in facility service partnership agreements. Research brings contribution to Finnish contract law and especially to the research of long-term contracts. On the other hand it brings contribution to construction economics and management by enhancing the importance of contracts as part of sector's business. Results create conclusions and recommendations to the construction and real estate sector...|$|R
