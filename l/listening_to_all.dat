25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the process}} of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> these {{alternative}} versions, Neil McCormick wrote: [...] "The Cutting Edge allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history, {{a new approach to}} song being forged before our very ears." ...|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{later found}} out that when the {{material}} was recorded, Wilson had taken LSD. [...] "I've {{tried to imagine what}} [...] must have been thinking", Zappa recounted, [...] "sitting in that control room, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> that weird shit coming out of the speakers, and being responsible for telling the engineer, Ami Hadani (who was not on acid), what to do." [...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love You To" [...] was {{the third}} track the Beatles {{recorded}} for Revolver, after [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get You Into My Life". Rodriguez comments that [...] "Love You To" [...] " [...] explicit the Indian influence implicit throughout the entire album", as songs such as [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to Get You Into My Life", together with the non-album single tracks [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and [...] "Rain", all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display the limited harmonic movement that typifies the genre. In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> sorts of things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, {{and most of it}} made its way onto our records." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, when it {{came time}} for Furtado to [...] "lay down the tracks" [...] for her third studio album Loose, she turned to hip hop {{producer}} Timbaland, who she previously collaborated with on the remix to Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On" [...] (2001) and on Ms. Jade's single [...] "Ching Ching" [...] (2002). Interscope Records president Jimmy Iovine played Furtado a few of Timbaland's latest productions, which she responded positively to. According to Furtado, [...] "It sound like he's <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the same stuff as me— everything from System of a Down to Bloc Party and Death from Above 1979, and a lot of Coldplay, too". [...] "Within no time", the two were working on music at The Hit Factory in Miami, Florida, alongside Timbaland's protege Danja. There, they produced ten of Looses thirteen tracks.|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{characterized}} {{his participation}} {{as a learning}} experience, and the experience was credited with profoundly changing his view {{on the relationship between}} the scientific community and the public. He had never been to a public hearing prior to his participation in the Shoreham commission, {{and he said that he}} had initially expected that the issues could be resolved by examining scientific data and establishing failure probabilities. However, he quickly became aware of the importance of the public participation process itself, stating that it was [...] "one of the rare opportunities for the public to feel they were being heard and taken seriously." [...] Marburger's conduct on the committee was praised by activists on both sides of the debate, with his focus on <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> viewpoints and his ability to not take disagreements personally being especially noted.|$|E

500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had better things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

[...] He added that in those early days, Kirwan [...] "was so into it that he cried as he played".|$|E
2500|$|Jay-Z {{says his}} {{earliest}} exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul {{artists such as}} Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says [...] "I grew up around music, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to." [...] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West-productions included on The Blueprint.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutors}} had also drafted an affidavit {{for the trial}} judge in response to Foster's motion for a new trial.

Upon picking of the jury after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of the jurors we had to pick, if we had to pick a black juror I recommend that [...] be one of the jurors." [...] The statement was crossed-out by hand and was omitted in the affidavit filed with the court.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} August, Lewis began {{selecting}} the track listing and approving the final audio mixes and masters of the songs. On 5 September 2012, Lewis used Twitter to communicate with Smith and inform {{him that she was}} approaching the end of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the final mixes. Lewis unveilled the final track listing for the standard edition on 9 September, naming twelve songs, but excluding the album's first single [...] "Collide". Smith confirmed that the final decisions had been made and that the album was 100% complete on 10 September. A two-disc deluxe edition was to be released alongside the standard version as per a Lewis question and answer session with fans. Thirty-second snippets of each song were released on 5 October. The album itself was released on 12 October in Ireland and 15 October in the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{became aware}} of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths {{sometimes}} crossed after Wynette's first minor hit [...] "Apartment #9" [...] in 1966, which was written by Johnny Paycheck. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends but eventually Jones {{took more than a}} passing fancy to Wynette, who was 11 years his junior and grew up <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of his records. According to his autobiography, Jones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife [...] "a son of a bitch." [...] Jones wrote: [...] "I felt rage fly all over me. I jumped from my chair, put my hands under the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. [...] Don's and Tammy's eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates." [...] Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the album's creation, Sugababes {{signed a}} US record deal with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation. The album was {{recorded}} by Sugababes mostly in Los Angeles and New York {{but as a}} producer liked them so much they {{did a couple of}} sessions in London. The group primarily worked with RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Fernando Garibay, up-and-coming production team the Smeezingtons (Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars). One of the album's tracks, [...] "No More You", was written by Ne-Yo. Keisha Buchanan compared the song to Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like our fourth member, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I think the one thing we wanted to do was come back with something different." [...] She also admitted the girls had become [...] "complacent" [...] around the time of Catfights and Spotlights but they also said that they are very proud of that album.|$|E
