40|$|In {{any point}} of the belt contact with the drum a {{relative}} speed compensation takes place that is carried out by a slippage even when the relevant contact spots are fairly clean and dry. This leads to heat generation that is being absorbed by both materials involved – by the belt {{as well as by}} the drum. Unlike the belt, the drum lagging would increase its temperature up to a certain limit that depends on number of factors. When the lagging surface temperature is reaching appx. 60 °C some structural changes in the <b>lagging</b> <b>material</b> take place and further rise of temperature can create a risk of belt inflammation and destruction of the driving unit.

The matching of different levels has {{a significant impact on}} the thermal protective performance, first the outer layer, then comfortable layer and thermal-protective coating. Although inherent fire resistant fiber for the main material of the outer fabric has better durability and thermal protective performance, the fire might experience obvious contraction which leads to embrittlements. For insulation flocculus, the ratio of aramid fiber 1313 and aramid fiber 1414 at 9 : 1 has excellent thermal insulation. For comfortable layer, inherent fire resistant fiber has no notable effect on the clothing’s overall thermal protection performance; the polysulfonamide fiber is a relative better choice...|$|R

Experiments with porous material impregnated with a flammable fluid have simulated the self-heating known to occur when combustible liquids leak from a hot pipe into lagging surrounding the pipe or are split from another source on to the lagging. A theory to explain these findings is presented which shows {{that there is a}} watershed temperature beyond which substantial self-heating will take place. Although the theory does not take account of diffusion, it simulates the main physics of the phenomenon—that is, combustible fluid, which normally in the open air would evaporate and not be a hazard, can, within a porous medium, remain dispersed within the porous structure long enough for the exothermic oxidation to develop into ignition. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at the design, {{construction}} and performance evaluation of a groundnut oil clarifier. The oil clarifier consists of two cylindrical tanks. The first tank {{was connected to the}} stirrer, bevel gear, pulley and motor while the second tank has a heating element and is insulated with a <b>lagging</b> <b>material</b> (rock wool). The machine was designed to clarify groundnut oil in order to improve its edible quality there by reducing its Free Fatty Acid, phospholipids, waxes, gums and some metal compound content in the oil and also eliminate the drudgery and constraints associated with the crude/traditional clarification methods. The performance of the machine was evaluated for the stirring, settling and heating time of the oil and the optimum operating conditions of rotational speed of the shaft and stirrer by degumming and neutralizing the crude groundnut oil with water and neutralizing reagents in the first tank after which is then transferred into the second tank via pump and pipe connections for heating so as to evaporate the available water to the required moisture content for safe storage.

40|$|The melting {{process of}} {{polyethylene}} glycol 1500 (PEG 1500) {{adjacent to a}} hot vertical wall in a rectangular enclosure is investigated experimentally. Polyethylene glycol 1500 was selected because its melting temperature is > 44 °C making it a suitable candidate as <b>lagging</b> <b>material</b> to prevent wax deposition and hydrate formation in subsea oil pipelines. A new apparatus cell consisting of a rectangular cell 200 × 200 × 180 mm split equally into three chambers by two, 2 mm thick, aluminium plates was constructed. Each end chamber was supplied with hot and cold water respectively. The centre chamber was filled with PEG 1500. Thermocouples and an infrared camera were {{used to measure the}} temperature at different locations inside and {{on the surface of the}} phase change material (PCM). The temperature contours, percentage (%) of melting and the melt front evolution are presented for various operating conditions. A dye tracer solution was used to show the natural circulation of the PCM as it melted. Results indicate that during the initial stage of melting heat conduction is the dominating mode of heat transfer, followed by transition from conduction to convection regime and convection dominating heat transfer regime. The results show a strong correlation between the hot wall temperature and the fraction melt as it control the convection heat transfer. In contrast, the results also show that cold wall temperature have insignificant effect on fraction of PCM melt with the time for constant hot wall temperature and the melt rate has a same characteristic shape for all cold wall temperatures used in this study. A dye tracer study shows the natural circulation in the liquid zone, confirm the presence of the strongest convection at the solid-liquid interface and reveal the velocity profile/current direction.

The terrain resembles a human brain. It is believed to be caused by cracks in the surface accumulating dust and other debris, together with ice sublimating from some of the surfaces.

40|$|A {{combination}} of low density and good heat resistance is desirable for many applications. Porosity {{is used to}} develop low density, and high porosity materials are frequently associated with low thermal conductivity. Materials that display this property, coupled with heat resistance, may be useful for thermal applications. Porous materials can exhibit several different structural types. In this work the structures that can be formed from fire resistant materials to reduce the density are considered as three different types. The first structure is represented by a recently-developed composite material, which was created by TWI, Abington, Cambridge, and has been given the trade name Barrikade™. This material combines granules of an expandable natural mineral, vermiculite, with a sodium silicate binder, to produce an inexpensive material with high porosity and heat resistance. The structure of this material {{is that of a}} coarse agglomerate of particles, with much of the porosity being incorporated in the interparticle spaces. Possible applications are wide ranging, including the core material in domestic or marine fire doors, and as a low cost <b>lagging</b> <b>material</b> for industrial furnaces. A second structural type that is that of a fibre mat. An array of fibres, bonded at points or held together solely by friction and surface forces of the fibres, may include high levels of porosity in the spaces between fibres. Materials with this structure are made from melt spun mineral fibres, and exhibit a high degree of heat resistance. The example of these materials studied herein is Rockwool®, often used for building insulation purposes. The third structural type considered here is often used where low density is required; a foam. Foamed structures can have many attractive properties, but the fire resistance of the foams considered here, closed cell aluminium foams, has been frequently predicted to be favourable, without being demonstrated in controlled tests. Where the material properties are not already known, the microstructure, mechanical performance, fire and temperature resistance, creep behaviour and thermal conduction and expansion characteristics of the materials have been determined. The aim of the work is the assessment and ranking of the materials’ suitability for different applications, and determination of the critical aspects for the design of such systems.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical leak indicators in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the pressuriser, and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size carburettor jets are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic pipe lagging, which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the <b>lagging</b> <b>material.</b> The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.

Typical bank stratigraphy charted on the Thailand side is imbricate cobble gravel overlain by 5 - 10 m of reddish-brown sandy silt. The silt section is composed chiefly of ½ to 2 -m thick layers of massive silt without paleosols interpreted as near-channel floodplain and gently-inclined levee deposits laid down by episodic, infrequent, large floods. The surface soil is dark-brown clay loam (La Na time. Brick ruins of 14 - 16 th Century Buddhist temples are crumbling into the river at Chiang Saen Noi, and formerly did so at Chiang Saen until banks were stabilized by rock walls. Bank retreat from river erosion has been 3 ̆e 20 m since La Na time, and has exposed a siltfilled moat. A radiocarbon age of 1475 cal yr AD was obtained from charcoal {{at the bottom of}} the moat, beneath 5. 6 m of silt. <b>Lag</b> <b>material</b> from erosion of the silt banks contains Neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts out of stratigraphic context, as well as ceramics and bricks of La Na age. These artifacts as well Neolithic artifacts obtained from a 1972 excavation near the mouth of the Kham River indicate long human habitation of this riverbank area. In northern Thailand the Mekong is mostly in a bedrock canyon, but shifting topography along the active strike-slip Mae Chan fault has formed the upstream 2 - 5 -km wide floodplain at Chiang Saen, and downstream has diverted the river into a broad S-shaped loop in the otherwise straight course of the river.

40|$|To {{understand}} how human tumor cells {{respond to the}} combined treatment with nocodazole and high LET radiation, alterations in cell cycle, mitotic disturbances and cell death were investigated in the present study. Human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were exposed to nocodazole for 18 h immediately followed by high LET iron ion irradiation and displayed a sequence of events leading to DNA damages, mitotic aberrations, interphase restitution and endocycle as well as cell death. A prolonged mitotic arrest more than 10 h was observed following nocodazole exposure, no matter the irradiation was present or not. The occurrence of mitotic slippage following the mitotic arrest was only drug-dependent and the irradiation did not accelerate it. The amount of polyploidy cells was increased following mitotic slippage. No detectable G(2) or G(1) arrest was observed in cells upon the combined treatment and the cells reentered the cell cycle still harboring unrepaired cellular damages. This premature entry caused an increase of multipolar mitotic spindles and amplification of centrosomes, which gave rise to <b>lagging</b> chromosomal <b>material,</b> failure of cytokinesis and polyploidization. These mitotic disturbances and their outcomes confirmed the incidence of mitotic catastrophe and delayed apoptotic features displayed by TUNEL method after the combined treatment.

40|$|Background: Amplification of 3 q 26 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic alterations in many human malignancies. Recently, we isolated a novel oncogene eIF- 5 A 2 within the 3 q 26 region. Functional study has demonstrated the oncogenic role of eIF- 5 A 2 in the initiation and progression of human cancers. In the present study, we aim to investigate the physiological and pathological effect of eIF- 5 A 2 in an eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model. Methods: An eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model was generated using human eIF- 5 A 2 cDNA. The eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mice were characterized by histological and immunohistochemistry analyses. The aging phenotypes were further characterized by wound healing, bone X-ray imaging and calcification analysis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated to further investigate molecular mechanism of eIF- 5 A 2 in aging. Results: Instead of resulting in spontaneous tumor formation, overexpression of eIF- 5 A 2 accelerated the aging process in adult transgenic mice. This included decreased growth rate and body weight, shortened life span, kyphosis, osteoporosis, delay of wound healing and ossification. Investigation of the correlation between cellular senescence and aging showed that cellular senescence is not required for the aging phenotypes in eIF- 5 A 2 mice. Interestingly, we found that activation of eIF- 5 A 2 repressed p 19 level and therefore destabilized p 53 in transgenic mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells. This subsequently allowed for the accumulation of chromosomal instability, such as errors in cell dividing during metaphase and anaphase. Additionally, a significantly increase in number of aneuploidy cells (p < 0. 05) resulted from an increase in the incidences of misaligned and <b>lagging</b> chromosomal <b>materials,</b> anaphase bridges, and micronuclei in the transgenic mice.

Based on simulations of the electrical behavior of such advanced devices, the requirements on simulation of doping profiles will be explained. To achieve the high dopant activation needed to reduce contact and channel access resistances, active concentrations if possible above solid solubility are required.

This phenomenon is caused by changing the water slope in the Pacific Ocean between Peru (northwestern South America) and Northern Australia (about Indonesia and Malaysia). ENSO phenomenon is formed of Elnino (warm state) and La Niña (cold state). There is high pressure system in the East and low pressure system in the West Pacific Ocean in normal conditions (Walker cycle). The trade winds blow from East to West with high intensity. ENSO start when the trade winds and temperature and pressure balance {{on both sides of the}} PacificOcean change. High pressure will form in the west and low pressure will form in the East. As a result, west will have high and east will have low rainfall. Temperature will change at these two locations. Enso longs about 6 to 18 months. This research investigated the impact of ENSO on monthly precipitation and temperature of Mashhad. The results showed that temperature and rainfall have a good relation with ENSO. This relation occurs in 0 - 5 month <b>lag.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: The severity of ENSO phenomenon is known by an index which is called ENSO index. The index is the anomaly of sea surface temperature in the Pacific. The long-term temperature and precipitation data of Mashhad selected and analyzed. The Rainfall has no trend but temperature has trend. The trend of temperature modeled by MARS regression and trend was removed. The rainfall data changed to standard and temperature changed to anomaly for comparison with ENSO index. The 2016 annual and monthly temperature of Mashhad is not available. The 2016 Annual temperature was forecasted by ARMA (1, 1) model. Then this forecast disaggregated to monthly temperature. For each period of occurring high ENSO, these three indexes (ENSO index, standardized rainfall and anomalies temperature) were compared. The co-variation of these indexes was compared. Also, the correlation and cross correlation for each period of occurring ENSO, with rain and temperature of Mashhad was calculated. Results and Discussion: Mashhad monthly temperature and precipitation were compared with the extreme values of ENSO index in periods of the occurrence this phenomenon (1950 - 2016). In addition, the correlation and cross-correlation between ENSO-Rainfall index and ENSO-temperature index for this period were calculated. Forecasted temperature for 2016 by ARMA (1, 1) was 13. 2 Degrees Celsius, which has 0. 2 degree increase in comparison to last year. Results showed thatthere is no an obvious relation between ENSO-Temperature and ENSO-Rainfall in interval (- 1, + 1). But there are good relation between ENSO-Temperature and ENSO-Rainfall beyond of (- 1,+ 1). The results of Elnino showed that the monthly precipitation and temperature increase with a lag of 2 to 5 months and 0 to 4 months, respectively. The results of Lanina showed that the monthly precipitation and temperature decrease with a lag of 3 to 5 months and 1 to 4 months, respectively. Also when ENSO index is located in the interval (- 1, + 1), there is no certain harmony with temperature and precipitation of Mashhad. Conclusions: The aim of this study was evaluating the effect of the ENSO phenomenon on monthly temperature and precipitation of Mashhad. Mashhad monthly temperature and precipitation, respectively, for 132 and 124 years were available. Precipitation was static and has no trend, but temperature was not static and has two changed (jumped) point in 1976 and 2000. MARS regression was used for patterning the process. Removing the trend was done by MARS model and the data was obtained without trend. Monthly ENSO index since 1950 from reliable websites worldwide (NOAA) was obtained. Mashhad monthly temperature data was animalized and precipitation data was standardized. This was performed for comparing Temperature and Rain with ENSO index. The effect of the ENSO phenomenon on Mashhad precipitation and temperature in both graphical and cross-correlation was performed. As a final result, there is a good relation with latency zero up to 5 months for temperature and precipitation of Mashhad beyond the interval (- 1, + 1). It cannot be claimed that after the phase of La Nina, El Nino must be entered and vice versa. This note is important for forecasting the temperature and precipitation of 2016 coming months. If ENSO index in the coming months, especially in autumn and winter, decrease and inter in La Nina phase, the winter will be cold with low rainfall...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{complements the}} existing literature on rock shelter geoarchaeology and site formation processes by presenting data from 10 granite rock shelters in a tropical rain forest environment. Geological, taphonomic, pedological, and archaeological data are {{used to assess the}} geomorphological evolution of rock shelters in the Ituri rain forest, Northeast Democratic Republic of Congo. Mechanisms of sediment production and deposition, soil formation, and related site formation processes were investigated. The implications for the preservation of archaeological materials and stratigraphic resolution are discussed. Rock shelters in the tropical environment of the Congo basin are formed by mechanical and chemical denudation of large granite boulders. The current geomorphological cycle of rock shelter formation and collapse dates to the late Pleistocene and may have been accelerated by anthropogenic forces. The sedimentary record includes in situ breakdown products from the rock shelter walls, while off-site sources are represented by a minor influx of colluvium. Soil-forming forces have acted on these matrices. Humans introduced charcoal, phytoliths, endocarps, shell, animal and human bone, as well as inorganic materials such as stone, ceramics, and metal. <b>Lags</b> of archaeological <b>materials</b> are common under driplines where fine sediments have been washed away and include artefacts of different ages. There is no evidence of extensive bioturbation, but limited disturbance by roots, burrowing animals, and termites has been documented. Although there is some horizontal and vertical movement of prehistoric artefacts, the post-depositional translocatio...|$|R
30|$|Physical input–output tables (PIOTs) {{provide a}} key {{decision-making}} framework for optimizing material utilization while reducing {{the environmental impacts}} associated with production in the economy. As the need for accurate accounting for material flows became evident in the 1990 s, PIOTs were conceived of {{as a way of}} integrating the strengths of Input–Output (IO) modeling with material flow analysis (MFA). The PIOT structure is derived from Economic Input–Output (EIO) models, but intersectoral flows are captured in physical units rather than monetary units. The first PIOTs were developed in the 1990 s (Gravgaard-Pedersen 1999; Konijn et al. 1997; Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006; Hoekstra 2010) and demonstrated the utility of PIOTs as a tool for analyzing the physical interdependency between economic sectors as well as the interactions of the economy with the environment. While several researchers have highlighted the potential for PIOTs for material tracking and benefits of inclusion of more IO data in physical units (Altimiras-Martin 2014; Hubacek and Giljum 2003; Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006; Duchin and Levine 2011; Merciai and Heijungs 2014), their adoption and development have <b>lagged</b> compared to <b>material</b> flow analysis (MFA) (Hoekstra 2010), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) analysis. The slow adoption of PIOTs is attributed to high compilation costs, lack of physical data at the appropriate aggregation levels, lack of reproducibility and continuity in available datasets along with limited applications demonstrating the use of PIOT (Hoekstra 2010). However, the limited applications are a consequence of the limited number of PIOTs available leading to a negative feedback cycle of lag in PIOT development.|$|R
40|$|Skin {{exposures}} to chemicals may lead, through percutaneous permeation, {{to a significant}} increase in systemic circulation. Skin is the primary route of entry during some occupational activities, especially in agriculture. To reduce skin exposures, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended. PPE efficiency is characterized as the time until products permeate through <b>material</b> (<b>lag</b> time, Tlag). Both skin and PPE permeations are assessed using similar in vitro methods; the diffusion cell system. Flow-through diffusion cells were used in this study to assess the permeation of two herbicides, bentazon and isoproturon, as well as four related commercial formulations (Basagran(®), Basamais(®), Arelon(®) and Matara(®)). Permeation was measured through fresh excised human skin, protective clothing suits (suits) (Microchem(®) 3000, AgriSafe Pro(®), Proshield(®) and Microgard(®) 2000 Plus Green), and a combination of skin and suits. Both herbicides, tested by itself or as an active ingredient in formulations, permeated readily through human skin and tested suits (Tlag <  2  h). High permeation coefficients were obtained regardless of formulations or tested membranes, except for Microchem(®) 3000. Short Tlag, were observed even when skin was covered with suits, except for Microchem(®) 3000. Kp values tended to decrease when suits covered the skin (except when Arelon(®) was applied to skin covered with AgriSafe Pro and Microgard(®) 2000), suggesting that Tlag alone is insufficient in characterizing suits. To better estimate human skin permeations, in vitro experiments should not only use human skin but also consider the intended use of the suit, i. e., the active ingredient concentrations and type of formulations, which significantly affect skin permeation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Steady, dihedrally {{symmetric}} patterns with sharp peaks may be observed on a spinning skirt, <b>lagging</b> behind the <b>material</b> {{flow of the}} fabric. These qualitative features are captured with a minimal model of traveling waves on an inextensible, flexible, generalized-conical sheet rotating about a fixed axis. Conservation laws are used to reduce the dynamics to a quadrature describing a particle in a three-parameter family of potentials. One parameter {{is associated with the}} stress in the sheet, aNoether is the current associated with rotational invariance, and the third is a Rossby number which indicates the relative strength of Coriolis forces. Solutions are quantized by enforcing a topology appropriate to a skirt and a particular choice of dihedral symmetry. A perturbative analysis of nearly axisymmetric cones shows that Coriolis effects are essential in establishing skirt-like solutions. Fully non-linear solutions with three-fold symmetry are presented which bear a suggestive resemblance to the observed patterns. Capturing the motion of a flexible sheet or solid membrane, be it only spinning about a fixed axis as embodied in a whirling skirt of fabric, presents challenges even in simulations [1]. The dynamics of its folds are typically observed as transient events. Yet the hypnotic ritual of the “whirling dervish”, credited to the 13 th century Persian poet and mystic Rumi, provides us with observations of emergent steady state patterns in this system. A survey of videos found on the internet (for example [2]) reveals unmistakable, if imperfect, stable configurations of skirts in a rotating frame. These a...|$|R
