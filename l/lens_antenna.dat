For historical reasons, a flat Fresnel zone antenna is termed a Fresnel zoneplate antenna. An offset Fresnel zoneplate can be flush mounted to the wall or roof of a building, printed on a window, or made conformal {{to the body of}} a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} on the Luneburg <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> is the hemispherical Luneburg <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> or Luneburg reflector antenna. This uses just one hemisphere of a Luneburg lens, with the cut surface of the sphere resting on a reflecting metal ground plane. The arrangement halves {{the weight of the}} lens, and the ground plane provides a convenient means of support. However, the feed does partially obscure the lens when the angle of incidence on the reflector is less than about 45°.|$|E
50|$|A Luneburg <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> {{offers a}} number of {{advantages}} over a parabolic dish. Because the lens is spherically symmetric, the antenna can be steered by moving the feed around the lens, without having to bodily rotate the whole antenna. Again, because the lens is spherically symmetric, a single lens {{can be used with}} several feeds looking in widely different directions. In contrast, if multiple feeds are used with a parabolic reflector, all must be within a small angle of the optical axis to avoid suffering coma (a form of de-focussing). Apart from offset systems, dish antennas suffer from the feed and its supporting structure partially obscuring the main element (aperture blockage); in common with other refracting systems, the Luneburg <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> avoids this problem.|$|E

The formulae and algorithms for predicting the radiation pattern of an offset Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> are presented in 4, where some experimental results are also reported. Although a simple Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> has low efficiency, it serves as a very attractive indoor candidate when a large window or an electrically transparent wall is available. In the application of direct broadcasting services (DBS), for example, an offset Fresnel lens can be produced by simply painting a zonal pattern on a window glass or a blind with conducting material. The satellite signal passing through the transparent zones is then collected by using an indoor feed.|$|E

50|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} Fresnel zoneplate antennas, one can divide each Fresnel zone into several sub-zones, such as quarter-wave sub-zones, and provide an appropriate phase shift in each of them, thus resulting in a sub-zone phase correcting zoneplate 5. The problem with dielectric based zoneplate <b>lens</b> <b>antenna</b> is that whilst a dielectric is providing a phase shift to the transmitted wave, it inevitably reflects some of the energy back, so the efficiency of such a lens is limited. However, the low efficiency problem for a zoneplate reflector is less severe, as total reflection can achieved by using a conducting reflector behind the zoneplate. Based on the focal field analysis, it is demonstrated that high efficiency zoneplate reflectors {{can be obtained by}} employing the multilayer phase correcting technique, which is to use a number of dielectric slabs of low permittivity and print different metallic zonal patterns on the different interfaces. The design and experiments of circular and offset multilayer phase correcting zoneplate reflectors were presented in 5.|$|E

It is demonstrated that if the relative dielectric constant of the lens is small (" r 4), the single- and double-reflected waves are sufficient to analyze {{the effect of the}} internal reflections. For small angles around boresight, these unwanted reflected fields mainly affect the cross-polar far-field pattern, while for large observation angles, both the co-polar and cross-polar patterns are significantly disturbed. It appears that by neglecting the internally reflected field contributions, the beam efficiency may be overestimated more than 10 %. In this paper, two types of matching layers are analyzed in order to reduce these unwanted reflections. It is demonstrated that the radiation performances of the integrated <b>lens</b> <b>antennas</b> with optimum-thickness and quarter-wavelength matching layer are almost equal.

The objective is to determine the best lens shapes that comply with given radiation characteristics. The first technique is a step-wise approach: the first step consists in solving the synthesis problem using Geometrical Optics (GO) principles, and, in the second one, the GO shape is optimized locally to fulfill the target specifications. This approach leads to an ill-posed problem and is only applicable to single-shell configurations. To overcome these limitations, an alternative technique consists of a global optimization of the ILA, using genetic algorithms (GAs) for instance.
