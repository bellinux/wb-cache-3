5|$|Artyom {{finds the}} Dark One, a child, but is {{captured}} by {{soldiers of the}} Fourth Reich. Pavel Morozov, a captured Red Line soldier, and Artyom escape through the Metro tunnels and across the devastated surface. When they reach the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red <b>Line</b> <b>forces</b> massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they are exposed to the virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
5|$|The first LRP patrol began {{during the}} Italian {{invasion}} of Egypt. 'W' Patrol commanded by Captain Mitford {{set out on}} 15 September 1940 {{to carry out a}} reconnaissance of Kufra and Uweinat. Finding no trace of the Italians, they turned south and attacked fuel dumps, aircraft and an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Kufra. 'T' Patrol, commanded by Captain Clayton, reconnoitred the main route between Kufra and Uweinat, then drove south to meet up with 'W' Patrol; both units returned to base, having captured two Italian trucks and official mail. The Italian response to these raids was to reduce their front <b>line</b> <b>forces</b> and increase the number of troops garrisoning the area from 2,900 men in September to 5,500 by November 1940.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} capture ocean wave energy and {{transform}} it into electric energy, Uppsala University has developed a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) for electricity production. For {{a better understanding of}} a torus shaped buoy’s performance, this paper conducts a force analysis under linear conditions, to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristic and <b>line</b> <b>force</b> differences between the torus buoy {{that is going to be}} deployed, and two similar cylindrical buoys. The result reveals the <b>line</b> <b>force</b> from this torus buoy is roughly 5 % larger than from cylindrical buoys for the most energy dense wave climate in Lysekil test site, and negative added mass phenomena won’t have a significant impact for the <b>line</b> <b>force.</b> To measure the <b>line</b> <b>force,</b> a force measurement system has been designed. A detailed description is given on the design of the 500 kN force measurement system, and the major differences compared with former force measurement systems. Onshore test result has also been presented. With the force measurement experiment, hydrodynamic analysis for torus buoy can be validated when the system performs linearly, and extreme force for storm weather can be monitored to provide information for future WEC structure’s mechanical design...|$|R

In the [...] "bad" [...] ending, Artyom destroys D6 to prevent Korbut {{from using the}} facility {{to wipe out the}} remnants of the other factions and possibly humanity, resulting in the deaths of himself, the surviving Rangers, and the Red <b>Line</b> <b>forces.</b> Later, Anna is shown telling their son of Artyom's bravery. In the [...] "good" [...] ending, later revealed as the canonical ending, Artyom prepares to destroy the bunker but is stopped by the little Dark One, who, along with the awakened Dark Ones, defeats Korbut's army. Artyom calls the little Dark One humanity's [...] "last light of hope". In both endings, the young Dark One leaves with the surviving Dark Ones to find safety, while promising that they will come back in the future to help rebuild the world.|$|E
2500|$|Mitford was {{promoted}} to captain and in September 1940, during the Italian invasion of Egypt, led his LRDG patrol [...] from Cairo deep into Libya on their first reconnaissance mission. The patrol crossed the Libyan Desert to the Jalo oasis and Kufra. It raided two enemy emergency landing grounds, destroying unguarded aircraft and {{a considerable amount of}} aviation spirit and a supply convoy carrying petrol and official mail. The effectiveness of this first patrol was reflected by the Italians having to reduce their front <b>line</b> <b>forces,</b> and reinforce the troops garrisoning the area, from 2,900 men to 5,500 by November 1940.|$|E

The proposed formulation is similar to Stroh’s formalism for anisotropic elastostatics in that the two-dimensional anisotropic elastodynamic problem is cast into a six-dimensional eigenvalue problem and the solution is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

2500|$|According to British {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor, Monash was [...] "the only {{general of}} creative originality {{produced by the}} First World War." [...] Monash's impact on Australian military thinking was significant in three areas. First, {{he was the first}} Australian to fully command Australian forces and he took, as following Australian commanders did, a relatively independent line with his British superiors. Second, he promoted the concept of the commander's duty to ensure the safety and well-being of his troops to a pre-eminent position applying a philosophy of [...] "collective individualism". And finally, he, along with staff officer Thomas Blamey, forcefully demonstrated the benefit of thorough planning and integration of all arms of the forces available, and of all of the components supporting the front <b>line</b> <b>forces,</b> including logistical, medical and recreational services. Troops later recounted {{that one of the most}} extraordinary things about the Battle of Hamel was not the use of armoured tanks, nor the tremendous success of the operation, but the fact that in the midst of battle Monash had arranged delivery of hot meals up to the front line.|$|E
2500|$|Confusion and {{miscommunication}} {{were not}} confined to the Southern forces, however; a botched order issued by General Rosecrans to one of his subordinates opened a large gap {{in another part of the}} Federal <b>line.</b> <b>Forces</b> under Longstreet quickly exploited it, turning the Federal right flank and crippling their defense. Rosecrans and much of his army fled the field, and only a desperate last-minute stand by Major General George H. Thomas saved the Union army from complete annihilation. The 33rd Alabama took part in a renewed assault on Kelly Field late in the afternoon, but due to its diminished numbers, it played little appreciable role in the final rout of Federal forces in that sector. [...] The Federals retreated all the way back to Chattanooga, where they awaited an immediate attack by Bragg's exultant army. Bragg, however, threw away the greatest victory in his career by dallying on the battlefield to collect left-behind equipment and tend to his wounded, rather than quickly pursuing and destroying the demoralized Federals. Upon reaching Chattanooga, Rosecrans' army quickly improved upon previous Confederate fortifications there; this would ensure their survival and the ultimate defeat of Bragg's forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of transportation {{in large cities}} requires the construction of twin tunnels located at shallow depth. As far as twin tunnels excavated in parallel are concerned, {{most of the cases}} reported in literature focused on considering the effect of the ground condition, tunnel size, depth, surface loads, the relative position between two tunnels, and construction process on the structural <b>lining</b> <b>forces.</b> However, the effect of the segment joints was not taken into account. Numerical investigation performed in this study using the FLAC 3 D finite difference element program made it possible to include considerable influences of the segment joints and tunnel distance on the structural <b>lining</b> <b>forces</b> induced in twin tunnels. The structural <b>lining</b> <b>forces</b> induced in the first tunnel through various phases are considerably affected by the second tunnel construction process. Their values induced in a segmental lining are always lower than those obtained in a continuous lining. However, the influence of joint distribution in the second tunnel on the structural forces induced in the first tunnel is insignificant. The critical influence distance between two tunnels is about two tunnel diameter...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>line</b> of <b>force</b> in Faraday's {{extended}} {{sense is}} synonymous with Maxwell's line of induction. According to J.J.
