50|$|Users can {{publicly}} (and anonymously, if {{the head}} instructor allows it) ask questions, answer questions, and post notes. Each question prompts a collective answer to which any user can contribute and an instructor answer, shown directly below, {{which can only}} be edited by instructors. Users are allowed to attach external files to posts, use LaTeX formatting, view a post's edit history, add follow-up questions, and receive email notifications when new content is added. The interface consists of a dynamic <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> {{on the left side of}} the screen, a central panel for viewing and contributing to individual posts, and an upper bar for account control. According to the company's data, the average Piazza question is answered within 14 minutes.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{view of the}} Twitter {{social network}} service for most users is the timeline, a heterogenous, reversechronological <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> from all {{connected}} authors. Previous tweet ranking and summarisation work has heavily relied on retweets as a gold standard for evaluation. This paper first argues that this is unsatisfactory, since retweets only account for certain kinds of post relevance.

30|$|Extra-curricular {{activities}} {{are an important}} part of learning and schools encourage student participation as part of the whole person development. Students do not only join these activities but also take part as organizers or leaders. When managing these activities, the required system needs to take into considerations of various forms of activities, a variety of posts for student leaders or organizers, level of attendance and participation of students, etc. To avoid having too many and inconsistent inputs to the system, the designers have all the posts of student leaders for all activities listed in the system for formulating teams systematically every semester. The comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> of all activities was resulted in good analysis of the user scenarios.|$|E
40|$|In 1982, Iowa's {{crossing}} warning {{identification system}} and signage at rail crossings were outdated, inconsistent and inadequate. Iowa's railroad system {{had been reduced}} and reorganized during the 1970 's {{and many of the}} surviving railroad companies were unable to install new signs or devote staff to updating information. The preliminary engineering part of this project improved the information inventory about each crossing, provided for installation of identification tags and resulted in a comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> and signs eligible for replacement. The sign installation portion of this project resulted in erection of nearly 10, 000 new crossbuck signs and 10, 000 advance warning signs with high intensity reflectorization. In addition, new posts and multiple track signs were replaced where appropriate. Increased visibility of crossings for the motoring public has resulted from proper sign placement and use of high intensity reflectorization. The tagging has provided a consistent correct identification of crossings for accident reporting. The computer inventory of information about the crossings is now correct and provides for informed decision making to administrators of Federal and State crossing safety funds...|$|E

C survives only in incomplete, seventeenth-century manuscripts.|$|R
