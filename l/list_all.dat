40|$|This {{paper is}} about: (1) bounds {{on the number}} of cliques in a graph in a {{particular}} class, and (2) algorithms for <b>listing</b> <b>all</b> cliques in a graph. We present a simple algorithm that <b>lists</b> <b>all</b> cliques in an $n$-vertex graph in O(n) time per clique. For O(1) -degenerate graphs, such as graphs excluding a fixed minor, we describe a O(n) time algorithm for <b>listing</b> <b>all</b> cliques. We prove that graphs excluding a fixed odd-minor have $O(n^ 2) $ cliques (which is tight), and conclude a $O(n^ 3) $ time algorithm for <b>listing</b> <b>all</b> cliques...|$|R

5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government {{and most of the}} states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species <b>list.</b> <b>All</b> captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} <b>list</b> <b>all</b> scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E
