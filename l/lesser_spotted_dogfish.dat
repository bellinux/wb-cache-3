25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E

The catch compositions of the fishery taking these species is described and analysed in terms of landings and discards. Only two of these species are sufficiently abundant to be recorded in the landings ({{blackmouth catshark}} and <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish).</b> The length compositions {{in terms of both}} landings and discards were analysed for these two species. <b>Spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> catches reached similar proportions to those of the target species in the coastal fishery (red and striped red mullet) and in the shelf trawl fishery (European hake); whereas the catches of blackmouth catshark and velvet belly were a small proportion of the total catch in the slope fishery for red shrimp. The size range of the <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> was between 7 and 53 cm TL. Juveniles and adults were distributed throughout the whole area, although adults appeared to be more abundant in the coastal zone. The length distribution of blackmouth catshark showed a trend of increasing size with depth; the size range was between 9 and 63 cm TL. For both species, individuals smaller than 35 cm TL were usually discarded. Only 25 % by number and 60 % by weight of the total <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> catch was landed. For the total blackmouth catshark catch, the corresponding percentages were 10 % by number and 35 % by weight. The role of these species as indicators of fishing pressure was investigated, taking into account {{the differences between the two}} fishing zones sampled, one with a fleet of 24 trawlers and the other with only 4 Publicado...|$|R

Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, knifetooth dogfish and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and sandy ray, while <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank.

The winter temperatures may have a direct effect on winter survival of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers by heat loss, whereas weather conditions during spring have an indirect effect on breeding performance by affecting food sources. In 2017, the UK population of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers {{was reported to have}} almost halved since 2009, to around 2,000.

Here, we show that juvenile <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Scyliorhinus canicula) also use this body armour to anchor food items near their tail so that bite-sized pieces can be torn away by rapid jaw and head movements. This scale-rasp behaviour is novel among fishes and suggests a new role for skin in the feeding ecology of sharks.
