Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million.

The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns.

Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued.

25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth resources that are enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and <b>liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. <b>Liquid</b> <b>assets</b> are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

Results indicate that economies of scale exist in a model that is stable over time. Interest rates have a strong and elastic impact on <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> demand when inflation is explicitly controlled for although this result is not consistent across all subsets of data used. The usual assumption of a unitary price level elasticity of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> demand is rejected and firms appear to conserve on <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holdings as the rate {{of inflation}} increases suggesting more careful management of payments flows.

25|$|A bank is a {{financial}} institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed {{either directly or indirectly}} through capital markets.

In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} {{transactions}} costs on the rates of return on <b>liquid</b> and illiquid <b>assets.</b> We consider an infinite horizon economy with finitely lived agents {{along the lines of}} Blanchard (1985). In this economy agents face a constant probability of death, and the population is kept constant by an inflow of new arrivals. Agents start with no financial wealth and receive a decreasing stream of labor income over their lifetimes. In addition they can invest in long term assets which pay a constant stream of dividends. There are two such <b>assets,</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> and the illiquid <b>asset.</b> The <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> is traded without transaction costs, while trading the illiquid asset entails proportional transactions costs. Neither asset can be sold short. Agents buy and sell assets for life-cycle motives. In fact, they accumulate the higher yielding illiquid asset for long term investment purposes and the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> for short term investment needs. We find that when transactions costs increase, the rate of return on the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> decreases, while the rate of return on the illiquid asset may increase or decrease. We also find, quite naturally, that the liquidity premium increases. The effects of transactions costs on the rate of return on the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> and on the liquidity premium, are stronger the higher the fraction of the illiquid assets in the economy. Finally, transactions costs have first order effects on asset returns and on the liquidity premium. We evaluate these effects for reasonable parameter values.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} a liquidity risk {{plays an important role}} in the current developed financial system. Some Hungarian and Polish banks suffered liquidity problems, too. This paper therefore aims to describe development of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratio and to find out determinants which affect their values in the Visegrad countries. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2011. Liquidity of Czech banks declined in 2000 – 2009 (due to higher lending activity and decrease of balances with central banks and other banks) but it has improved during last two years. Liquidity of Slovak banks has decreased in 2009 and 2010 due to impact of {{financial crisis}} on some economic sectors and due to changes in interbank market transactions. Very similar is the development of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratio in Hungary and Poland where it has gone down during last five years due to important structural weaknesses such as very high loan-to-deposit ratio, high share of foreign debts, and negative net position in the interbank market. Furthermore, we focus on determinants of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratio. Results of the panel data regression analysis showed that the <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratio is mostly influenced by the size of the bank, its capital adequacy and profitability. Also overall macroeconomic conditions, such as growth rate of gross domestic product, the existence of financial crisis, exchange rate or rate of unemployment and the development of interest rates (both on loans and interbank transaction) are important. Although the Visegrad countries have a lot in common, different factors determined <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratio in individual countries and also the direction of influence of some factors may differ...|$|R
