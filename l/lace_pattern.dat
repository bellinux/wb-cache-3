40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{evolutionary}} algorithms (EAs) to evolve and optimize <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns</b> of spokes for a bicycle wheel. There are multiple objectives and tradeoffs to be considered when evaluating a <b>lacing</b> <b>pattern,</b> for instance, strength versus balance. To handle this, an evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) method has been used. Various EMO algorithms and approaches are tested. Among these, the new NSGA-III algorithm is used. Different representations of the <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns</b> for the wheels are compared, and also two different representations of {{the problem for the}} EMO. A novel wheel simulator has been made to test the <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns.</b> As the number of needed wheel simulations take a considerable amount of time, the work is distributed among multiple computers. The EMO is successful in the search for good <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns.</b> One of the most common patterns, the 3 x, is found, along with other comparable patterns with different tradeoffs. The results show no improvement in using the new NSGA-III algorithm compared to the older NSGA-II. The representation with a bias for uniformly laced spokes let the EA evolve better wheels than other representations, showing that carefully choosing the representation for what is being optimized is important. The results also show {{how important it is to}} represent a problem using multiple objectives when possible, as the wheels evolved using a higher number of objectives were found to be best...|$|R

60|$|The Cork School of Art then {{acquired}} {{a collection of}} finely-patterned old laces, selections from which are freely circulated through the different convents connected with that school. They have also the privilege of borrowing similar specimens of old lace from the South Kensington Museum. So successful has been the system of education pursued by Mr. Brennan, the head-master of the Cork School of Art, that two female students of his school last year gained the gold and silver medals for their designs for laces and crochets at the national competition which annually takes place in London between all the Schools of Art in the United Kingdom. As for the many lace-makers who were not connected either with the convents or with the art schools, in order to assist them, a committee of ladies and gentlemen interested in Irish lace-making raised subscriptions, and offered prizes to be competed for by designers generally. The best designs were then placed out with lace-makers, and carried into execution. It is, of course, often said that the proper person to make the design is the lace-maker. Mr. Cole, however, points out that from the sixteenth century forward the patterns for ornamental laces have always been designed by decorative artists having knowledge of the composition of ornament, and of the materials {{for which they were}} called upon to design. <b>Lace</b> <b>pattern</b> books were published in considerable quantity in Italy, France and Germany during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and from these the lace-makers worked. Many lace- makers would, no doubt, derive benefit from practice in drawing, in discriminating between well and badly shaped forms. But the skill they are primarily required to show and to develop is one of fine fingers in reproducing beautiful forms in threads. The conception, arrangement, and drawing of beautiful forms for a design, have to be undertaken by decorative artists acquainted with the limitations of those materials and methods which the ultimate expression of the design involves.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Human {{designed}} physical patterns, {{while having}} been investigated extensively {{in terms of}} their historical, geographic and cultural significance and their aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have not been fully investigated {{in terms of their}} evolutionary potential. This paper discusses an experimental art research project which focuses on human designed, physical textile patterns to explore pattern as process and investigate the potential for these patterns to evolve and become emergent. The experimental art projects focused on lace and in particular, crochet <b>lace</b> <b>pattern</b> forms commonly referred to as doilies. 1 Crochet lace patterns are widely recognized, domestically produced hand-made physical patterns created from a low-technology repetitive manual process and located for the most part within a craft context. The project explored the developmental potential of these physical pattern forms by translating them into digital media and working in the digital environment. The research created crochet <b>lace</b> <b>pattern</b> simulacra {{in the form of a}} series of digital animations written in computer programming code that illustrate how digital crochet lace patterns form. This paper discusses the properties of lace that make it worthy of further investigation, the motivation behind the selection of crochet lace patterns, and explores the digital environment and its impact on the development of the crochet <b>lace</b> <b>pattern</b> forms. It then reports how the digital crochet lace patterns, when created in a digital environment and constructed using digital media and manipulated by computational processes, became a hybrid form – that is, an amalgam of human design decisions and computational processes. As such, the crochet lace simulacra epitomize the intersection of computational processes and human intervention which is common in the digital environment...|$|E
50|$|Lace made in Malta was {{originally}} needle lace, from the 16th to the 19th century, when the economic {{depression in the}} islands nearly led to the extinction of lacemaking there. But in the mid 1800s, Lady Hamilton Chichester sent lacemakers from Genoa to Malta. They used the old needle <b>lace</b> <b>patterns</b> and turned them into bobbin lace, which was quicker. It was not long after its introduction that the Maltese lace developed its own style from Genoese lace.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{a class of}} graph {{drawings}} that arise from bobbin <b>lace</b> <b>patterns.</b> The drawings are periodic and require a combinatorial embedding with specific properties which we outline and demonstrate can be verified in linear time. In addition, a lace graph drawing has a topological requirement: it contains a set of non-contractible directed cycles which must be homotopic to $(1, 0) $, that is, when drawn on a torus, each cycle wraps once around the minor meridian axis and zero times around the major longitude axis. We provide an algorithm for finding the two fundamental cycles of a canonical rectangular schema in a supergraph that enforces this topological constraint. The polygonal schema is then used to produce a straight-line drawing of the lace graph inside a rectangular frame. We argue that such a polygonal schema always exists for combinatorial embeddings satisfying the conditions of bobbin <b>lace</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{and that we can}} therefore create a pattern, given a graph with a fixed combinatorial embedding of genus one.

5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same <b>lacing</b> <b>pattern</b> on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns</b> on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various <b>lacing</b> <b>patterns</b> are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|R
