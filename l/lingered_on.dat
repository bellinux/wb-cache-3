5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical reminders of the trade.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti-aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 {{to the end of}} the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. Amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija was captured by the Italians after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, renamed Cattaro, and pressed into service with the Italian Navy. She was then captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in September 1943, and returned to her original name, Niobe. The ship ran aground in the Adriatic in December 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of British Motor Torpedo Boats. Niobe, Medusa, and Arcona were broken up for scrap in the late 1940s, but Amazone <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> as a barracks ship until 1954, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Italian naval {{budget was}} slashed; the cuts were {{so severe that}} the fleet had great {{difficulty}} in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, {{as part of the}} wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. As the Italian fleet began to rebuild in the 1870s, the Regina Maria Pias returned to active service in a variety of roles, both in the main fleet and in Italy's overseas empire. All four ships were modernized in the late 1880s, and were thereafter used as training ships. Regina Maria Pia, Ancona, and San Martino were stricken from the naval register in 190304, while Castelfidardo <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> as a torpedo training ship until 1910, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans {{inspected}} the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including both Asar-i Şevket-class ships, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Following {{the end of the war}} with Greece, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. Asar-i Şevket and Necm-i Şevket proved to be in too poor a condition to merit rebuilding, and they were not included in the program. The former was decommissioned in 1903 and sold for scrap in 1909. Necm-i Şevket <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> in service as a barracks ship until the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912. Bulgarian forces threatened to capture Constantinople, and so the Navy pressed the ship back into service to provide gunfire support to the Ottoman defenders. After the threat passed, she returned to barracks ship duties, a role she filled until 1929, when she was decommissioned after nearly sixty years in service.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E

5|$|Both ships served {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they {{operated}} against Russian {{forces in the}} Black Sea. They were primarily tasked with supporting Ottoman forces ashore in the Caucasus. After the war, both vessels were placed in reserve, and saw no further activity until 1897, when they were mobilized {{at the start of}} the Greco-Turkish War. Like the rest of the Ottoman fleet, both ships were in poor condition and were unable to be used offensively. Asar-i Şevket was decommissioned and sold for scrap in the 1900s but Necm-i Şevket <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> in service, primarily as a barracks ship until 1929. During this period, she briefly saw action again during the First Balkan War, when she provided fire support to beleaguered Ottoman defenders protecting Constantinople from the Bulgarian Army. She was finally decommissioned in 1929 and sold to ship breakers.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, {{is very different from}} the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E

5|$|The three Kaiser Maxes were {{stricken}} {{from the}} naval register {{after the turn}} of the century to free up funds for new construction projects. Kaiser Max and Don Juan d'Austria were deleted from the list in December and June 1904, respectively, though Prinz Eugen <b>lingered</b> <b>on</b> until December 1912. The first two ships became floating barracks and Prinz Eugen was converted into a repair ship and renamed Vulkan. All three members of the class remained in the navy's inventory through World War I; Italy seized Kaiser Max and Vulkan, though both were awarded to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the postwar peace negotiations. Italy refused to relinquish Vulkan, the fate of which is unknown, but Kaiser Max was transferred to Yugoslavia and renamed Tivat. The ship was either scrapped in 1924, or kept in the Yugoslav inventory until the country was overrun in the Axis invasion during World War II, her fate after falling back into Italian hands unknown. Don Juan d'Austria, meanwhile, sank under uncertain circumstances in 1919 before she could be seized by the victorious Allied powers.|$|E
