40|$|Many-legged animals, such as {{crabs and}} cockroaches, utilize whole-body {{mechanics}} {{similar to that}} observed for running bipeds and trotting quadrupedal mammals. Despite the diversity <b>in</b> morphology, two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> a quadrupedal mammal, three <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> an insect and four <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> a crab can function {{in the same way}} as one leg of a biped during ground contact. To explain how diverse leg designs can result in common whole-body dynamics, we used a miniature force platform to measure the ground reaction forces produced by individual legs of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis. Hexapedal runners were not like quadrupeds with an additional set of <b>legs.</b> <b>In</b> trotting quadrupedal mammals each leg develops a similar ground reaction force pattern that sums to produce the whole-body pattern. At a constant average velocity, each leg pair of the cockroach was characterized by a unique ground reaction force pattern. The first leg decelerated the center of mass in the horizontal direction, whereas the third leg was used to accelerate the body. The second leg did both, much like <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> bipedal runners and quadrupedal trotters. Vertical force peaks for each leg were equal i...|$|R

If Tonelli had replicated his relay <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg.

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> {{front of the other}} in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
