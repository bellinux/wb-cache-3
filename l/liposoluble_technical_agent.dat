The general goal is that the <b>technical</b> <b>agent</b> has a detailed understanding of the task situation such that it can execute instructions issued by a human user in a dynamically changing situation. A levelled approach for comprehensive shape representation is presented which is motivated by a cognitive model of pictorial shape representations (prototypes).

Analyzing a dataset of information technology hardware and staff spending by larger multidivisional firms during a growth phase of US IT spending, 1989 - 1993, results suggest that technical managers significantly overspent on hardware, with deleterious consequences for performance. Chief executive experience significantly altered the effects of overspending.

This paper presents a conceptual and methodological proposal for designers that supplements the existing CWA tools. The new tool is integrated into the Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis (SOCA) stage. It formalizes different kinds of associations between work functions and elementary work situations and between resources and work functions. It enables the identification of conflicts (impossible allocations) when examining a complex situation resulting from the conjunction of several elementary situations. When conflicts are resolved, it is possible to choose the best configuration among a set of possible associations between resources and work functions.

40|$|Production {{technology}} and science are inseparable. On the one hand, scientific findings are converted into economically profitable processes and production systems, {{and on the}} other hand, science benefits from production technology results as a starting point preparation of explanatory models. The Internet of Production fuels this reciprocity-based relationship and ultimately unleashes traditional experimental field labs to integrate into the "World-as-Lab". Structural changes and the dissolution of the linear cause-and effect relationships in a prospective networked production environment suggest a paradigmatic rearrangement. In addition to multidisciplinarity, this requires an extension of a causal-pareto-optimal solutions under production-induced restrictions. Open research questions lurk in the fields of the collection, structuring an duse of refined data, the analysis of networked systems with parameter identification, black- and white-box modeling and zero latency si mulation, the design of complex value-added networks and the description of socio-technical systems with their human and <b>technical</b> <b>agents</b> and the automated decision-making support...|$|R
40|$|The {{threat of}} weapons of mass {{destruction}} terrorism resulted in the U. S. Department of Homeland Security deploying large quantities of radiation detectors throughout the emergency responder community. However, emergency responders specific needs were not always met by standard health physics instrumentation used in radiation facilities. Several American National Standards Institute standards were developed and approved to evaluate the technical capabilities of detection equipment. Establishing technical capability is a critical step, but it is equally important to emergency responders that the instruments are easy to operate and can withstand the rugged situations they encounter. The System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program (managed by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Grants and Training, Systems Support Division) focuses predominantly on the usability, ergonomics, readability, and other features of the detectors, rather than performance controlled by industry standards and the manufacturers.

40|$|Society is {{challenging}} systems engineers by demanding ever {{more complex and}} integrated systems. With the rise of cloud computing and systems-of-systems (including cyber-physical systems) we are entering an era where mission critical services and applications will be dependent upon 'coalitions-of-systems'. Coalitions-of-systems (CoS) are a class of system similar to systems-of-systems but they differ in that they interact to further overlapping self-interests rather than an overarching mission. Assessing the sociotechnical risks associated with CoS is an open research question of societal importance as existing risk analysis techniques typically focus on {{the technical aspects of}} systems and ignore risks associated with coalition partners reneging on responsibilities or leaving the coalition. We demonstrate that a responsibility modeling based risk analysis approach enables the identification of sociotechnical risks associated with CoS. The approach identifies hazards and associated risks that may arise when relying upon a coalition of human/organizational/technical agents to provision a service or application. Through a case study of a proposed cloud IT infrastructure migration we show how the technique identifies vulnerabilities that may arise because of human, organizational or <b>technical</b> <b>agents</b> failing to discharge responsibilities.

40|$|Recent {{accidents}} {{of commercial}} airplanes {{have raised the}} question once more whether pilots can rely on automation in order to fly advanced aircraft safely. Although the issue of human-machine interaction in aviation has been investigated frequently, profound knowledge about pilots’ perceptions and attitudes is fragmentary and partly out-dated. The paper at hand {{presents the results of}} a pilot survey, which has been guided by a collaborative perspective of human-automation decision-making. It puts emphasis on the hybrid interaction of human actors and non-human <b>technical</b> <b>agents</b> and the role distribution in the digital cockpit. The key question is whether pilots have confidence in human-automation collaboration, even in the case of automated systems, which act more and more autonomously. The results are partly surprising: confidence in hybrid collaboration is rather high, depending mostly on perceived symmetry of humans and automation as well as on perceived change of competencies and role distribution. The perception of complexity is only average, and – most unexpected – this factor does not negatively affect pilots’ confidence in hybrid collaboration. The differences between Airbus and Boeing pilots are much lower than assumed, but pilots of regional jets, mostly flying short- or medium-range aircraft, differ from both groups remarkably, presumably due to their specific task profile, including a high number of opportunities to collaborate with automation...|$|R
