40|$|Abstract — Demand side {{management}} in the future smart grid requires new players in the electricity markets. We assume a player, the so-called aggregator which aims to utilize the flexibility in <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumers</b> with thermal energy storage. An aggregator design is proposed to mange the power consump-tion of flexible demands during {{a certain period of}} time. The setup consists of an MPC-like controller to optimally operate the consumption units for upward and downward regulating power provision. To handle the uncertainties arise from model mismatch, a series of feedback loop are also considered along with the central optimization. We formulate the problem for two specific case studies which are supermarket refrigeration systems and chiller systems in conjunction with ice tanks. Simulation results are provided for these specific consumers. I...|$|E

The editors {{and most of the}} writers of this book were members of the organizing and program committees of the 18 th Annual Conference of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP), Book Culture from Below, that took place in Helsinki in 2010. This book provides, {{for the first time in}} English, an overview of an important epoch in Finnish book and reading history. Besides depicting book culture at the periphery of Europe, it contributes to our understanding of the power of the urbanized European literary world of the 1700 s. The new reading culture that emerged in Finland during the 1700 s affected readers and all levels of society in many ways. Along with other trends, the arrival of translated fiction and Enlightenment literature from Europe opened and irrevocably altered the Finns’ world view. The change was especially pronounced in cities. Scholars, merchants, craftspersons, as well as military officers stationed at Helsinki’s offshore Sveaborg fortress, acquired world literature and guides intended for professionals at, for example, book auctions. In this book, researchers from different fields examine the significance and influence of that era’s books from cultural, historical, ideological, and social perspectives. What kinds of books did the citizens of Helsinki really buy, loan, and read during the 1700 s? What topics and ideas introduced by the new literature were discussed in salons and reading circles? Who were the books’ <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumers?</b> Who were the literary opinion leaders of their times? Why did people read? Did the books change their readers’ lives?...|$|E

Pellets are a quite new product whose production has risen exponential in recent years. Today there are small-, medium-and large-scale users, where the <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumers</b> are the heating sector. The heating sector is mainly using oil to cover the increased demand during cold periods. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the potential of pellets if it would replace thermal power plants oil and coal. The study will also analyze the economic impact a conversion would mean for a heating plant and if the pellet is a reasonable substitute. 2008 statistics from the Swedish district heating association were analyzed and a calculation was performed to determine how many tons of pellets is needed to replace coal and oil. Fuel costs for oil and coal were compared with the costs to produce the equivalent amount of heat with pellets. In order to analyze the economic impact an investment calculation was made. The payback period was calculated for a new wood powder boiler if it was to replace an existing oil boiler. The study includes a qualitative research interview, which was addressed to the largest users of fuel oil and coal for district heating. Policy influences and the heat plant's environmental policy will lead to a gradually phasing out of fossil fuels. The greatest compliment to the non-renewable energy is biofuel where pellets are a possible substitute. A pellets-consuming wood powder boiler can replace the fossil fuel consumption. The readjustment will lead to a great investment and requires that the energy sector prioritize pellets ahead of other alternative fuels...|$|E

If lecturers and researchers claim to have gained better information accessibility, thanks to the Web, they still must account for the time needed to examine the results obtained. Moreover, many of these net-users still camp with difficulties in information retrieval, where all too often their results are unsuccessful or unsatisfactory. University lecturers and researchers at an Engineering College in Nantes on the West coast of France base this paper on a survey that examines the use of and performance with digital documents. The study was conducted during the year 2003 with about 70 persons from various fields and disciplines including physics, computer science, sociology, etc. This study looks at the lecturer-researcher in the capacity of information seeker and reveals a rather sedentary and autonomous figure, one who first relies on the resources offered by his/her own computer. Even though they are partly unsatisfied, they claim no time to waste on improving their information search skills. New tools bringing relevant, rich, and reliable scientific information and documentation are of interest to them. Certainly, if this would help them capture that which would otherwise have been neglected when only classical search techniques are applied. However, these tools must be simple to use, fast, and available where and when needed. This study is part of a user-centered design approach in the construction of an open archive platform, planned to create institutional repositories that will be managed by librarians in their respective institutions. Using this tool, the authors would be able to store, convert (XML), fully index, perpetuate, valorize, and distribute their digital documents.

This study uses a mixed methods design with a qualitative study to identify four determinants of on-the-go consumption: time pressure, price consciousness, health orientation, and enjoyment. Combining the qualitative results with Behavioral Decision Theory, eight hypotheses are derived about the influence of the four determinants as well as their interrelations. Hypotheses testing and predictive validity assessment are based on two <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> samples, one main study and one validation study. The results confirm a significant influence of utilitarian de- terminants (time pressure and price consciousness), though they are less important than the hedonic determinant. Implications for retail managers are presented, as these results challenge conventional practices. Moreover, existing theory is extended beyond a distinction between utilitarian and hedonic motives by regarding health orientation as a hybrid determinant of on-the-go consumption...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Web {{surveys are}} {{frequently}} based on samples drawn from panels with {{large amounts of}} nonresponse or haphazard selection.

Simulation {{results show that the}} matched sample estimators are superior to weighting a random sub-sample from the panel and have a similar sampling distribution to simple random sampling from the population.

Consumer preference is thus an essential input for the requirements elicitation process of public-facing enterprise systems. Previous studies in this area have proposed a process to capture and translate consumer preferences into system-related goals using the Consumer Preference Meta-Model (CPMM) used to integrate consumer values from the marketing domain into objectives of information systems. However, there exists a knowledge gap between how this process can be automated at a large scale, when massive data sources, such as social media data, are used as inputs for the process.

The scheme called Meat Standards Australia (MSA) has identified the Critical Control Points (CCPs) from the production, pre-slaughter, processing and value adding sectors of the beef supply chain and quantified their relative importance using <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> testing. These CCPs {{have been used to}} manage beef palatability in two ways. Firstly, CCPs from the pie-slaughter and processing sectors have been used as mandatory criteria for carcasses to be graded. Secondly, other CCPs from the production and processing sectors have been incorporated into a model to predict palatability for individual muscles.

40|$|In recent years, <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> {{networks}} on the Internet {{have provided}} a new communication channel for consumers to share product evaluations online. These networks have dramatically increased the impact of word of mouth, and correspondingly changed the way consumers shop. One form of word of mouth recently emerging on the Internet is product reviews written by consumers. In chapter one, we examine the role of consumer heterogeneity in affecting the accuracy of these product reviews as a mechanism to communicate quality information among consumers. When consumers hold different opinions about quality of the same product, consumers 2 ̆ 7 self-selection behavior in purchase may cause bias in reviews at various stages of the product lifecycle. Using book reviews posted on Amazon, we find a significant declining curve in book ratings over time, which suggests that consumers who self-select into the market early (tend to buy early) may have systematically different preferences compared to the consumers who buy later. In addition, our additional empirical evidence suggests that consumers follow early reviews regardless of the bias. We then construct an analytical model based on the empirical observations to examine how consumer welfare and firm strategies {{are affected by the}} presence of consumers 2 ̆ 7 self-selection behavior. In chapter two, we investigate how market competition can be influenced when consumers can acquire quality information for untested products from consumer reviews. Our results show that, contingent on the accuracy of consumer reviews as a mechanism to signal quality, the reduction of uncertainty driven by these reviews does not necessarily force the market to become more competitive. ...|$|R

While the ultimate objective is the safest and most secure protocol, convenience and usability should not be ignored, or the protocol may not be suitable for large-scale deployment. Our aim in {{this paper is to}} design a practical electronic payment protocol which is both secure and convenient. ANSI X 9. 59 standard describes secure payment objects to be used in electronic payment in a convenient and secure way. It has many useful convenience features for <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> market deployment, the best being the elimination of consumer certificates. Consumer public keys are stored in account records at financial institutions; the digital signatures issued by consumers are verified by financial institutions. Encryption is deliberately not provided by X 9. 59. In this paper we propose a new Internet e-payment protocol, namely CONSEPP (CONvenient and Secure E-Payment Protocol), based on the account authority model of ANSI X 9. 59 standard. CONSEPP is the specialized version of X 9. 59 for Internet transactions (X 9. 59 is multi-purpose). It has some extra features on top of the X 9. 59 standard. X 9. 59 requires merchant certificates; in CONSEPP we propose a lightweight method to avoid the need for merchant certificates. Moreover, we propose a simple method for secure shopping experience between merchant and consumer. Merchant authentication is embedded in the payment cycle. CONSEPP aims to use current financial transaction networks, like VisaNet, BankNet and ACH networks, for communications among financial institutions. No certificates (in the classical sense) or certificate authorities exist in CONSEPP. Convenience is not traded for security here; basic security requirements are fulfi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Australia has {{developed}} the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grading scheme to predict beef quality for consumers. This system is comprehensive, accurate and scientifically supported. It {{is based on}} the development and the use of a research database with a large amount of data, including the use of a <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> testing system with cuts cooked in different ways as well as information on the corresponding animals, carcasses and cuts. The system is also based on statistical analyses carried out on this database to identify the critical control points of beef palatability which is indicated for individual muscles and for a specific cooking method and aging time. Experts involved in the French beef industry were questioned about their knowledge and views on the application of the MSA system. They recognised many qualities of the MSA system and it was judged as original, relevant and sufficiently mature in its application, and favouring scientifically based prediction of beef quality rather than replying on tradition and perceptions of quality. It was also thought to be credible, flexible and open ended. However, it was still considered to possess some weak points. Thus, while its development in Australia at the farmer and abattoir level has been impressive in a relatively short time, the final delivery of precise quality grades to consumers is still lacking at retail due to only partial implementation of the system. Its adaptability to France would be difficult due to the complexity of the French beef industry and market. But, the program is uniquely innovative and deserves consideration.

An AVG {{is defined as a}} set of audio and visual codewords that are grouped together according to their strong temporal correlations in videos. The AVGs carry unique audio-visual cues to represent the video content, based on which an audiovisual dictionary can be constructed for concept classification. By using the entire AVGs as building elements, the audio-visual dictionary is much more robust than traditional vocabularies that use discrete audio or visual codewords. Specifically, we conduct coarse-level foreground/background separation in both audio and visual channels, and discover four types of AVGs by exploring mixed-and-matched temporal audio-visual correlations among the following factors: visual foreground, visual background, audio foreground, and audio background. All of these types of AVGs provide discriminative audio-visual patterns for classifying various semantic concepts.

40|$|Collective Harm Cases pervade {{the modern}} world. In these cases, people collectively cause harm, {{or fail to}} prevent it, but no {{individual}} seems to make a difference. For example, while climate change is caused by millions of people acting in certain ways (driving in cars, flying in planes, using coal-generated electricity, etc.), it seems that no individual such act will make a difference. Similarly, while the <b>large-scale</b> <b>consumer</b> patterns of wealthy nations can affect {{the lives of people}} in poorer nations, {{it is hard to believe}} that any individual purchase will make a difference for the worse. In cases of this sort, if it is true that no individual act will make a difference, it is unclear how we can say that anyone ought, or even has reason, to act otherwise. But if we cannot, this would be very troubling. Morality would be powerless in a wide array of cases in which it should have force. This is the Problem of Collective Harm. I argue that the key to solving the Problem of Collective Harm is to reject a standard, intuitive assumption that underlies it. The assumption is that if an act cannot make a difference with respect to an outcome, then it cannot play a morally significant, non-superfluous causal role in bringing that outcome about. Or, to put it another way, we must reject the assumption that helping to bring about an outcome requires making a difference to it. This assumption is highly natural, but I argue that it is mistaken and that once we see that it is mistaken, the central puzzle of the Problem of Collective Harm is resolved. Chapter 1 is devoted to setting out the problem and how I will approach it. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss a range of proposed solutions that have been put forth by others. The upshot of the critique of these views will be that we cannot solve the Problem of Collective Harm unless we can reject the assumption that helping requires making a difference. In Chapter 4, I turn to my positive proposal. There I give an account of what is required for an act to help to bring about an outcome, where this does not require being able to make a difference. I use this account to explain our reasons for action in Collective Harm Cases, and I give an error theory that explains why the standard assumption seems right, even though it is not. In Chapter 5, I highlight some noteworthy features of my proposal and some important questions about it that still need to be addressed...|$|R

In this article, the evaluation of five dif-ferent interventions from a <b>large-scale</b> program on <b>consumer</b> climate edu-cation provides the empirical background for illustrating the problems confronting quasi-experimental impact analyses in a free-choice context and presenting a possible solution based on propensity score matching (PSM) ...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published at:[URL] emulsification (ME) is a relatively new technique for the highly controlled production of particulates. This review focuses on the recent developments in this area, ranging from the production of simple oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions to multiple emulsions of different types, solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) dispersions, coherent solids (silica particles, solid lipid microspheres, solder metal powder) and structured solids (solid lipid microcarriers, gel microbeads, polymeric microspheres, core-shell microcapsules and hollow polymeric microparticles). Other emerging technologies that extend the capabilities into different membrane materials and operation methods (such as rotating membranes, repeated membrane extrusion of coarsely pre-emulsified feeds) are introduced. The results of experimental work carried out by cited researchers in the field together with those of the current authors are presented in a tabular form in a rigorous and systematic manner. These demonstrate a wide range of products that can be manufactured using different membrane approaches. Opportunities for creation of new and novel entities are highlighted for low throughput applications (medical diagnostics, healthcare) and for <b>large-scale</b> productions (<b>consumer</b> and personal products) ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we study}} the main {{determinants}} of price for Italian red wine {{sold on the}} domestic market via the estimation of a hedonic price function for the period 2005 - 2009. For each bottle considered, our dataset contains several characteristics, such as the price by retail channel (price in supermarkets and in wine shops), label characteristics, chemical analysis and sensory and experts' evaluations. The unique features of the dataset allow us to study the price formation in the different market segments. The analysis shows that in the <b>large-scale</b> retail trade <b>consumers</b> value most what is written on the label, but {{only if it is}} a verifiable characteristic; label characteristics are also important in wine shops, but a selection process exists to enter this market. Finally, selling wine via both channels appears to be a winning strategy: it allows the price to be increased in the large-scale retail trade, but it does not reduce the price in wine shops...|$|R
