40|$|The {{blurring}} of lines between editorial/news content and advertising/promotional messaging (both {{in print and}} online/social media platforms) potentially threatens the ability of consumers to develop informed opinions and to make rational decisions. It is critical that {{a clear distinction between}} editorial content and sponsored content be apparent to the consumer. While the use of advertorials began in the 1940 s, the practice has expanded to new platforms and is now commonly called native advertising – a paid placement that mimics the user experience of organic sharing of information via online, print, or broadcast media. The sponsor of the content should be clearly identified. However, in some instances, sponsorship is hidden or left off altogether. BACKGROUND: In 1917 when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) first addressed a case against advertising disguised as content, both regulatory bodies and consumer advocates expressed concern about paid messages that may deceive consumers. The legal and ethical debate on the topic continues now, decades later. However, the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> competitive media markets has driven the discussion of native advertising to the forefront.

50|$|Pace: Pace handicappers {{classify}} each horse’s running style (i.e. front runner, stalker, presser, closer) {{and then}} find contenders based on the predicted <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> race. The difficulty is that the jockey has control over where a horse is placed in a race and how fast that race goes in the early stages. This takes the prediction <b>of</b> <b>pace</b> for a given race {{out of the realm}} of mathematics and into the realm of mere speculation. Until the 1970s, for pace handicapping purposes, the time generally allotted by pace handicappers for a horse to run a length (approximately 11 feet) {{during the course of a}} race was long thought to be a fifth of a second. Andrew Beyer was the first to contest this in his 1975 book Picking Winners, stating that the time span of a beaten length (at the end of the race) varied by race distance, as horses would be traveling faster at the end of shorter distanced races than they would at longer ones. Others, particularly devotees of the Sartain Methodology in the 1980s, furthered this principle to include fractional (internal race) times. <b>Today,</b> the value <b>of</b> a beaten length is generally accepted to be closer to 0.16 seconds than to 0.20. The standard of one-fifth of a second is somewhat valid in Standardbred (harness) racing.|$|R

40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the award of PhD of Loughborough University. In modern enterprises, workflow technology is commonly used for business process automation. Established business processes represent successful business practice and become {{a crucial part of}} corporate assets. In the Internet era, electronic business is chosen by more and more organisations as a preferred way of conducting business practice. In response to the increasing demands for cross-organisational business automation, especially those raised by the B 2 B electronic commerce community, the concept of collaboration between automated business processes, i. e. workflow collaboration, is emerging. Otherwise, automation would be confined within individual organisations and cross-organisational collaboration would still have to be carried out manually. However, much of the previous research work overlooks the acquisition of the compatible workflows at build time and simply assumes that compatibility is achieved through face-toface negotiation followed by a design from scratch approach that creates collaborative workflows based on the agreement resulted from the negotiation. The resource-intensive and error-prone approach can hardly keep up with the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>today’s</b> marketplace with increasing transaction volume and complexity. This thesis identifies the requirements for cross-organisational workflow collaboration (COWCO) through an integrated approach, proposes a comprehensive supporting framework, explains the key enabling techniques of the framework, and implements and evaluates them {{in the form of a}} prototype system – COWCO-Guru. With the support of such a framework, cross-organisational workflow collaboration can be managed and conducted with reduced human effort, which will further facilitate cross-organisational e-business, especially B 2 B e-commerce practices...|$|R
40|$|The current <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>today's</b> {{information}} technologies might lead the casual observer {{to believe that}} this is all new. However the reality is that, as with most things, this is really a long evolution of processes based on tried, tested and re-adapted techniques. This thesis represents 12 years of predominantly technology driven research and covers a whole range of characterising, evaluating and fabricating devices based on liquid crystalline systems. Firstly polymer liquid crystals are discussed with respect to the fabrication of a flexible substrate display based on standard printing techniques and this is shown to have improved display viewing properties over a standard polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) device. Following on from this work is presented that involves the production of regular grid arrays in isotropic polymers that are used as control structures in nematic liquid crystal systems. This progresses onto a now patented device that allows the production of robust ferroelectric devices based on PDLC technology. Whilst the development of production techniques is important for the advancement of devices it would not be possible to keep up the pace without continued research into the basic liquid crystalline systems. The final chapter reviews work currently under supervision of the author based on flexoelectric effects in symmetric bimesogens. These materials possess responses times of the order of #approx# 100 #mu#s with an effective optic axis switching angle that is linear with the applied field and can be in well in excess of 90 deg.

In the three-day ritual, the process of marriage starts with Naandi (literally meaning start). During Naandi, which {{takes place in the}} groom's and bride's homes separately, but at the same time, a ceremony is performed where the bride and groom have coconut oil and turmeric applied to them and are bathed in hot water followed by other rituals. Marriage (Madimae in Tulu) takes place at a temple, hall or auditorium followed by lunch. All the ceremonies are held as per horoscopes of bride and groom at a particular time called muhurtha. Generally the day after marriage, a ceremony called as the Bigara authana (a sort of reception) is held at the groom's place and consists of the Satyanarayana puja and other rituals followed by lunch. The bigara authana is an equivalent of the marriage reception. Fourth day is small function at the bride's house named as [...] "Aarthakshathe." [...] It is a ritual where shamiana (house decorative) will be removed concluding end of the ceremony. Bride and groom's Basinga (a wearing specially worn on wedding day) is tied to a pole in the bride's house and the newly married couple will start their new life with elders' (hiriyer) blessings.On the fourth day there is a symbolic representation of fish catching in brides house to represent the actual origins of shivalli women from mogers (i.e fisherwoman)and other castes.|$|R

They are aided by portable pensions and the increase in expendable wealth experienced by some northern Europeans in recent decades. And the migration or mobility is eased by the existence and development of reasonably-priced and regular transport routes, cheap airlines, and a good local infrastructure that was developed initially for tourism. Key areas of North European settlement in Spain are the Costa Blanca, the Costa del Sol, Mallorca and the Canary Islands. These “immigrants” now form a large minority group. Officially, the largest groups of migrants in Spain are Moroccans (500, 000), followed by Colombians, Ecuadorians, Romanians, then migrants from the United Kingdom (220, 000), followed by Germans (120, 000).

One of the most unusual way of escaping from the most traumatic experiences in one’s life is the dissociation mechanism, in the most severe cases resulting in dissociative identity disorder. The aim of this study is to present current state of art on the issue of DID and future courses of diagnostics and possible treatment. Within the study, out of 210 articles related to the dissociative identity disorder, multiple personality disorder, 12 significant articles were used in the analysis. Dissociative identity disorder is becoming more and more frequent diagnosis in modern psychiatry. For the diagnostic purposes, broad differential diagnostics process has to be applied as DID is related to many other psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia or PTSD. Apart from that, DID patients and their personalities suffer from many psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, OCD disorders. Unfortunately, due to the length of the treatment processes, which last for the whole life of the patient, it’s hard to identify the cases with full integration of identity and full recovery. As a conclusion, authors define DID as an important issue in modern psychiatry which should be further addressed in neurobiological and pharmacological studies.
