5|$|In 1995, Germany won {{its third}} European Championship. After winning all {{qualification}} matches, scoring 55 goals, the German team defeated England 6–2 over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-final. Germany met Sweden in the final, which was {{played at the}} Fritz Walter Stadion in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on 26 March 1995. The Swedish team managed to score early, but Germany came back to win 3–2 with goals from Maren Meinert, Birgit Prinz and Bettina Wiegmann.|$|E
5|$|Independiente {{qualified}} for the Intercontinental Cup as the reigning Copa Libertadores winners. They had won the 1984 Copa Libertadores beating Grêmio 3–1 on points over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals. It would be Independiente's sixth appearance in the competition. Their previous five appearances had resulted in one win in 1973 and four defeats in 1964, 1965, 1972 and 1974.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four <b>legs)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E

5|$|Their first match, in the UEFA Cup, {{was against}} Finnish side Kuusyi Lahti, which they won 6–1. A 6–2 {{aggregate}} victory {{set up a}} tie against Auxerre of France {{in the second round}} who they beat 3–2 on aggregate. The club defeated Swarovski Tirol of Austria in the third round 6–0 on aggregate before losing to Genoa (Italy) 4–1 over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarter finals.|$|E
5|$|City {{ended the}} 1963–64 season in 11th place, having been {{inconsistent}} all season. Success instead {{came through the}} League Cup, as they beat West Ham United 6–3 over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals to reach the final against Stoke City. The opening tie at the Victoria Ground finished 1–1 in extremely muddy conditions as Banks spilled a shot from Bill Asprey, with Keith Bebbington pouncing on the rebound. Back at Filbert Street, goals from Mike Stringfellow, Dave Gibson and Howard Riley won the game for Leicester 3–2 and settled the tie at 4–3.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{advanced}} {{from the}} first round of 1971 CONCACAF Championship qualification with an aggregate score of 4–2 against Nicaragua after home and away <b>legs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second round, El Salvador withdrew from the playoff when they had to play against Honduras, meaning Honduras qualified by default. The national team also took part in the 1973 CONCACAF Championship qualification, which doubled as qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, but they did not advance to the final stage after they were eliminated by Guatemala with an aggregate score of 0–2 (0–1, 0–1). The team was managed by Hector D'Angelo.|$|E

5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (<b>legs)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour {{continued}} with two further <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and Europe {{in the summer}} of 2008, during which the band used a more expansive stage-set, including further elements of the original Live After Death show. With the sole UK concert taking place at Twickenham Stadium, this would be the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country. The three 2008 legs of the tour were remarkably successful; it was the second highest grossing tour of the year for a British artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} were drawn {{against each other}} again in two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League knockout stage. The first match was held in Stuttgart on 25 February 2004 at Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, which Chelsea also won 1–0 after an own goal scored by Fernando Meira, while a scoreless draw played on 9 March 2004 in Stamford Bridge was enough for Chelsea {{to advance to the}} quarter-finals with a 1–0 aggregate win.|$|E

40|$|After spinal surgery, physiotherapeutic {{exercises}} are performed {{to achieve a}} rapid return to normal life. One important aim of treatment is to regain muscle strength, but {{it is known that}} muscle forces increase the spinal loads to potentially hazardous levels. It has not yet been clarified which exercises cause high spinal forces and thus endanger the surgical outcome. The loads on vertebral body replacements were measured in 5 patients during eleven physiotherapeutic exercises, performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supine, prone, or lateral position or on all fours (kneeling on the hands and knees). Low resultant forces on the vertebral body replacement were measured for the following exercises: lifting one straight <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supine position, abduction of <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lateral position, outstretching one <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all-fours position, and hollowing <b>the</b> back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all-fours position. From the biomechanical point of view, these exercises can be performed shortly after surgery. Implant forces similar or even greater than those for walking were measured during: lifting both <b>legs,</b> lifting <b>the</b> pelvis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supine position, outstretching one arm with or without simultaneously outstretching <b>the</b> contralateral <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all-fours position, and arching <b>the</b> back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all-fours position. These exercises should not be performed shortly after spine surgery...|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the Football League was suspended indefinitely, leaving the club with no revenue. The Football League organised regional competitions after the government gave the Football Association permission for football to proceed on a wartime footing. York decided to carry on playing and were placed in the North East League, where they ranked eighth in their section of 11 clubs. In the final weeks of 1939–40, York competed in the Football League War Cup. The club was placed in the Football League North for 1940–41, and finished 32nd in the 36-club league. They beat Sheffield Wednesday 7–0 in the War Cup, before being eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round. After completing 18 fixtures in the 1941–42 Football League North, York competed in the league-organised qualifying stage of the War Cup. They were eliminated after ranking 33rd of 54 clubs, failing to qualify for the knock-out stages by one place. York played in the Combined Counties Cup in the season's closing weeks, and beat Halifax Town 5–4 over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final.|$|E
5|$|Celtic's league title win in 1998 {{gave the}} club their first {{opportunity}} {{to compete in the}} rebranded UEFA Champions League in 1998–99. Two qualifying rounds had first to be negotiated, however. St Patrick's Athletic were knocked out, but Celtic were then paired up against a strong Croatia Zagreb side comprising several players who had helped Croatia to third place at the 1998 World Cup. The first leg took place in Glasgow amidst a row between Celtic players and the club bosses over bonuses. A Darren Jackson goal gave Celtic a 10 win to take over to Zagreb, but an insipid second leg performance in match dominated by Robert Prosinečki saw Celtic beaten 30 to go out on aggregate. Only a fine showing from Jonathan Gould in goal saved Celtic from a more emphatic defeat. The club dropped into the UEFA Cup. Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães were defeated 21 in both <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, but Celtic crashed out in the second round against Zürich 53 on aggregate as a public row between captain Paul Lambert and managing director Jock Brown raged behind the scenes.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 2011, Stoke beat Hadjuk Split 2–0 {{over two}} <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third {{qualifying}} {{round of the}} Europa League. It was Stoke's first appearance in Europe in 37 years. Stoke would go on progress past FC Thun in the Play-off round gaining entrance into the group stage where Stoke were handed a tough draw against Besiktas, Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Stoke {{finished second in the}} group and were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants Valencia in the round of 32, following the draw manager Pulis stated that he is relishing the prospect of taking on one of Europe's top clubs. Stoke lost both legs 1–0 to end their European campaign. Pulis received criticism from some supporters after he fielded a weakened team in the second leg. Stoke ended the 2011–12 season in 14th position in what was perceived to be a disappointing season. The 2012–13 season saw Stoke make little progress, finishing in 13th position. Pulis subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.|$|E
50|$|A {{standing}} version {{can also}} be applied which sees a standing wrestler place one of his legs between the legs of a face-down opponent and then bends one leg behind the leg of the wrestler, placing {{it on top of}} the knee pit of the opponents other leg. The wrestler then picks up the straight leg of the opponent, bends it backwards to lock <b>the</b> other <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knee pit and places <b>the</b> foot <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> shin of <b>the</b> standing <b>leg</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knee pit, thus locking the leg.|$|R

5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Đurić {{began the}} 2012 tournament as second-choice forward but {{following}} {{an injury to}} midfielder Hariss Harun, he was recalled into the first eleven on the left flank. He scored the third goal in a 3–0 win over defending champions Malaysia in the first match. With his goal against Malaysia, he became the oldest goalscorer {{in the history of}} the competition. Singapore lost 1–0 to Indonesia three days later but defeated Laos 4–3 in the final group stage match to advance to the next round on goal difference. They defeated Philippines 1–0 on aggregate over two <b>legs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals to advance to the finals. Singapore went on to defeat Thailand in the finals to become champions. Đurić retired from international football with a record of 24 goals in 53 international appearances after the tournament.|$|E
