Except for the 1 <b>lilangeni,</b> the coins were not round, with the 1 and 50 cents dodecagonal, the 2 cents square with rounded corners and the 5, 10 and 20 cents scalloped.|$|E
50|$|The nickel-brass L1 coins have {{exactly the}} same {{dimensions}} and composition as the British £1 coins introduced three years earlier. As 1 <b>lilangeni</b> is worth about £0.05 (2015), the Swazi coins are sometimes used fraudulently in British vending machines.|$|E

50|$|Although the South African rand {{is legal}} tender in all states, the {{other member states}} issue their own currencies: the Lesotho loti, Namibian dollar and Swazi <b>lilangeni.</b> However, these are {{exchanged}} at par with the rand {{and there is no}} immediate prospect of change. Foreign exchange regulations and monetary policy throughout the CMA continue to reflect the influence of the South African Reserve Bank.|$|E
50|$|Swaziland, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, and the Republic of South Africa {{form the}} Southern African Customs Union (SACU), where import duties apply uniformly to member countries. Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa also {{are members of}} the Common Monetary Area (CMA) in which {{repatriation}} and unrestricted funds are permitted. Swaziland issues its own currency, the <b>lilangeni</b> (plural: emalangeni), which is at par with the South African rand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lilangeni</b> (plural: emalangeni, ISO 4217 code: SZL) is the {{currency}} of Swaziland and is subdivided into 100 cents. It is issued by the Central Bank of Swaziland (in swazi Umntsholi Wemaswati). The South African rand is also accepted in Swaziland. Similar to the Lesotho loti, there are singular and plural abbreviations, namely L and E, so where one might have an amount L1, it would be E2, E3, or E4.|$|E
50|$|Swaziland is a {{developing}} country with a small economy. With a GDP per capita of $9,714, it is classified as {{a country with a}} lower-middle income. As a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), its main local trading partner is South Africa; in order to ensure economic stability, Swaziland's currency, the <b>lilangeni,</b> is pegged to the South African rand. Swaziland's major overseas trading partners are the United States and the European Union. The majority of the country's employment is provided by its agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Swaziland {{is a member of the}} Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations.|$|E
50|$|On 6 September 1974, the Monetary Authority of Swaziland {{introduced}} {{notes in}} denominations of 1 <b>lilangeni,</b> 2, 5 and 10 emalangeni, with 20 emalangeni notes following in 1978. In 1981, the Central Bank of Swaziland took over paper money production, first issuing notes commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of King Sobhuza II. Between 1982 and 1985, it introduced non-commemorative notes for E2, E5, E10, and E20. The 50 emalangeni notes {{were introduced in}} 1990. The E2 and E5 notes were replaced by coins in 1995, whilst 100 and 200 emalangeni notes were introduced in 1996 and 1998, respectively, with the E200 notes commemorating the 30th anniversary of independence. On September 5, 2008, the Central Bank of Swaziland issued 100-, and 200-emalangeni notes to commemorate the 40th birthday of King Mswati III and the 40th anniversary of independence. On November 1, 2010, the Central Bank of Swaziland has issued {{a new series of}} banknotes with enhanced security features.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the counterfeit protection and counterfeit itself related issues of payment instruments. The {{main part of the}} thesis is devoted to the security features of banknotes and payment cards. In this thesis, banknotes are divided into three categories based on the method of production for classification purposes. These three categories consist of paper, polymer and hybrid banknotes and Czech crown, the Australian dollar and the Swazi <b>lilangeni</b> were chosen as representatives. Furthermore, the thesis focuses on counterfeiting particular payment instruments and comparison of them...|$|E
