40|$|The {{effect of}} oral <b>lidamidine</b> {{hydrochloride}} and subcutaneous long acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201 - 995, on stool output {{and salt and}} water transport in the small intestine was investigated in a patient with gross secretory diarrhoea caused by a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) secreting tumour in the liver. Transport in the jejunum and ileum were assessed by steady state perfusion techniques. Under basal conditions, the patient was absorbing fluid and electrolytes from the jejunum and ileum, but at rates that were abnormally low. <b>Lidamidine</b> {{had no effect on}} either intestinal transport or stool frequency and output. SMS 201 - 995 increased intestinal absorption in the jejunum and ileum, reduced plasma VIP concentrations, daily stool frequency and weight, and enabled the patient to resume a normal diet without oral or intravenous fluid and electrolyte supplements. After two months of treatment, medical control was becoming increasingly difficult and stool output had risen again to 2 litres per day. Surgical resection, fortunately, was possible and led to resolution of symptoms and normal plasma VIP concentrations...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Current {{approaches}} to treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) aim to normalise disturbed intestinal physiology. The most effective centrally acting drugs are tricyclic antidepressants. Alosetron, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist {{is effective in}} women with diarrhea-predominant IBS whilst tegaserod and prucalopride are 5 -HT 4 agonists enhancing bowel motility in constipation-predominant IBS. Serotonergic receptor modulation has been the first targeted pharmacological intervention. The development of new drugs constitutes a major challenge as there are many targets along the brain-gut axis and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Newer tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects and corticotrophin releasing factor- 1 (CRF- 1) antagonists are examples of future centrally acting drugs. Agents that alter visceral sensitivity include kappa-opioid agonists (fedotozine, trimebutine, asimadoline), alpha- 2 adrenoreceptor agonists (clonidine, <b>lidamidine),</b> tachykinin receptor antagonists (neurokinin A, substance P) and other experimental anti-nociceptive drugs (GABA-B receptor agonists). COX- 2 inhibitors may be effective for postinfectious IBS. Drugs potentially useful in controlling intestinal motility and secretion other than serotonergic receptors modulators, include muscarinic receptors antagonists (derifenacin, zamenifenacin), octreotide and CCK- 1 receptor antagonists (dexloglumide). Neurotrophins (NT- 3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor) are promising factors {{for the treatment of}} IBS patients with constipation. The development of new and effective drugs for IBS requires a more detailed understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, a fact that will allow us a more targeted intervention.
