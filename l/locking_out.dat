5|$|Prior to the 1918–19 season, {{ownership}} of the Senators changed. While Ted Dey negotiated with Percy Quinn for a lease for The Arena, Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease, causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving the team from The Arena back to Aberdeen Pavilion. However, {{it turned out that}} Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL {{for the next five years}} and <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> any rival league from their arenas.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially {{after the turn of the}} 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.|$|E
25|$|Employer {{reactions}} to whipsaw strikes vary widely. In some countries which ban worker strikes, the whipsaw strike is illegal and employers {{are able to}} work with government law enforcement officials to end its use. In countries where the whipsaw strike is permitted, employers often counter this form of strike by <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> all employees who work for the employer association and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance {{supported}} the <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> workers by donating $500 and encouraging {{members of the}} party to match that donation. It also criticised the Labour government for remaining silent during the dispute. and The Workers Party produced and distributed a bulletin supporting the <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> workers, and encouraging the public to donate to the <b>locked</b> <b>out</b> worker fund.|$|R

25|$|In {{a related}} development, Livingstone entered into an {{agreement}} with the managers of the Jubilee Rink to lease it for pro hockey. The manager and lessee of the Jubilee Rink, Albert Allard signed the lease against the wishes of the owner of the Jubilee Rink, the Jubilee Rink Company. When the rink owners came to fire Allard and end his lease, the rink was closed by security, <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> the owners. Legal action came to a head on December 16 when Lucien Riopel won a court judgment expelling Allard.|$|E
25|$|The 1923 strike {{destroyed}} the ILA, {{and it was}} soon replaced a new organization, the Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association (VDWWA). Set up originally by the bosses as a company union, the VDWWA soon began to take a confrontational stance towards the Shipping Federation. By 1935, nearly every port in British Columbia had been organised by the VDWWA. Following the pretext {{to the destruction of}} the ILA, the Shipping Federation provoked another major strike in the spring of 1935, <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> 50 dockers at the port at Powell River.|$|E
25|$|The Building Trades Council (BTC) of San Francisco, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of P. H. McCarthy, won the eight-hour day in 1900 when the BTC unilaterally declared that its members would work only eight hours a day for $3 a day. When the mill resisted, the BTC began organising mill workers; the employers responded by <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> 8,000 employees throughout the Bay Area. The BTC, in return, established a union planing mill from which construction employers could obtain supplies– or face boycotts and sympathy strikes if they did not. The mill owners went to arbitration, where the union won the eight-hour day, a closed shop for all skilled workers, and an arbitration panel to resolve future disputes. In return, the union agreed to refuse to work with material produced by non-union planing mills or those that paid less than the Bay Area employers.|$|E

25|$|Umar's {{political}} genius first manifested as {{the architect}} of the caliphate after Muhammad died on 8 June 632. While the funeral of Muhammad was being arranged a group of Muhammad's followers who were natives of Medina, the Ansar (helpers), organised a meeting {{on the outskirts of the}} city, effectively <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> those companions known as Muhajirs (The Emigrants) including Umar. Umar found out about this meeting at Saqifah Bani Saadah, and taking with him two other Muhajirs, Abu Bakr and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, proceeded to the meeting, presumably to head off the Ansar's plans for political separatism. Arriving at the meeting Umar was faced with a unified community of tribes from the Ansar who refused to accept the leadership of the Muhajirs. However Umar was undeterred in his belief the caliphate should be under the control of the Muhajirs. Though the Khazraj were in disagreement, Umar after strained negotiations lasting up to one or two days, brilliantly divided the Ansar into their old warring factions of Aws and Khazraj tribes. Umar resolved the divisions by placing his hand on that of Abu Bakr as a unity candidate for those gathered in the Saqifah. Others gathered at the Saqifah meeting followed suit with the exception of the Khazraj tribe and their leader, Sa'd ibn 'Ubada, whose tribe was ostracized. The Khazraj tribe is said to have posed no significant threat as there were sufficient men of war from the Medinan tribes such as the Banu Aws to immediately organize them into a military bodyguard for Abu Bakr.|$|E
500|$|The {{start of}} the 2012–13 NHL season was {{postponed}} until January 2013 due to the owners <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> the players as negotiations took place to solidify a new collective bargaining agreement. [...] During this time, Crosby was a regular attendee of meetings taking place between NHLPA representatives and NHL owners. [...] The lock-out began on September 15, 2012, and officially ended January 6, 2013, with the NHL regular season getting underway on January 19. During the 119-day lock-out, Crosby was often questioned about his future plans should the lock-out persist, and said {{on more than one}} occasion that he was entertaining contract offers from various teams in European leagues (where many NHL players went so that they could continue playing in a professional capacity while waiting for the lock-out to end or for the NHL season to be officially cancelled). Crosby continued to practice and participated with other NHL players who had not gone overseas in several exhibition games open to the public.|$|E
500|$|Following the Civil War, {{particularly}} {{following the}} Depression of 1873–79, {{there was a}} rapid expansion of industrial production in the United States. Chicago was a major industrial center {{and tens of thousands}} of German and Bohemian immigrants were employed at about $1.50 a day. [...] American workers worked on average slightly over 60 hours, during a six-day work week. [...] The city became a center for many attempts to organize labor's demands for better working conditions. [...] Employers responded with anti-union measures, such as firing and blacklisting union members, <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> workers, recruiting strikebreakers; employing spies, thugs, and private security forces and exacerbating ethnic tensions in order to divide the workers. [...] Mainstream newspapers supported business interests, and were opposed by the labor and immigrant press. [...] During the economic slowdown between 1882 and 1886, socialist and anarchist organizations were active. Membership of the Knights of Labor, which rejected socialism and radicalism, but supported the 8-hour work day, grew from 70,000 in 1884 to over 700,000 by 1886. In Chicago, the anarchist movement of several thousand, mostly immigrant, workers centered about the German-language newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung ("Workers' Times"), edited by August Spies. Other anarchists operated a militant revolutionary force with an armed section that was equipped with guns and explosives. Its revolutionary strategy centered around the belief that successful operations against the police and the seizure of major industrial centers would result in massive public support by workers, start a revolution, destroy capitalism, and establish a socialist economy.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the use of}} strikebreakers increased, the Supreme Court {{was forced}} to address several issues arising from the practice. One key issue was motive: Did it matter if the use of strikebreakers was {{motivated}} by anti-union animus? In Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17 (1954), the Supreme Court held that proof of motive was indeed required. However, no proof of motive was needed where employer conduct [...] "inherently" [...] encouraged or discouraged union membership. A second issue involved use of the whipsaw strike. As unionization in an industry spread, unions encouraged employers to bargain as a group. To discourage employers from breaking away from the group, unions developed the whipsaw strike—-in which the union would strike one employer at a time, one after another. Employer groups would counter the whipsaw strike by <b>locking</b> <b>out</b> all workers at all employers belonging to the group, and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements. The question before the Court was whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP.|$|E
