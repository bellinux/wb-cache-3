5|$|Dark Forces {{uses the}} Jedi game engine, which was {{developed}} {{specifically for the}} game. The engine adds gameplay features to the first-person shooter genre which were uncommon {{at the time of}} release, including level designs with multiple floors and the ability to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworlds game {{engine was}} written by a small team. Chris Green {{provided}} the game's texture mapping algorithm, which was applied to walls, floors and ceilings. The engine allowed for transparencies, walls at 45 degree angles, multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces, and other aspects. Ultima Underworld was the first video game to implement many of these effects. The game {{was also the first}} indoor, real-time, 3D first-person game to allow the player to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, and to jump.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp illuminates the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice cleats provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E

50|$|Vervet monkeys are {{the typical}} example of both animal alarm calls and of {{semantic}} capacity in non-human animals. They have three distinct calls for leopards, snakes, and eagles, and {{research shows that}} each call elicits different responses. When vervets {{are on the ground}} they respond to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running to cover, to leopard alarm calls primarily by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running into a tree, and to the snake alarm call primarily by looking down. When in trees vervets responded to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and running out of trees, to the leopard alarm call by running higher in the tree <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, and to the snake alarm call by looking primarily down.|$|R

5|$|Three {{days before}} the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School {{obtained}} copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, where the state finals were being held. The team was therefore able to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> memorize the answers. The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

25|$|Wright was {{an early}} and {{prolific}} exponent of broadcasting, making frequent radio appearances in operetta, plays and musical comedies on the BBC. In October and November 1927, for example, he starred in complete transmissions of Miss Hook of Holland, The Cousin from Nowhere, and The Rose of Persia and he sustained a similar pattern of frequent broadcasting {{for the rest of}} his career. He also appeared in several films, including the film version of San Toy (1902), Going Straight (1933), The Empress and I (1933), Ich und Die Kaiserin (1933), Heart Song (1933), The Only Girl (1934), and <b>Look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Laugh (1935), as well as an early television production of The Little Father of the Wilderness (1939).|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld {{has been}} cited as the first {{role-playing}} game to feature first-person action in a 3D environment, and it introduced technological innovations such as allowing the player to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. Its design combines simulation elements with concepts from earlier CRPGs, including Wizardry and Dungeon Master, which led the game's designers {{to call it a}} [...] "dungeon simulation". As such, the game is non-linear and allows for emergent gameplay.|$|E

"Most {{guys are}} relaxed, but I <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> I see Kellen, and he's... going 110 miles an hour," [...] said 2013–14 Butler Bulldogs first year head coach Brandon Miller during an August {{overseas}} basketball tour. [...] "Sprinting {{up and down}} the court. Shooting pull-ups. Going as hard and as fast as he possible can. He goes at a pace, whether its shootaround in Australia, 17 minutes into practice or two hours into practice, that never changes." ...|$|E

Bowen operated the radar and made several approaches from various points. Dowding was impressed, {{and asked for a}} demonstration of the minimum range. He instructed Bowen to have the pilot hold position once they had made their closest approach on the radar scope so they could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> see how close that really was. Bowen relates the outcome: ...|$|E
500|$|Animals {{that live}} in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give {{different}} calls depending {{on the nature of}} the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a [...] "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.|$|E
500|$|Bungie's {{next project}} {{began as a}} sequel to Pathways into Darkness, but evolved into a futuristic first person shooter called Marathon. Not only did it {{introduce}} the rocket jumping mechanic to gamers {{for the first time}} (then known as [...] "grenade hopping"), it was the first control system where players could use the mouse to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down as well as pan side-to-side. Pathways had taught Bungie the importance of story in a game, and Marathon featured computer terminals where players could choose {{to learn more about the}} game's fiction. The studio became what one employee termed [...] "your stereotypical vision of a small computer-game company—eating a lot of pizza, drinking a lot of Coke" [...] while the development team worked 14 hours every day for nearly six months.|$|E

500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Dark Forces was {{commonly}} called a [...] "Doom clone," [...] {{but the game}} makes significant expansions upon the gameplay features present in Doom. New gameplay mechanisms that were not common {{at the time of}} release include the ability to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, duck, jump, and swim. The use of multiple floor levels is another technical advance in the first-person shooter genre. To produce these new features, the developers wrote a game engine from scratch. The Jedi game engine can create gameplay and graphical elements such as fully 3D objects, atmospheric effects such as fog and haze, animated textures and shading. Stinnett indicated that the developers wanted these elements to be part of an [...] "active environment," [...] and features were included to create this: [...] "ships come and go at the flight decks, rivers sweep along, platforms and conveyor belts move and much of the machinery functions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Raven Software {{released}} Heretic, {{which used}} {{a modified version}} of the Doom engine that allowed for vertical aiming, an inventory system to store and select items, and gibs. On the Macintosh, Bungie's release, in the same year, of Marathon, and its subsequent sequels, set the standard for first-person shooters on that platform. Marathon pioneered or was an early adopter of several new features such as freelook, dual-wielded and dual-function weapons, versatile multiplayer modes (such as King of the Hill, Kill the Man with the Ball, and cooperative play), friendly NPCs, and a strong emphasis on storytelling in addition to the action. [...] was released in 1995 after LucasArts decided Star Wars would make appropriate material for a game in the style of Doom. However, Star Wars: Dark Forces added several technical features that Doom lacked, such as the ability to crouch or <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, Apogee's Duke Nukem 3D, released in 1996, was [...] "the last of the great, sprite-based shooters" [...] winning acclaim for its humor based around stylised machismo as well as its gameplay. However, some found the game's (and later the whole series') treatment of women to be derogatory and tasteless.|$|E

500|$|Wiesenthal wrote {{a number}} of books, some of which contain {{conflicting}} stories and tales, {{many of which were}} invented. Several authors, including Segev and British author Guy Walters, feel that Wiesenthal's autobiographies are not reliable sources of information about his life and activities. For example, Wiesenthal would describe two people fighting over one of the lists he had prepared of survivors of the Holocaust; the two <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> recognise each other and have a tearful reunion. In one account it is a man and wife, and in another telling it is two brothers. Wiesenthal's memoirs variously claim he had spent time in as many as eleven concentration camps; the actual number was five. A drawing he made in 1945 that he claimed was a scene he witnessed in Mauthausen had actually been sketched from photos that appeared in Life magazine that June. He particularly over-emphasised his role in the capture of Eichmann, claiming that he prevented Veronika Eichmann from having her husband declared dead in 1947, when in fact the declaration was denied [...] "at the instigation of the authorities." [...] Wiesenthal said that he had retained his Eichmann file when he sent his research materials to Yad Vashem in 1952; in fact he sent all his materials there, and it was his counterpart, Tuviah Friedman in Vienna, who had retained materials on Eichmann. Isser Harel, director of the Mossad at the time, has stated that Wiesenthal had no role in the capture of Eichmann.|$|E
