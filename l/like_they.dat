5|$|Christian metal {{groups such}} as Barnabas and Extol have criticized bands within the {{industry}} {{for a lack of}} innovation and for isolating bands within the industry. Pastor Bob Beeman of Sanctuary International stated that this is a compliment to secular music, as it lets people to listen to the music they enjoyed without feeling <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are giving up on the style they love and allows bands to crossover into mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each team member feeling <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have an impact.|$|E
5|$|The street {{kept its}} '½' until 1906, when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council {{to change the}} street's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the '½' made them feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> lived in an alley. For an unknown reason, the street's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue, but to Milwaukee Avenue. The Avenue's {{proximity}} to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause.|$|E

5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would not sound <b>like</b> <b>they</b> came from a specific area of the world, instead sound <b>like</b> <b>they</b> came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Ned {{learn how}} to {{appropriately}} express emotions. After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it <b>like</b> <b>they</b> probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it would look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E

25|$|By X3, the X-Universe {{consists}} of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations {{and up to}} four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player to go where <b>they</b> <b>like,</b> when <b>they</b> <b>like,</b> doing whatever <b>they</b> like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources.

5|$|Many {{basketball}} commentators picked UTEP to {{pull the}} upset, and at halftime it looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> might be right, as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens {{made a number of}} halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59. Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had scored a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell.

Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one.

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are wearing armor, {{as they have}} two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

Alabama rebounded on their next drive that was capped with a five-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that extended their lead to 49–35. A four-yard touchdown pass from Manziel to Kennedy in the last 0:20 made the final score 49–42. Alabama recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the win.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|Greene missed {{four games}} in 1975 {{due to a}} pinched nerve, {{snapping}} a streak of 91 straight games started since he entered the league. In December 1975, {{he and the other}} members of the Steel Curtain appeared on the cover of Time magazine. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl X, Greene missed the first several games of the 1976 season with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 and looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> would not make the playoffs. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was also injured and was replaced by rookie Mike Kruczek. Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over nine games. The Steelers were defeated by the Raiders in that year's AFC championship game.|$|E
