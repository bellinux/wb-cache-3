5|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway. It {{continues}} across {{the northern edge}} of the county and the southern fringe of Lake Ontario, meeting the northern terminus of NY63 in Yates Center, north of Lyndonville. While NY63 ends here, Lyndonville Road continues north to the lake as County Route63-1 (CR63-1). This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY63. In Carlton, NY18 intersects the northern terminus of NY279, the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of northsouth routes that terminate at NY18. Not far to the east, the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. At this point, the Seaway Trail leaves NY18 to follow the parkway along the lakeshore.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is an {{artillery}} fort {{built in the}} 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack. It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river, at a location near East Tilbury that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders. It was the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of fortifications {{dating back to the}} 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid-19th century fort built on the same site. Constructed during a period of tension with France, its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process. The fort was equipped with a variety of large-calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time, including shell-proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast-iron shields. However, its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion.|$|E

5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay.

He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E

5|$|The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) is an {{extinct species}} of mammoth that {{inhabited}} North America {{as far north}} as the northern United States and as far south as Costa Rica during the Pleistocene epoch.

The Columbian mammoth evolved from the steppe mammoth, which entered North America from Asia about 1.5 million years ago. The pygmy mammoths of the Channel Islands of California evolved from Columbian mammoths. The closest extant relative of the Columbian and other mammoths is the Asian elephant.|$|E

5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a shout. The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player of their role in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line of mammoth species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Hudah was a {{powerful}} and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April2000. It was the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March22, within the Australian region cyclone basin. Moving westward {{as the result of}} a strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category2 cyclone intensity on March25 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Réunion. Nonetheless, Météo-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March27 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On April1, the MFR upgraded it to a very intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10minute winds of 225km/h (140mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1minute winds of 235km/h (145mph). Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April2. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April5 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10minute winds of 160km/h (100mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April8, and dissipated by the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Staying true to {{his word}} from earlier in the season, the match was Schmeichel's <b>last</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Manchester United shirt, and a month later he signed for Lisbon club Sporting Clube de Portugal. He spent two seasons in Portugal before {{returning}} to England for spells with Aston Villa and Manchester City. It was also Jesper Blomqvist's last competitive appearance for the club. After playing in all four matches of the club's pre-season tour of Australia and China in July 1999, he suffered a succession of knee injuries that ruled him out of competitive action {{for the next two}} seasons. He made two more appearances for the first team during the 2000–01 pre-season campaign, as well as three matches for the reserves in September and October 2001, before a free transfer to Everton in November that year. For Bayern Munich, substitutes Thomas Helmer and Ali Daei left the club in the summer of 1999, with Helmer moving to England to play for Sunderland and Daei remaining in Germany with Hertha BSC.|$|E
