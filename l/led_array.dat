2500|$|Strobe tuners (the popular {{term for}} {{stroboscopic}} tuners) {{are the most}} accurate type of tuner. There are three types of strobe tuners: the mechanical rotating disk strobe tuner, an <b>LED</b> <b>array</b> strobe {{in place of the}} rotating disk, and [...] "virtual strobe" [...] tuners with LCDs or ones that work on personal computers. A strobe tuner shows the difference between a reference frequency and the musical note being played. Even the slightest difference between the two shows up as a rotating motion in the strobe display. The accuracy of the tuner is only limited by the internal frequency generator. The strobe tuner detects the pitch either from a TRS input jack or a built-in or external microphone connected to the tuner.|$|E

These include chip bonding of micro-LED chips onto a substrate, considered to have potential for large displays; wafer production methods using etching to produce an <b>LED</b> <b>array</b> followed by bonding to an IC and wafer production methods using an intermediate temporary thin film to transfer the <b>LED</b> <b>array</b> to a substrate.|$|E

40|$|A {{strategy}} for fabricating bendable AlGaInP {{light emitting diode}} (<b>LED)</b> <b>arrays</b> is presented in this paper. Sample <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> with 8 × 8 pixels were fabricated and subjected to bending. Bending only weakly affected the light output power and the current–voltage characteristics of the <b>arrays.</b> <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> suffer from a thermal problem owing to the energy loss during the electrical-to-optical energy conversion. We have designed a three-dimensional heat conduction model for analyzing {{the effect of the}} polymer substrate, the configuration of pixels, and the micro-structure on heat dissipation in bendable <b>LED</b> <b>arrays.</b> Thermal conductivity of the polymer substrate critically affected the heat dissipation, suggesting that the substrate thickness should be in the 500 – 1000 μm range. A larger pixel distance yielded more distributed heat sources and more uniform temperature distribution. Micro-structured polymer substrates yielded lower temperature, especially for the fins array micro-structure. Based on enhancing the polymer’s thermal conductivity and distributing LED pixels, optimizing the substrate’s micro-structure is an effective method to improve heat dissipation in bendable <b>LED</b> <b>arrays.</b> Optimized heat dissipation could effectively reduce heat accumulation in <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> and alleviate an increase in the junction temperature, allowing to increase the output power of the device...|$|R

Images of artificial defects in a carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite sample are compared, by image contrast signal-to-noise ratio estimates, with those obtained using conventional incandescent flash and lock-in excitation sources.

50|$|A {{computerized}} driver system reads data, typically characters, {{and flips}} the appropriate discs {{to produce the}} desired display. Some displays use {{the other end of}} the solenoid to actuate a reed switch, which controls an <b>LED</b> <b>array</b> behind the disc, resulting in a display that is visible at night but requires no extra drive electronics.|$|E
50|$|A MIRT device {{consists}} of a timer circuit connected to an infrared <b>LED</b> <b>array.</b> The timer causes the infrared LEDs to strobe at specific frequencies, such as 10Hz for low priority (buses) or 14 Hz for high priority (emergency vehicles). Low priority transmitters will control the intersection to perform a normal light change, while high priority transmitters will change an entire intersection immediately.|$|E
40|$|The {{steady-state}} and transient {{behaviors of}} packaged IR <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> {{have been studied}} via numerical simulations. The waste heat generated by LEDs must be removed through a cold plate or a cryogenic cold finger attached to the backside of the driver array. Therefore, this heat must travel across the LED array-driver interface and through the driver array. The modeling results demonstrate that the thermal resistance of these components can be significant. The steady-state temperature profiles across several configurations are used to identify the thermal bottlenecks. Transient simulations are used to quantify {{the rise and fall}} times of the IR LEDs, and the fall times can be significantly reduced by changes in the LED layout. These proposed guidelines to minimize thermal issues in <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> should result in better performing and more reliable IR <b>LED</b> <b>arrays...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractBecause light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) have the advantages of dc working voltage, high luminescent efficiency, short ignition time, high reliability and pollution free, they have substituted for incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps gradually. In order to simplify circuit complexity, an active clamp forward converter with the sequential color display (SCD) control is proposed to drive red, green and blue (RGB) <b>LED</b> <b>arrays.</b> The proposed converter has zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operations of both the main switch and the auxiliary switch, resulting in high system efficiency. Driving RGB <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> sequentially by one converter can save components and reduce cost significantly. Additionally, the pulse-width modulation (PWM) control is applied to achieve a large chromaticity variation.

The critical submicronstripe metallic electrodes, which define the emission pattern, are formed by direct LED {{writing in a}} mask-free manner. The individually addressable submicron-stripe LEDs show excellent performance {{in terms of their}} electrical characteristics (with typical turn-on voltage of 3 V, operational stability and power output up to 28 μW at 3 mA). Unlike conventional broad-sized LEDs, the efficiency droop of the submicron-stripe LED is significantly suppressed-in fact, there is no efficiency droop for current densities up to 100 A/cm 2. Furthermore, the submicron-stripe LED shows a lower temperature-dependent shift of the emission wavelength. The lateral emission width is increased with increasing injection current, resulting in a wider lateral emission size than the metallic submicron-stripe electrode. The underlying physics of these phenomena are analysed. Such submicron-stripe <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> open up promising applications in nanophotonics and bio-sensing...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of LCoS displays: three-panel and single-panel. In three-panel designs, {{there is one}} display chip per color, and the images are combined optically. In single-panel designs, one display chip shows the red, green, and blue components in succession with the observer's eyes relied upon to combine the color stream. As each color is presented, a color wheel (or an RGB <b>LED</b> <b>array)</b> illuminates the display with only red, green or blue light. If {{the frequency of the}} color fields is lower than about 540 Hz, an effect called color breakup is seen, where false colors are briefly perceived when either the image or the observer's eye is in motion. While less expensive; single-panel projectors require higher-speed display elements to process all three colors during a single frame time, and the need to avoid color breakup makes further demands on the speed of the display technology.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flashing}} yellow arrow, {{which allows}} drivers to make left turns after {{giving way to}} oncoming traffic, is becoming more widespread in the United States, particularly in Oregon, North Carolina, Virginia, Michigan (replacing their trademark [...] "red-ball" [...] flashing left-turn lights), and Las Vegas, Nevada. In the normal sequence, a protected green left-turn arrow will first change to a solid yellow arrow to indicate {{the end of the}} protected phase, then to a flashing yellow arrow, which remains flashing until the standard green light changes to yellow and red. These generally take the form of four signal sections (green, yellow, yellow arrow, red). On some newer signals, notably in the city of Bend, Oregon, the green and flashing yellow arrows emanate from the same light section {{through the use of a}} dual-colour <b>LED</b> <b>array,</b> while the solid yellow arrow is mounted above it.

5000|$|LED-backlit LCDs are not self-illuminating (unlike pure-LED systems). There {{are several}} methods of {{backlighting}} an LCD panel using LEDs, {{including the use}} of either white or RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> behind the panel and edge-LED lighting (which uses white LEDs around the inside frame of the TV and a light-diffusion panel to spread the light evenly behind the LCD panel).

The first commercial full-array LED-backlit LCD TV was the Sony Qualia 005 (introduced in 2004), which used RGB <b>LED</b> <b>arrays</b> to produce a color gamut about twice that of a conventional CCFL LCD television. This was possible because red, green and blue LEDs have sharp spectral peaks which (combined with the LCD panel filters) result in significantly less bleed-through to adjacent color channels.
