5000|$|DISC system {{consists}} of several levels of operators and data, and different {{use cases of}} <b>lineage</b> can dictate {{the level at which}} <b>lineage</b> needs to be captured. <b>Lineage</b> can be captured {{at the level of the}} job, using files and giving <b>lineage</b> tuples of form {IF i, M RJob, OF i }, <b>lineage</b> can also be captured at the level of each task, using records and giving, for example, <b>lineage</b> tuples of form {(k rr, v rr [...] ), map, (k m, v m [...] )}. The first form of <b>lineage</b> is called coarse-grain <b>lineage,</b> while the second form is called fine-grain <b>lineage.</b> Integrating <b>lineage</b> across different granularities enables users to ask questions such as “Which file read by a MapReduce job produced this particular output record?” and can be useful in debugging across different operator and data granularities within a dataflow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lineage</b> selection, {{occurs when}} the {{frequency}} of one biological <b>lineage</b> changes in frequency relative to another <b>lineage.</b> <b>Lineage</b> selection is a generalization of individual based natural selection; the stating that an allele is favored by natural selection is equivalent to stating that the <b>lineage</b> bearing the allele is favored by natural selection. For alleles with simple positive or negative fitness effects, <b>lineage</b> and individual based selection are equivalent. However, <b>lineage</b> selection can accommodate a wider array of evolutionary phenomena, such as the adaptive evolution of evolvability, altruism, and recombination. Additionally, <b>lineage</b> selection is useful in determining the effects of mutations in highly structured environments such as tumors.|$|R

40|$|<b>Lineage,</b> which {{records the}} origin of the data and the process by which the data are derived, is {{critical}} for many applications. This dissertation addresses several shortcomings of databases for supporting fine-grained <b>lineage.</b> First, frequent updates complicate <b>lineage</b> tracing. Since the data derivation may be expensive, changes in base data are not always propagated to the derived data immediately. This leads to an inconsistent state in the data and to stale <b>lineage.</b> We propose tracing <b>lineage</b> with multiple versions of data. Maintaining multiple versions of the data and their fine-grained <b>lineage</b> ensures that the <b>lineage</b> is always correct. Moreover, current methods trace <b>lineage</b> backward at users 2 ̆ 7 requests and the <b>lineage</b> then, is not stored. To enable ad hoc queries over <b>lineage,</b> we advocate tracing <b>lineage</b> for all data and storing <b>lineage</b> in databases. Unfortunately, the current backward tracing approach is not efficient for tracing <b>lineage</b> for all data. To address this problem, we formally define forward <b>lineage</b> and prove its properties. We propose new query rewriting algorithms for Selection-Projection-Join (SPJ) and Aggregation-Selection-Projection (ASPJ) queries. In addition, our technique handles bag semantics, aggregations and nested sub-queries efficiently. Further, most current techniques focus on tracing internal fine-grained <b>lineage</b> where data is produced by a set of well-defined relational operators. As data is often processed outside databases, tracing <b>lineage</b> of the data produced by a black box function is inherently difficult. We propose a novel approach that instruments the binary code to enable external <b>lineage</b> tracing. This method is superior to prior work in that it is automatic and does not require any domain knowledge. We have implemented our techniques based on PostgreSQL and established the validity of the methods by testing with real data: We support new queries through materialized lineage; the forward method for tracing internal <b>lineage</b> incurs a low overhead for tracing all data lineage; the external <b>lineage</b> tracing technique has been used in a real scientific application and was found to be highly beneficial to our collaborators. Our techniques have broadened the scope of <b>lineage,</b> improved the quality of <b>lineage,</b> and enhanced the efficiency of tracing <b>lineage.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The {{best case}} {{scenario}} {{is to use a}} local <b>lineage</b> store for every machine in the distributed system network. This allows the <b>lineage</b> store also to scale horizontally.

The <b>lineage</b> store typically stores association tables. Each actor is represented by its own association table. The rows are the associations themselves and columns represent inputs and outputs. This design solves 2 problems. It allows horizontal scaling of the <b>lineage</b> store. If a single centralized <b>lineage</b> store was used, then this information had to be carried over the network, which would cause additional network latency.

Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct <b>lineages</b> confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E

40|$|Software <b>lineage</b> {{refers to}} the {{evolutionary}} relationship among a collection of software. The goal of software <b>lineage</b> inference is to recover the <b>lineage</b> given a set of program binaries. Software <b>lineage</b> can provide extremely useful information in many security scenarios such as malware triage and software vulnerability tracking. In this paper, we systematically study software <b>lineage</b> inference by exploring four fundamental questions not addressed by prior work. First, how do we automatically infer software <b>lineage</b> from program binaries? Second, how do we measure the quality of <b>lineage</b> inference algorithms? Third, how useful are existing approaches to binary similarity analysis for inferring <b>lineage</b> in reality, and how about in an idealized setting? Fourth, what are the limitations that any software <b>lineage</b> inference algorithm must cope with? Towards these goals we build ILINE, a system for automatic software <b>lineage</b> inference of program binaries, and also IEVAL, a system for scientific assessment of <b>lineage</b> quality. We evaluated ILINE on two types of lineage— straight line and directed acyclic graph—with large-scale real-world programs: 1, 777 goodware spanning over a combined 110 years of development history and 114 malware with known <b>lineage</b> collected by the DARPA Cyber Genome program. We used IEVAL to study seven metrics to assess the diverse properties of <b>lineage.</b> Our results reveal that partial order mismatches and graph arc edit distance often yield the most meaningful comparisons in our experiments.
