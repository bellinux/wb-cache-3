5000|$|The {{environment}} {{is a key}} focus for ethical banks {{as well as for}} some conventional banks that believe adopting more environmentally ethical practices to be to their advantage. Banks operating in this field are often referred to as sustainable or green banks.In general bankers [...] "consider themselves to be in a relatively environmentally friendly industry (in terms of emissions and pollution).

A stated {{reason for this is that}} such an examination would ‘require interference’ with a client's activities." [...] While the desire not to interfere with the business of the client is valid, it could also be noted that banks are required to interfere in the business of their clients regularly to ensure that the clients’ business plan is viable before issuing them a loan. The kind of analysis that all banks partake in is termed a single bottom <b>line</b> <b>analysis</b> (this analysis only considers financial performance).

50|$|Microstrip {{is similar}} to {{stripline}} but is open above the conductor. There is no dielectric or ground plane above the transmission line, there is only dielectric and a ground plane below the line. Microstrip is a popular format, especially in domestic products, because microstrip components can be made using the established manufacturing techniques of printed circuit boards. Designers are thus able to mix discrete component circuits with microstrip components. Furthermore, since the board {{has to be made}} anyway, the microstrip components have no additional manufacturing cost. For applications where performance is more important than cost a ceramic substrate might be used instead of a printed circuit. Microstrip has another small advantage over stripline; the line widths are wider in microstrip for the same impedance and thus manufacturing tolerances and minimum width are less critical on high-impedance lines. A drawback of microstrip is that the mode of transmission is not entirely transverse. Strictly speaking, standard transmission <b>line</b> <b>analysis</b> does not apply because other modes are present, but it can be a usable approximation.|$|E
