Some studies have linked otitis media to <b>learning</b> <b>problems,</b> attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with otitis media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing. Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood otitis media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.|$|E

For the most part, children with severe <b>learning</b> <b>problems</b> and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories.

25|$|Spina bifida is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. <b>Learning</b> <b>problems</b> are relatively uncommon.|$|E

2500|$|Lightner Witmer {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} as {{the founder of}} school psychology. Witmer was a student of both Wilhelm Wundt and James Mckeen Cattell. While Wundt believed that psychology should deal with the average or typical performance, Cattell's teachings emphasized individual differences. Witmer followed Cattell's teachings and focused on learning about each individual child's needs. Witmer opened the first psychological and child guidance clinic in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer's goal was to prepare psychologists to help educators solve children's <b>learning</b> <b>problems,</b> specifically those with individual differences. Witmer became an advocate for these special children. He was not focused on their deficits per se, but rather helping them overcome them, {{by looking at the}} individual's positive progress rather than all they still could not achieve. Witmer stated that his clinic helped [...] "to discover mental and moral defects and to treat the child {{in such a way that}} these defects may be overcome or rendered harmless through the development of other mental and moral traits". He strongly believed that active clinical interventions could help to improve the lives of the individual children.|$|E

Our metric <b>learning</b> <b>problem</b> is formulated as a quadratic semi-definite programming problem (QSDP) with local neighborhood constraints, {{which is based}} on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. The local neighborhood constraints ensure that examples of the same class are separated from examples of different classes by a margin. In addition to providing an efficient algorithm to solve the metric <b>learning</b> <b>problem,</b> extensive experiments on various data sets show that our algorithm is able to produce a new distance metric to improve the performance of the classical K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm on the classification task.

From the probabilistic perspective, we show that our learning formulation is actually a MAP es-timation on all optimization variables.
