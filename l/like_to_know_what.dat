500|$|According to the Hitler's Table Talk {{recorded}} that night, the Führer commented: [...] "I distrust {{officers who}} have exaggeratedly theoretical minds. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> becomes of their theories {{at the moment}} of action". But when an officer [...] "is worthy of command", he told Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, [...] "he must be given the prerogatives corresponding to his functions". Shortly after Model's departure to Rzhev area, Hitler also stated that: [...] "Generals must be tough, pitiless men, as crabbed as mastiffs– gross-grained men, such as I have in the Party". Importantly, however, Model never challenged Hitler on political issues: a point that has been identified as the secret to their successful relationship.|$|E
500|$|Nathaniel Cary, {{the second}} pathologist, {{objected to the}} CPS's decision. Cary told The Guardian that the push had caused a {{haemorrhage}} to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease. The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as [...] "relatively minor" [...] and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told The Guardian: [...] "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to me that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, the trio {{returned}} to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in Nice and never returned. Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit. Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's militia to protect the country against reactionary attacks, and asked members of the movement whether they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the extreme left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time [...] "unemployed and dispirited... deeply resentful of the General Staff... {{in the process of}} becoming politically more radical." [...] Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as [...] "a fusion of socialism and nationalism," [...] with definite sympathies for the Soviet regime in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen. Billy Mitchell, criticized: [...] "If we are unfortunate enough to be drawn into another war, the Air Corps wouldn’t amount to much. If it is not equal to carrying the mail, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{critical}} {{topic is}} to address various {{objects in the}} book and the characters' relationships with them, such as Rebecca's diamonds or the piano Amelia values when she thinks it came from George and dismisses upon learning that Dobbin provided it. Marxist and similar schools of criticism that go further and see Thackeray condemning consumerism and capitalism, however, largely overstate their case. Thackeray is pointed in his criticism of the commodification of women in the marriage market, but his variations on Ecclesiastes's [...] "all is vanity" [...] are more personal than institutional. He also has broad sympathy with a measure of comfort and financial and physical [...] "snugness". At one point, the narrator even makes a [...] "robust defense of his lunch": [...] "It is all vanity to be sure: but who will not own to liking a little of it? I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> well-constituted mind, merely because it is transitory, dislikes roast-beef?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E
