Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances.

5|$|Hurricane Ingrid {{was one of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones, {{along with}} Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24‑hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September12 in the Gulf of Mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September16, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. The hurricane was also the <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> form in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016.|$|E
