5000|$|Professor Stefan Bernhard is {{recognized}} {{in the scientific community}} for his work in several applied fields pertaining to the interaction between light and transition metal complexes.

50|$|The {{structure}} of a QD-LED {{is similar to the}} basic design of an OLED. The major difference is that the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>devices</b> are quantum dots, such as cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals. A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting organic materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot layer, where they are captured in the quantum dot and recombine, emitting photons. The spectrum of photon emission is narrow, characterized by its full width at half the maximum value.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, Thompson {{has shown}} a very high-efficiency EP-OLED {{approaching}} 100% internal quantum efficiency.
