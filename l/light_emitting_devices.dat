5000|$|Professor Stefan Bernhard is {{recognized}} {{in the scientific community}} for his work in several applied fields pertaining to the interaction between light and transition metal complexes.

50|$|The {{structure}} of a QD-LED {{is similar to the}} basic design of an OLED. The major difference is that the <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>devices</b> are quantum dots, such as cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals. A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting organic materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot layer, where they are captured in the quantum dot and recombine, emitting photons. The spectrum of photon emission is narrow, characterized by its full width at half the maximum value.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, Thompson {{has shown}} a very high-efficiency EP-OLED {{approaching}} 100% internal quantum efficiency. The high internal phosphorescence efficiency and charge balance in the structure {{are responsible for the}} high efficiency. He also developed a new white OLED architecture that uses a fluorescent emitting dopant to harness all high energy singlet excitons for blue emission, and phosphorescent dopants to harvest lower-energy triplet excitons for green and red emission. As of now, Thompson currently holds a patent for the invention of multicolor organic <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>devices.</b> This invention relates to devices used in flat panel electronic displays.Another focus of his is on organic photovoltaics. Thompson’s research highlights recent progress in explaining molecular characteristics which result in photovoltage losses in heterojunction organic photovoltaics. In addition to this research, Thompson grows thin films to control their structure. Then with these films, he can study the nature of energy and charge propagation.
