They aimed to establish the character as [...] "a down-to-earth girl who shares many qualities with Ellie". On the relationship between Joel and Sarah, Hayes felt that they are [...] "more <b>like</b> <b>best</b> friends than father and daughter", citing their playfulness and humor with each other. Hayes felt intimidated during her audition, due to her inexperience with video game performances. She {{found it difficult to}} perform lines in the recording studio, preferring to perform them with the body movements; she believed that the latter felt more natural. To perform Sarah's death, Hayes forced herself to remember and experience previous moments in her life, such as her grandfather's death.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I <b>like</b> <b>best?</b> [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Moore {{writes in}} the e-book Metal Missionaries that during mid-1990s Christian metal [...] "ceased to play catch up (replicating secular bands) and began to {{assimilate}} into its rightful place in the Extreme music scene and the artists who played became influential in helping to define this relatively new, but growing genre." [...] With risen musical quality and more street-credibility, Christian metal and hardcore bands were signed to record labels such as Tooth and Nail, Solid State, Facedown Records as well as secular labels Metal Blade and Victory Records. Christian metal was available through non-Christian outlets; [...] "For the first time Extreme Christian music moved from the dusty back bin of the Christian book stores to the front racks at super retailers <b>like</b> <b>Best</b> Buy, Circuit City, FYE and even giant retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Hot Topic." [...] The German secular metal label Nuclear Blast Records also released Christian metal. Torodd Fuglesteg of Norway's Arctic Serenades Records has claimed: [...] "The owner of Nuclear Blast was a committed Christian and he was pushing everything with that religious agenda through Nuclear Blast. Mortification and Horde were pushed like mad by Nuclear Blast when other labels were pushing pure satanic stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout most of {{her career}} Yasuda worked on colour designs for animators who {{employed}} the use of inks and paints for their creations but she also worked with digital media and used software like Toonz for her craft. At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colours in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based {{on the availability of}} materials and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: [...] "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: [...] "What I <b>like</b> <b>best</b> is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out," [...] and [...] "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood. Colors and pictures can enhance what the situation is on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series has}} two protagonists: witty [...] "thirty-something" [...] mother Lorelai Gilmore and her {{academic}} teenage daughter Rory. Their backstory is established {{early in the}} show: Lorelai grew up in Hartford with her old money parents, Richard and Emily, but always felt stifled by this environment. She accidentally became pregnant at age sixteen, and left home a year later to raise Rory in the close-knit town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn, where she eventually progressed from maid to executive manager. Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living <b>like</b> <b>best</b> friends, and Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has formed away from her parents. In the pilot episode, she is forced to go to them when Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School but she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, {{so long as the}} girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up the show's primary conflict, as the Gilmores are forced to face their differences and complicated history. The contrasting mother–daughter relationships of Emily–Lorelai and Lorelai–Rory become a defining theme of the show.

2500|$|In the story, Lucky {{comes across}} Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) after {{she has been}} raped, and confides his upset to his father before his hostile {{half-brother}} Nikolas Cassadine (then Christopher) reveals to him that Luke had raped Laura years prior. The betrayal Lucky feels from having the truth kept from him has a drastic impact on the character, especially because of how close he had been with his parents. Having moved around often, their relationship had become more <b>like</b> <b>best</b> friends than parent-child. Lucky struggles to understand his parents' actions. Jackson described Lucky in 1999 as: [...] "a black-and-white personality. He either loves or hates people. He doesn't know about balance." [...] Lucky's relationship with each of his parents suffers; he thinks his mother is in denial about her attack, and is even more angry with his father for keeping the secret while Lucky was coping with Elizabeth's assault. Lucky moves out and his independence grows further as he crashes at various places around Port Charles while holding odd jobs and continuing his schoolwork. As {{a result of the}} ordeal, honesty becomes important to Lucky; Jackson explained to Soap Opera Digest in December 1998: [...] "He doesn't want to do what his parents did as far as keeping secrets from each other and lying. He's pretty set on doing things differently {{when it comes to the}} decisions he makes in his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 1966, Don Demeter and Julio Navarro were traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Joe Christopher and pitcher Earl Wilson. The Red Sox {{had been}} {{attempting}} anywhere from several weeks to {{several months to}} obtain Demeter, offering a combination of catcher Bob Tillman and an infielder, but the Tigers continually rejected the offers. General manager Billy Herman had known Demeter {{ever since he was}} a coach for the Dodgers several years prior. Demeter was a player Herman wanted to acquire ever since he took the manager post in September 1964. [...] "He (Demeter) is a good hitter with power. I know he will take good advantage of our left field wall." [...] He went on to say, [...] "One of the things I <b>like</b> <b>best</b> about Demeter is that I can use him at five positions. He can play anywhere in the outfield, and he can play both first and third base. Don will shake up a few people on this club." [...] Herman cited that his then current plan was to put Demeter in center field, but was also considering playing him at third base, where Joe Foy had been struggling offensively. Herman also said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.|$|E
2500|$|Brøderbund Software’s {{marketing}} strategy {{aimed at a}} target demographic: [...] "young parents who have a computer at home and want their kids to learn while playing". To do this, it created edutainment titles with [...] "entertaining graphics and sound", beta-tested them with kids to ensure they were easy to use, and had deals with retailers <b>like</b> <b>Best</b> Buy and Babbages. An MHHE document entitled Marketing’s Role within the Firm or Nonprofit Organization explained [...] "retailers are happy to give new Brøderbund products shelf space {{because they know that}} Brøderbund’s promotion will help bring customers into the store". In the case of Great Chase Through Time, Brøderbund [...] "not only placed ads in family-oriented computer magazines but also sent direct-mail flyers to its registered customers". Due to brand loyalty, Carmen Sandiego games were able to be sold for more money than software from other companies. Parents appreciated that it [...] "caters to their needs and offers good customer value". The Mirror held a promotion where they would give away 10 copies of the video game through The A List. The game was included in the TLC School Alliance, which saw its titles being sold at discount at theNSBA Conference in Nashville and the California CUE Conference in Santa Clara. James Lyband Jackson, Computer Education Coordinator for both the YWCA/Day Care and the Church, included the [...] " [...] hands-on history" [...] program as part of their education program. The School Edition of the game came with a three-ring binder to hold the software, a User's Guide, a custom-developed Teacher's Guide, and the resource book World History Simulations by Max W. Fischer.|$|E

[...] It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R" [...] The song, [...] "Joyous Sound" [...] is described by Brian Hinton as [...] "more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves." [...] Morrison said of the track, [...] "Flamingos Fly", [...] "I've done three versions in the studio. [...] I've done it slow, a ballad version. [...] I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. [...] This is the version I <b>like</b> <b>best</b> for release."
