Note {{that only a}} single treatment step of original measurement data can be selected for deconvolution at a time. Optimized deconvolution in UDECON is controlled by options and parameters set in the “ABIC Optimization” and “Deconvolution” panels located on the bottom left of the software interface. The “ABIC Optimization” panel provides two options to implement the optimized deconvolution algorithm developed by Oda and Xuan (2014): (1) the “Simplex method” and (2) the “Grid search” method.|$|E
30|$|If the <b>loaded</b> <b>measurement</b> file {{contains}} {{data for}} multiple samples, {{a list of}} samples will be shown in the “Sample” list box, and users can click on a sample or use {{the up and down}} arrow keys to navigate from one sample to another to view data of that sample. UDECON supports measurement file that contains measurement data for multiple samples, but only one sample can be selected at a time. The “Treatment” list box displays the list of treatment and measurement steps for the currently selected sample. Data from multiple treatment steps can be selected for viewing and checking simultaneously. Note that list of treatment steps of a sample includes not only measurement step data but also steps of deconvolution data added by UDECON (see “Checking deconvolved data” section). Treatment step data can be switched either by left clicking or by using the up and down arrow keys. Users can choose any combination of treatment step data by left clicking the treatment steps while holding the Shift or the Command key (or the Control key in Windows OS).|$|E
30|$|After {{format and}} {{measurement}} files are loaded, users need {{to load the}} response file (see Table  1 and “Acquisition and preparation of magnetometer sensor response” section) by clicking on the third icon on the toolbar to locate and load the response file. If the response file is appropriately formatted and successfully loaded, UDECON will automatically plot the response file data and show {{the name of the}} response file just beneath the measurement file name (Fig.  2 c). The procedures of loading format and measurement files followed by response file, are typical for deconvolution of a measurement file for the first time. If users have previously conducted deconvolution with these loaded files and saved a “.mat” file using UDECON (see “Saving deconvolution data and plots” section), deconvolution optimization analysis can be continued by directly loading the “.mat” file without loading any of the three files (see Fig.  1). The “.mat” file stores not only the deconvolution-related data but also the <b>loaded</b> <b>measurement</b> and response data. The “.mat” file can be loaded to UDECON using the fourth icon on the toolbar.|$|E

Physiological signals are relatively reliable, real-time measures of cognitive <b>load.</b> <b>Measurement</b> robustness can be improved by taking account of confounding factors, and multimodality {{has the potential to}} enhance mental load prediction. This thesis investigates cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> by means of physiological data and machine learning techniques. Skin response and eye blink are economical, conveniently-captured physiological measures that were studied. Multiple datasets were used to increase the reliability of the results which confirmed that the explored features can significantly measure different {{cognitive load}} levels. Confounding factors can distort cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> results. Emotional fluctuations have profound impacts on physiological signals. Therefore to examine the robustness of the explored features, they were evaluated for cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> with affective interference in different datasets. The results showed that they can measure multiple cognitive load levels with high accuracy even under emotional changes. Different modalities can impart complementary information. Hence we tried to improve the accuracy by means of multimodal cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement.</b> Two fusion techniques were used and different combinations of classifiers and features were examined. Multimodality proved to improve the cognitive load classification accuracy and the studied feature fusions performed well both in the absence and presence of affective stimuli. This thesis proposes frameworks for monitoring cognitive load using physiological data and machine learning techniques. The system was tested during affective fluctuations and modality fusion was performed. The outcomes of this research show that the explored features and methods could be used as means for objective, robust, accurate cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement.</b> Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|In {{the frame}} {{work of the}} project Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX), a <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System was {{developed}} and fabricated to measure the impingement force of Shuttle Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. The <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System is a force sensing system that measures any combination of normal and shear forces up to 40 N (9 lbf) in the normal direction and 22 N (5 lbf) in the shear direction with an accuracy of +/- 0. 04 N (+/- 0. 01 lbf) Since high resolution {{is required for the}} force <b>measurement,</b> the <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System is built with highly sensitive load cells. To protect these fragile load cells in the non-operational mode from being damaged due to flight loads such as launch and landing loads of the Shuttle vehicle, a motor driven device known as the Load Cell Lock-Out Mechanism was built. This Lock-Out Mechanism isolates the load cells from flight loads and re-engages the load cells for the force measurement experiment once in space.

40|$|At present, {{the cost}} of {{offshore}} wind energy {{does not meet the}} level of onshore wind and fossil-based energy sources. One way to extend the turbine lifetime, and thus reduce cost, is by reduction of the fatigue loads of blades and other turbine parts using Individual Pitch Control (IPC). This type of control, which is generally implemented by feedback control using the MultiBlade Coordinate transformation on blade <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> signals, is capable of mitigating the most dominant periodic loads. The main goal {{of this article is to}} develop a self-optimizing feedforward IPC strategy for a two-bladed wind turbine to reduce actuator duty cycle and reduce the dependency on blade <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> signals. The approach uses blade <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> data only initially for tuning of the feedforward controller, which is scheduled on the rotor azimuth angle and wind speed. The feedforward strategy will be compared to the feedback implementation in terms of load alleviation capabilities and actuator duty cycle. Results show that the implementation is capable of learning the optimal feedforward IPC controller in constant and turbulent wind conditions, to alleviate the pitch actuator duty cycle, and to considerably reduce harmonic fatigue loads without the need for blade <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> signals after tuning.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} unexpectedly erratic <b>load</b> <b>measurements</b> in the launch-pad supports for the space shuttle, the sensitivities of the load cells in the supports were analyzed using simple probabilistic techniques. NASA engineers use the loads in the shuttle's supports to calculate critical stresses in the shuttle vehicle just before lift-off. The support loads are measured with 'load cells' which are actually structural components of the mobile launch platform (MLP) which have been instrumented with strain gauges. Although these load cells adequately measure vertical loads, the horizontal <b>load</b> <b>measurements</b> have been erratic. The <b>load</b> <b>measurements</b> were simulated in this study using Monte Carlo simulation procedures.

By using the conventional normal equation (linear regression) approach, approach 1 is only valid when the number of loads is equal to or greater than the number of gages, while approach 2 is the reverse. Furthermore, except for the case of the number of loads equals the number of gages, the load prediction formulas under the two approaches are not equivalent...|$|R

The aim of this collaborative study was to evaluate the suitability of a range of candidate reference materials to harmonise EBV viral <b>load</b> <b>measurements</b> in a wide range of NAT assays. Candidate materials included lyophilised and liquid whole virus preparations of the EBV B 95 - 8 strain, and preparations of Namalwa and Raji cells.

The agreement between laboratories was improved when the potency of each candidate was expressed relative to the lyophilised B 95 - 8 preparation. The results of the study indicate the suitability of this candidate as the 1 st WHO International Standard for EBV for NAT.

With growing electric kettle ownership and usage, lack of any efficiency labelling guidelines for the kettle, slow technological progress in improving kettle efficiency relative to other domestic appliances, and current consumer attitudes, urgent investigation into consumer kettle usage patterns is warranted. From an efficiency point of view, little {{can be done about}} the kettle, which is more efficient than other methods of heating water such as the stove top kettle. However, since a majority households use the kettle inefficiently by overfilling, in order to meet energy targets, it is imperative to quantify inefficient usage and predict demand. For the purposes of scalability, we propose tools that depend only on <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> data for quantifying and visualising kettle usage and energy consumption, assessing energy wastage through overfilling via our proposed electric kettle model, and predicting kettle-specific demand, from which we can estimate potential energy savings in a household and across a housing stock.
