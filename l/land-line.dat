5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one <b>land-line</b> telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
25|$|Hitherto the New Telecom Policy was {{announced}} in 1999, only the Government-owned BSNL and MTNL were allowed to provide <b>land-line</b> phone services through copper wire in India with MTNL operating in Delhi and Mumbai and BSNL servicing all {{other areas of the}} country. Due to the rapid growth of the cellular phone industry in India, landlines are facing stiff competition from cellular operators. This has forced <b>land-line</b> service providers to become more efficient and improve their quality of service. <b>Land-line</b> connections are now also available on demand, even in high density urban areas. India has over 31 million main line customers.|$|E

Kildall's final business venture, known as Prometheus Light and Sound (PLS) and based in Austin, Texas, developed a home PBX system that integrated <b>land-line</b> telephones with mobile phones.|$|E
25|$|The Dowding {{system was}} the world's first wide-area ground-controlled {{interception}} network, controlling the airspace across the United Kingdom from northern Scotland {{to the southern}} coast of England. It used a widespread dedicated <b>land-line</b> telephone network to rapidly collect information from Chain Home (CH) radar stations and the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) {{in order to build}} a single image of the entire UK airspace and then direct defensive interceptor aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery against enemy targets. The system was built by the Royal Air Force just before the start of World War II, and proved decisive in the Battle of Britain.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, the CBC {{began running}} {{distinct}} programming on its three existing FM English-language stations, {{which had been}} providing simulcasts of programming on its AM stations. The stations, located in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, broadcast a monoaural FM signal. Programming consisted mostly of classical music. The stations were linked by CN/CP Telecommunications via <b>land-line</b> and microwave. This service was discontinued in 1962, but resumed in 1964 in stereo. Eventually, a national satellite-distributed network of stereo FM stations was established. In 1975, the FM network was called CBC Stereo, and the AM service was designated CBC Radio.|$|E

Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, {{about half of all}} children have mobile phones. In many young adults' households it has supplanted the <b>land-line</b> phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} Bay Area cities, USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL are readily {{available}} to Milpitas. The USPS post office on Abel Street is Milpitas' main office for postal mail {{and is the only}} USPS post office in the city. ZIP code 95035 is exclusively for Milpitas and is the only standard ZIP code for the city. 95036 is a new ZIP that is used sometimes for post office boxes in Milpitas. Until the merge with SBC, Milpitas had relied on Pacific Bell for its telecommunications services. American Telegraph and Telephone (AT) acquired Southern Bell (SBC) in 2006 and became the <b>land-line</b> telephone provider in the city. As part of the agreement for the merger of AT with SBC, Milpitas residents were offered high speed DSL internet access with AT for only $10 per month until December 2009, although few residents were aware of the offer.|$|E
50|$|Telegraphy {{did not go}} away on radio. Instead, {{the degree}} of {{automation}} increased. On <b>land-lines</b> in the 1930s, teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex. For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.|$|R

500|$|In {{the absence}} of {{government}} service provision and regulation, private businessmen stepped in to provide telecommunications and mail services.

[...] According to the CIA World Factbook, private telephone companies [...] "offer service in most major cities" [...] via wireless technology, charging [...] "the lowest international rates on the continent", Installation time for a <b>land-line</b> was just three days, while in the neighboring Kenya waiting lists were many years long. On the other hand, just 0.7% of the population of Somalia had access to internet in 2006, a sixth of Kenya's internet penetration at the time, and in 2007 mobile phone penetration rates in Somalia were amongst the lowest in Africa.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, McCaw Cellular {{introduced}} SS7 signaling {{across their}} network. Prior to this, each cell tower {{in the network}} connected to local signaling, billing and sets of <b>land-lines.</b> Since only the towers in the area local to the customer's home had access to dialing and routing information, when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them. With the introduction of SS7 signaling, the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network (known technically as Non-Facility Associated Signalling), tying it together into a single national network. They called the new system [...] "Cellular One", and introduced the concept of roaming charges. That year, McCaw earned $54 million, making him America's highest-paid chief executive.|$|R
5|$|The Luftwaffes {{target was}} the Marfee heights which lay behind Sedan {{to the south}} east. They {{contained}} the fortified artillery positions and dominated the approaches to the strategic and operational depths beyond Sedan and the Meuse. The Luftwaffe was two hours late in appearing but the effort made was considerable. The attacks were made in Gruppe (group) strength and against the line of maximum resistance along the enemy gun line. To restrict enemy movements and communications, German fighters swept the area to cut <b>land-lines</b> and strafe fortifications, with some shooting of radio antennae off command posts. The attacks isolated the forward defence lines. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 struck first {{in the morning of}} 13 May. In just five hours, 500 Ju 87 sorties had been flown.|$|R
2500|$|Electrical {{engineering}} {{became a}} profession {{in the later}} 19th century. [...] Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline. [...] Although {{it is impossible to}} precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of <b>land-lines,</b> submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.|$|R

5000|$|Under this pressure, {{after the}} 1922 General Election, the Conservative {{government}} commissioned the Empire Wireless Committee, chaired by Sir Robert Donald, to [...] "consider and advise upon the policy {{to be adopted}} as regards an Imperial wireless service so as to protect and facilitate public interest." [...] Its report {{was presented to the}} Postmaster-General on 23 February 1924 The committee's recommendations were {{similar to those of the}} Norman Committee - that any stations in Great Britain used to communicate with the Empire should be in the hands of the State, that they should be operated by the Post Office, and that eight high-power longwave stations should be used, as well as <b>land-lines.</b> The scheme was estimated at £500,000. At the time the committee was unaware of Marconi's 1923 experiments into shortwave radio transmissions, which offered a much cheaper alternative - although not a commercially proven one - to high-power long-wave transmission system.|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using <b>land-lines</b> wherever possible.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} {{two major}} mobile phone categories: {{cell phones and}} smartphones. In addition to voice communication and text messaging capabilities, cell phones can include features such as digital cameras and radio receivers. Smartphones share these features, but have also become powerful computing machines that can handle complex tasks and accommodate a wider array of human-centric sensor devices (Srivastava et al. 2012). Those capabilities are increasingly explored {{through the development of}} software applications across a vast array of themes, including those useful for emergency preparedness and response (West & Valentini 2013). However, cell phones are cheaper, have more energy autonomy, and are still the device of choice among developing nations and regions, and more vulnerable populations (like the elderly), so they should not be overlooked for planning and preparedness purposes. Moreover, while some smartphone apps are also useful off-line, they still require access to a data network to be installed or run, hindering their usefulness when data transfer is not possible. Other communication devices such as tablets, computers and <b>land-lines</b> share several of the capabilities mentioned. However, the ubiquity of mobile phones at all times makes them uniquely suited as a critical resource for assistance in unexpected and disruptive scenarios, hence we will focus mainly on these devices.|$|R
2500|$|Landlines use an open {{dialling}} plan: if the caller's phone {{shares the}} same area code as the called phone, the area code may be omitted. For example, {{a call from the}} number (02)55515678, to the number (02)70101111, will be connected if the caller dials only 70101111. Similarly, a person who dials 70105678 on a <b>land-line</b> or mobile phone in Melbourne (i.e., within the 03 area) will be connected to 0370105678. For this reason, landline numbers are often specified without the area code. If a person's number and the destination number share {{the same area}} code, then the area code is not required, even if it is not a [...] "local" [...] (untimed) call.|$|E
2500|$|Changes in Luftwaffe {{methods and}} {{objectives}} were communicated via <b>land-line</b> {{but at times}} could be inferred from Enigma decrypts that changes were afoot. The code-name Adlertag and references to the period from [...] were uncovered but not its purpose. As the Kanalkampf continued, Enigma gave more notice of targets, timing and the size raids but this was sometimes too late to be useful and Luftwaffe changes at short-notice could negate the information. Tactical information from Enigma was not well co-ordinated with RAF Y-stations (RAF Y), which reported separate to Enigma but RAF Y {{was able to give}} warnings of German sightings of coastal convoys and imminent attacks, by eavesdropping on and decrypting Luftwaffe wireless transmissions between aircraft and the ground. RAF Y identified airborne bomber units and their bases, occasionally also uncovering the target area, although it was mid-August before this added much to RDF reports.|$|E
60|$|Hurrying forward, {{they came}} upon a {{remarkable}} and picturesque scene. The engineers of the Great Eastern had chosen the previous day for the laying of the mile of <b>land-line,</b> with which the cable was to be connected. The burying of it in its appointed home had commenced at half-past six {{in the evening and}} had continued all through the night. It was about 2 a.m. when our adventurers came upon the scene. The trench was cut through ground on which a number of soldiers were encamped, whose white tents looked ghostlike in the feeble star-light, and lines of naked natives were seen, waving lanterns, pushing along the mysterious cable, or, with hands and feet busily pressing down the loose soil that covered the buried portion.|$|E
40|$|ORBCOMM, a {{subsidiary}} of Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), has designed a system to provide low-cost mobile two-way data communications for worldwide commercial markets. The primary application areas are data communications and messaging. The ORBCOMM System has been designed so a user can compose, transmit, and receive messages; control and monitor assets; and collect data on hand-held subscriber communicators (SC's). With a constellation of 36 LEO satellites and terrestrial facilities, users in the temperature climate zones {{around the world will}} have a satellite in view over 98 % of the time, and will have to wait less than two minutes {{the rest of the time}} to directly access a satellite. A message transmitted from a SC and received by the satellite is relayed down to a regional gateway earth station (GES). The GES then transmits the message via fiber <b>land-lines</b> to the network control center (NCC). The NCC then determines the location of the recipient of the message and routes the message accordingly. The NCC can receive and transmit messages from terrestrial networks via X. 400 and X. 25 gateways. The NCC can translate messages from widely used e-mail systems such as Internet, cc:Mail, and Microsoft Mail into X. 400 messages for transmission to and from ORBCOMM SC's...|$|R
40|$|To enjoy modern {{information}} technology applications for development such as e-medicine, tele-edcuation, e-government and e-commerce, the engineering management and information systems literature have vastly {{argued that there}} exist technological and non-technological precursors to successful diffusion of such applications. Factors such as training local expertise and open competition that could {{be taken for granted}} in developed nations cannot just be ignored in the case of developing economies. The main measure of a nation’s telecommunications infrastructure is teledensity—the number of main telecommunications <b>land-lines</b> per 100 people. Africa’s Least Developed Economies (LDEs), home to 33 of the 48 LDEs of the world, continue to suffer from poor telecommunications infrastructure. For most countries within this region, less than one telephone line is shared among 100 inhabitants, a serious hindrance in building other basic infrastructure such as the Internet and related technologies. For example, Congo and Eritrea still have less than 0. 5 line per 100 people. This study examines the perceptions of Africa’s technology stakeholders to solve the poor telecommunications infrastructure problems that hinder diffusion of relevant applications within the region. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected and reported in this study. Findings reveal six pertinent factors (strategies) that would impact teledensity growth in Africa’s LDEs: (1) Promot...|$|R
40|$|Since ancient times, {{water has}} been {{considered}} a vital resource for the survivability of nations. It is a resource that calls for impregnable security and incessant protection. Water infrastructures generally consist of dams and associated water-supply systems. These infrastructures are vulnerable {{to a number of}} natural and man-made disasters. The threat of natural calamities such as cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis and man-made disasters like terrorist attacks are now more imminent than ever. In spite of these facts, water infrastructures are still being provided with meagre communication support like <b>land-lines</b> and mobile phones for use in normal and emergency scenarios. These communication resources are in fact vulnerable to the very same catastrophes as those threatening the water infrastructures. In this paper we present a communication infrastructure based on wireless mesh networks, which can satisfy the two main communication requirements of any water infrastructure, i. e. surveillance and crisis communications. This paper has been mainly written with Australian water infrastructures in mind. However, emphasise is made on the application of the proposed communication network being applicable to any water infrastructure. We argue that wireless mesh networks can provide the requisite dual-role communication functionality for water infrastructures, even in the advent of severe calamities or disasters...|$|R
