5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the <b>local</b> <b>operation</b> of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E
25|$|A major, nearly {{billion dollar}} {{expansion}} and improvements were {{undertaken by the}} county and airport authority in 1987 {{at the request of}} US Airways, which operated a hub there and took on major financing of the changes. The new facilities opened in 1992 and have been ranked highly by travelers and industry journals, with some of the design becoming a model for other airports. In the early 21st century, airlines struggled with changing financial conditions, and US Airways began scaling down its <b>local</b> <b>operation,</b> shifting to Philadelphia and Charlotte. It was carrying debt and was unable to negotiate the terms for lower landing fees at the airport. Its reduction in flights {{through the end of the}} decade resulted in the partial closure of two concourses.|$|E

40|$|We study when a {{multipartite}} non [...] <b>local</b> unitary <b>operation</b> can deterministically or probabilistically simulate {{another one}} when <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> {{of a certain}} kind -eventually including also classical communication- are allowed. In the case of probabilistic simulation and allowing for arbitrary <b>local</b> <b>operations,</b> we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the simulation to be possible. Deterministic and probabilistic interconversion under certain kinds of <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> are used to define equivalence relations between gates. In the probabilistic, bipartite case this induces a finite number of classes. In multiqubit systems, however, two unitary operations typically cannot simulate each other with non-zero probability of success. We also show which kind of entanglement can be created by a given non [...] <b>local</b> unitary <b>operation</b> and generalize our results to arbitrary operators...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{conditions}} under which <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> and classical communication enable entanglement transformations between bipartite pure Gaussian states. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions had been found [G. Giedke, Quant. Inf. Comput. 3, 211 (2003) ] for the interconversion between such states that is restricted to Gaussian <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> and classical communication. Here, we exploit majorization theory in order to derive more general (sufficient) conditions for the interconversion between bipartite pure Gaussian states that goes beyond Gaussian <b>local</b> <b>operations.</b> While our technique is applicable to an arbitrary number of modes for each party, it allows us to exhibit surprisingly simple examples of 2 × 2 Gaussian states that necessarily require non-Gaussian <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> to be transformed into each other.

40|$|Multi-party <b>local</b> quantum <b>operations</b> with shared quantum {{entanglement}} or shared classical randomness are studied. The following facts are established: (i) There is {{a ball of}} <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared randomness lying within the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely noisy channel. (ii) The existence of the ball of <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared randomness is employed {{to prove that the}} weak membership problem for <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard. (iii) <b>Local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared entanglement are characterized in terms of linear functionals that are ``completely'' positive on a certain cone K of separable Hermitian operators, under a natural notion of complete positivity appropriate to that cone. <b>Local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared randomness (but not entanglement) are also characterized in terms of linear functionals that are merely positive on that same cone K. (iv) Existing characterizations of no-signaling operations are generalized to the multi-party setting and recast in terms of the Choi-Jamiolkowski representation for quantum super-operators. It is noted that the standard nonlocal box {{is an example of a}} no-signaling operation that is separable, yet cannot be implemented by <b>local</b> <b>operations</b> with shared entanglement.
