25|$|The avocado (Persea americana) is a tree long {{thought to}} have {{originated}} in South Central Mexico, classified {{as a member of}} the flowering plant family Lauraceae. Recent archaeological research produced evidence that the avocado was present in Peru as long as 8,000 to 15,000 years ago. Avocado (also alligator pear) refers to the tree's fruit, which is botanically a large berry containing a single <b>large</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The key to {{the early}} renown of the raintree stemmed from the {{apocryphal}} story {{that it was a}} panacea for drought stricken districts through the ability of its leaves to condense moisture out of the air, retain it in large quantities and then expel it through its leaves and trunk. This story, and how it had been disproved, was discussed in two 1911 articles from the Port Douglas and Mossman Record. Otherwise it was seriously considered as a useful crop for the fodder its <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> pods provided for cattle.|$|E

25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{was used}} as an {{ornamental}} plant in European gardens at least as far back as 1773. It was in common use in 1828, and Charles Darwin grew it in his garden in the 1840s. The plant is still widely used in gardens in Europe and Asia because of its striking black flowers. It is also used to add height to a garden, and as a means of providing a darker backdrop to more brightly colored plants and flowers. The <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> pods weather winter well (tending not to drop in high wind), and it can be a striking winter ornamental seedpod plant as well. However, it is difficult to find and very expensive in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The native, undomesticated {{variety is}} known as a criollo, and is small, with dark black skin, and {{contains}} a <b>large</b> <b>seed.</b> It probably coevolved with extinct megafauna. [...] The avocado tree also {{has a long history of}} cultivation in Central and South America, likely beginning as early as 5,000 BC. A water jar shaped like an avocado, dating to AD 900, was discovered in the pre-Incan city of Chan Chan.|$|E
2500|$|Modern-day G. biloba grows best in {{environments that}} are well-watered and drained, and the {{extremely}} similar fossil Ginkgo favored similar environments: the sediment record at {{the majority of}} fossil ginkgo localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed environments along streams and levees. ginkgo, therefore, presents an [...] "ecological paradox" [...] because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits (slow growth, <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> size, late reproductive maturity) are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{another study}} by Marzluff and Balda [...] in Flagstaff, Arizona, {{survivorship}} of all age classes of pinyon jays was more strongly correlated with weather than with pinyon seed crop variations. Juveniles and yearlings {{had a better}} chance of survival when spring weather was warm and wet and pinyon crops were large compared to snowy springs and poor pinyon seed crops. Adults survived better during warm, wet, spring weather also but experienced highest survival during intermediate versus large pinyon seed crops. This may have been due to increased activity during harvest in <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> crop years and increased exposure to predators.|$|E
2500|$|Prunus persica {{grows to}} [...] tall and 6 in. in diameter. The leaves are lanceolate, [...] long, [...] broad, pinnately veined. The flowers are {{produced}} {{in early spring}} before the leaves; they are solitary or paired, 2.5–3cm diameter, pink, with five petals. The fruit has yellow or whitish flesh, a delicate aroma, and a skin that is either velvety (peaches) or smooth (nectarines) in different cultivars. The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties, especially when green. The single, <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> is red-brown, oval shaped, approximately 1.3–2cm long, and {{is surrounded by a}} wood-like husk. Peaches, along with cherries, plums and apricots, are stone fruits (drupes). There are various heirloom varieties, including the Indian Peach, or Indian Blood Peach, which arrives {{in the latter part of}} the summer, and can have color ranging from red and white, to purple.|$|E
60|$|This Plant, {{when young}} and {{springing}} up, does much resemble a Housleek, having thick leaves, almost like that, {{and seems to}} be somwhat of kin to it in other particulars; also {{from the top of the}} leaves, there shoots out a small white and transparent hair, or thorn: This stem, in time, come to shoot out into a long, round and even stalk, which by cutting transversly, when dry, I manifestly found to be a stiff, hard, and hollow Cane, or Reed, without any kind of knot, or stop, from its bottom, where the leaves encompass'd it, to the top, on which there grows a <b>large</b> <b>seed</b> case, A, cover'd with a thin, and more whitish skin, B, terminated in a long thorny top, which at first covers all the Case, and by degrees, as that swells, the skin cleaves, and at length falls off, with its thorny top and all (which is a part of it) and leaves the seed Case to ripen, and by degrees, to shatter out its seed at a place underneath this cap, B, which before the seed is ripe, appears like a flat barr'd button, without any hole in the middle; but as it ripens, the button grows bigger, and a hole appears in the middle of it, E, out of which, in all probability, the seed falls: For as it ripens by a provision of Nature, that end of this Case turns downward after the same manner as the ears of Wheat and Barley usually do; and opening several of these dry red Cases, F, I found them to be quite hollow, without anything at all in them; whereas when I cut them asunder with a sharp Pen-knife when green, I found in the middle of this great Case, another smaller round Case, between which two, the interstices were fill'd with multitudes of stringie fibres, which seem'd to suspend the lesser Case in the middle of the other, which (as farr as I was able to discern) seem'd full of exceeding small white seeds, much like the seed-bagg in the knop of a Carnation, after the flowers have been two or three days, or a week, fallen off; but this I could not so perfectly discern, and therefore cannot positively affirm it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Several {{previous}} studies have observed that species and individuals with <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> respond more positively to ele-vated CO 2 than those with small seeds. We explored {{the reasons for this}} pattern by examining the relationship between seed size and CO 2 response in Picea abies and P. rubens using growth anal-ysis. The <b>large</b> <b>seeded</b> species (P. abies) responded more posi-tively to elevated CO 2 than the small seeded species (P. rubens). At the intraspecific level, P. abies individuals from <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> re-sponded more positively to elevated CO 2 than individuals from small seeds, however, there was no significant intraspecific var-iation in CO 2 response in P. rubens. The greater CO 2 response of plants from <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> was not simply the result of a larger starting capital compounded {{at the same rate as}} in plants from small seeds. Elevated CO 2 increased relative growth rate to a greater extent in individuals from <b>large</b> <b>seeds.</b> This effect ap-pears to be related to differences in time of establishment, source to sink ratio and nutrient availability with seed size. These results are significant not only in understanding the po-tential effect of rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on plant populations, but also in understanding the factors affecting plant success at current atmospheric CO 2 levels due to the eleva-tion of CO 2 within the litter layer that occurs at many germina-tion sites...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Safflower is an {{important}} oilseed crop and is largely grown for edible oil production in low moisture or salt-affected soils of Turkey. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out the quality of seeds with different sized seeds, and the effects of seed size (3, 4 and 5 mm) and NaCl stresses at electrical conductivities of 5, 10, 20 and 30 dS m- 1 on the germina-tion and early seedling growth of the safflower cultivar Dinçer. Our results show that heavier one-thousand-seed weight (70. 5 g) and higher hull percentage (52. 9 %) were obtained from <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> while the oil content and water uptake of small seeds was higher than that of medium or <b>large</b> <b>seeds.</b> Germination percentage, germination time, root length, shoot length, and seedling fresh and dry weight showed size-dependent responses of the seeds to salt stress. In general, medium-sized (4 mm) seeds germinated more rapidly compared to small and <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> against all levels of salt stress; however, the highest germination percentage and most vigorous seedling growth was recorded from <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> after 10 days incubation. The inhibitory effect of NaCl levels was exhibited a drastic effect on seedling growth. Increased NaCl resulted in an increase in the Na+ and Cl- content of the seedlings produced by all seed sizes, while the K+ content was not changed. However, the seedlings from small seeds had the highest Na+ and Cl- content of all measured NaCl levels. It was concluded that <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> produced vigorous seedling growth due to a lower ion accumulation under NaCl stress. Consequently, <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> could be used for successful stand establishment in contrast to their slow germination performance if the cultivation of safflower on saline soils is required...|$|R

40|$|A {{sub-sample}} of lentil (Lens culinaris ‘Kimia’) seeds {{was kept}} as bulk (S 1) and another sample was separated to large (S 2) and small (S 3) seeds. A sub-sample of each size was kept as control or high vigor seed lot (A 1) {{and the two}} other sub-samples were artificially aged for 2 and 4 days (A 2 and A 3, respectively). Field performance of these seeds was evaluated during 2011 and 2012. Yield components and grain yield of lentil decreased with decreasing water availability. The highest yield components (except 1000 grain weight) and grain yield per unit area were obtained by plants from <b>large</b> <b>seeds.</b> The superiority of plants from <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> in grain yield was more evident under limited irrigations than under well watering. Seed aging resulted in poor stand establishment and consequently low grain yield per unit area. Plants from aged <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> showed the lowest reduction in grain yield per unit area, compared with those from aged small and bulk seeds. It seems that cultivation of <b>large</b> <b>seeds</b> somehow can reduce the deleterious effects of drought stress and seed aging on grain yield per unit area of lentil. </p...|$|R
