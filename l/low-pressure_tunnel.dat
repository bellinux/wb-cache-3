50|$|The {{penstocks}} are 5.3 m {{in diameter}} and 630 m in length. They carry water from the upper reservoir to the power station through the high-pressure tunnel. The water intake, located on the Liaussac Embankment (next to the Monn√®s Dam), has two sluice gates which allow the high-pressure tunnel to be closed off. Once the water has passed through the turbines, it is evacuated through the 541 m <b>low-pressure</b> <b>tunnel</b> towards the Couesques Reservoir.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{viscosity}} effect some experiments {{were made in the}} Gottigen <b>low-pressure</b> <b>tunnel</b> with the Bruhn double-throat Venturi tube. This type of tunnel makes it possible to vary the pressure and thereby the density within wide limits and consequently, to examine the viscosity effect. This, however, did not impair the results because pressure and temperature were determined at different periods...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnel and in the Langley two-dimensional <b>low-pressure</b> <b>tunnel</b> of 6 - and 10 -percent-thick symmetrical circular-arc airfoil sections at low Mach numbers and several Reynolds numbers. The airfoils were equipped with 0. 15 -chord plain leading-edge flaps and 0. 20 -chord plan trailing-edge flaps. The section lift and pitching-moment characteristics were determined for both airfoils with the flaps deflected individually and in combination. The section drag characteristics were obtained for the 6 -percent-thick airfoil with the flaps partly deflected as low-drag-control flaps and for airfoils with the flaps neutral. Surface pressures were measured on the 6 -percent-thick airfoil section with the flaps deflected either individually or in appropriate combination to furnish flap load and hinge-moment data applicable to the structural design of the airfoil. A generalized method is developed that permits the determination of the chordwise pressure distribution over sharp-edge airfoils with plain leading-edge flaps and plain trailing-edge flaps of arbitrary size and deflection...|$|E
5000|$|... ==Liquidation {{of initial}} concept== It went into {{liquidation}} in November 2009 {{because of a}} lack of support. Based on high-speed maglev trains travelling in <b>low-pressure</b> <b>tunnels</b> (approximately 100 millibar) the speeds would have been about 500 kilometres per hour.|$|R
40|$|Results of <b>low-pressure</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> {{testing and}} {{theoretical}} considerations {{are used to}} estimate the eolian transport of surface material on Mars. Saltation on Mars, equations of particle motion, computational results, and analytical determination of surface material movement are considered. A semiempirical formula is developed for estimating {{the total amount of}} surface material moving in eolian saltation, surface traction, and suspension. Numerical solutions of the equations of motion for particle trajectories on the surface of Mars are presented. The ratio of final particle speed to the particle threshold friction speed is found to be several times that of saltation on eart...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} leading-edge {{specimens}} of ATJ graphite and 0. 5 -percent titanium-molybdenum alloy {{were tested in}} a 6 -inch subsonic <b>low-pressure</b> arc-powered <b>tunnel</b> and a 1, 500 -kw subsonic arc jet to determine the effectiveness of several refractory coatings in preventing the oxidation of these materials. The {{results indicate that the}} siliconized coating for the ATJ graphite and the W- 2 and Durak MG coatings for the titanium-molybdenum alloy provide adequate protection at temperatures up to 3, 000 F for the durations of the tests in these facilities, approximately 70 seconds in the arc tunnel and approximately 10 minutes in the arc jet. Weight losses (less than one-half of 1 percent) experienced by a few of the coated specimens indicate that tests of longer duration in these environments may prove deleterious and that the stability of these coatings may be depreciated under the low-pressure environmental conditions encountered during reentry...|$|R
