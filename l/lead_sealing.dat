5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of <b>lead</b> <b>sealing</b> from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|E
40|$|Lead-free {{glasses with}} a low melting point and good {{chemical}} durability are desirable for the sealing process in the ceramic and electronic fields. In this study, V_ 2 O_ 5, ZnO, BaO, TeO_ 2, P_ 2 O_ 5 were chosen for development of low melting lead-free sealing glasses. The glass forming region, glasss transition temperature, softening temperature, thermal stability, thermal expansion property, and X-ray properties were investigated in detail in the ternary (V_ 2 O_ 5 -ZnO-BaO) and quaternary (V_ 2 O_ 5 -ZnO-BaO-TeO_ 2 or P_ 2 O_ 5) systems. It was exhibited that the lead-free glasses had good sealing property in some tests with a flat fluorescence lamp. Hence, the sealing properties of these lead-free glasses were showed an excellent performance {{as a substitute for}} the commercial <b>lead</b> <b>sealing</b> glass. ...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} seriously {{threatens the}} security and {{the stability of the}} dry-type air-core reactor operation. In this paper, concerning its extreme high voltage and strong magnetic field environment, the temperature monitoring for the 35 kV dry-type air-core reactor under the working condition using embedded (fiber Bragg grating) FBG is implemented. An optical FBG temperature sensor with the characteristics of simple structure, small volume, and electromagnetic interference resistance is developed. The sensor is then buried in the <b>lead</b> <b>sealing</b> surface casing between two adjacent ventilation bars. The distance {{to the top of the}} reactor is about 40 cm. The temperature experimental results show that, after reaching steady state, the temperature of the inner conductor layer and the outer conductor layer are relatively low, about 82 ℃ and 72 ℃ respectively, and the temperatures in the middle are distributed between 90 ℃ and 100 ℃. The highest temperature of the conductor layer 6 is about 100 ℃. The designed embedded optical FBG temperature sensor is stable and reliable, with high precision and electromagnetic interference resistance. It can realize the on-line temperature monitoring in the extreme environment for 35 kV dry-type air-core reactors, and is vital to maintain {{the security and}} stability of the power grid. ©, 2015, Chinese Machine Press.

50|$|A 3-way socket {{has three}} {{electrical}} contacts. In {{addition to the}} two contacts of the standard socket, a third contact is added. This contact is positioned off-center {{in the bottom of}} the socket (contact two in photo). This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb. A problem of these devices is that the ring contact of the socket (contact two in photo) digs into the <b>lead</b> <b>seal</b> on the lamp bulb's contact ring and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, popping noises, and loss of power to the low wattage filament as the <b>lead</b> <b>seal</b> on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.|$|R

In the case of Russian icons, it is possible to discriminate between an Au-Ag bilayer and an alloy of these metals in the gilds. However, when applied to <b>lead</b> <b>seals</b> RBS with protons encounters a significant limitation due to some deficiency in the available computer programs used for spectrum processing.

5000|$|According to tradition, he was {{the first}} pope to use <b>lead</b> <b>seals</b> (bullae) on papal documents, which in time came to be called [...] "papal bulls". One bulla dating from his reign is still preserved, the obverse of which {{represents}} the Good Shepherd in the midst of His sheep, with the letters Alpha and Omega underneath, while the reverse bears the inscription: Deusdedit Papæ.|$|R
40|$|The article aims at giving {{currency}} in the scholarly circles {{to a new}} Byzantine <b>lead</b> <b>seal</b> found in Pliska in 2016. This lead bulla is 2, 5 mm thick, it has a diameter of 22 mm and is preserved {{in a very good}} condition. The stamp is of good quality but unfortunately, it has not been well centred and because of this part of the impression and the legend have remained outside the lead core (Fig.). However, the seal is in a sufficiently good shape and its impression is clear enough to allow to ascertain with certainty that it is a new parallel copy of an already known <b>lead</b> <b>seal</b> of a Byzantine stratēgos of which eight copies have been found and published so far. Seven of these copies come from Preslav and one has been found in the vicinity of Silistra. It is situated on the obverse of this lead bulla, an image of a blossoming doubly intersected patriarchal cross on a pedestal of two steps, inserted into a double granulated circle. The invocation “Κύριε βοήθει τῷ σῷ δούλῳ”, of which the letters R. ΗΘΙΤωCω have been preserved, is written {{in the form of a}} circle round the image. On the reverse of the <b>lead</b> <b>seal,</b> clearly enough can be seen the first four lines of the five-line written inscription. The complete deciphering of the legend is as follows: “+ Κύριε βοήθει τῷ σῷ δούλῳ Ἰωάννῃ βασιλικῷ πρωτοσπαθαρίῳ καὶ στρατηγῷ Περσκλάβας”, in translation: O, Lord, help your servant John, imperial prōtospatharios and stratēgos of Persklava (i. e.
