40|$|This study {{discusses}} one of Louisa MayAlcott?s novels entitled A Long Fatal Love Chase. This discussion {{talks about}} {{the failure of the}} main female character?s efforts to escape from her <b>miserable</b> <b>life.</b> It is focusing on Rosamond?s efforts and failure to escape from her <b>miserable</b> <b>life.</b> I am interested to talk about her efforts and failure in order to find out the ways Rosamond uses to escape from her <b>miserable</b> <b>life</b> and also the reasons that cause her failure to get out from it. In analyzing the novel, I use the literary theories such as the theory of characterization and the theory of conflict. The theory of characterization is useful to analyze Rosamond as the main female character in the novel while the theory of conflict is useful to analyze the inner and the outer conflicts that she faces. Rosamond?s efforts and failure appear because Rosamond wants to get out from her <b>miserable</b> <b>life</b> caused by her grandfather?s lack of affection and Phillip Tempest?s obsessive love. She does not easily give up to her fate. She does a lot of efforts to make her <b>miserable</b> <b>life</b> end. Besides, she also experiences inner conflicts and outer conflicts during her efforts to escape from her <b>miserable</b> <b>life.</b> She experiences her inner conflict when she has to choose between Phillip and De Luneville, while her outer conflict is when she consistently refuses Phillip?s offer to be his wife. Unfortunately, all her efforts are useless. She experiences failure because she is incapable to escape from Phillip?s obsessive love, but she gets her freedom through her death...|$|R

500|$|From the {{beginning}} of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in OlmÃ¼tz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: [...] "From the moment I crossed {{the threshold of the}} OlmÃ¼tz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God." [...] Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine (13 times) operas to the theatre, including the new Bizet's Carmen, and won over the press that had initially been sceptical to him. After a week's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre's [...] "Musical and Choral Director" [...] from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre's Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and vice-versa) and set out to make his <b>life</b> <b>miserable.</b> Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber's Der FreischÃ¼tz, and 25 other operas. on 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel's play Der Trompeter von SÃ¤ckingen ("The Trumpeter of SÃ¤ckingen"), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ("Songs of a Wayfarer").|$|E
