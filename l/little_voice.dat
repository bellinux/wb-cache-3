5|$|There is very <b>little</b> <b>voice</b> {{acting in}} the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E

He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by Ray Middleton, though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that. [...] Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself <b>little</b> <b>voice</b> towards the end, and would have his understudy go on. Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; George Jean Nathan wrote that [...] "Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a <b>little</b> <b>voice</b> on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E

Jim Farber of New York Daily News commented that [...] "Despite such spicy bits, the core of Britney's concert suffered from the familiarity and cheesiness of all teen road shows these days. The sparklers, explosions and mandatory flying dancers conformed to the corniness of theme park entertainment". [...] The ticket prices were set at $32 in North America.

Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>voice</b> inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer."
