40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{validation}} of two novel traffic signal control approaches for single intersections in the field. The two new methods are explained and the intersections for testing are presented. They {{are located in the}} German cities of Braunschweig, Halle and Berlin and differ in their set-up regarding intersection geometry, existing control strategy and traffic conditions. First simulation results demonstrate that the new methods have the promise to improve the currently on the examined intersections used control strategies by up to 8 %. To apply the new methods in the field the <b>local</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>controllers</b> are adapted with additional detection and controlling equipment, which enables the implementation of the new control methods. The next and final step will be the evaluation of the new control methods to compare the simulation results with the findings from the field tests...|$|R
40|$|An {{intersection}} {{controlled by}} an <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> receives trigger signals from on-coming emergency vehicles responding {{to an emergency}} call. The <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> initiates surveillance of the intersection via cameras installed at the intersection {{in response to a}} received trigger signal. The surveillance may begin immediately upon receipt of the trigger signal from an emergency vehicle, or may wait until the <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> determines that the signaling emergency vehicle is in the field of view of the cameras at the intersection. Portions of the captured images are tagged by the <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> based on tag signals transmitted by the vehicle or based on detected traffic patterns that indicate a potential traffic violation. The captured images are downloaded to a processing facility that analyzes the images and automatically issues citations for captured traffic violations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{adaptive}} {{traffic control}} system was developed where the traffic load is continuously measured by loop detectors {{connected to a}} microcontroller-based system which also performs all intersection control functions. <b>Intersection</b> <b>controllers</b> of an area are interconnected with a communication network through which traffic load and synchronization information is exchanged. As a result, the duration and relative phases of each traffic light cycle change dynamically. The new architecture is completely distributed and {{eliminates the need for}} a central computer to individually control traffic lights. For the basic function of the system only the <b>intersection</b> <b>controllers</b> are required. The connection of the central computer is needed only for system surveillance and for traffic data collection and storage...|$|R

5000|$|A third {{characteristic}} of the SURTRAC design is to manage urban (grid-like) road networks, where there are multiple (typically competing) dominant flows that shift dynamically through the day, and where specific dominant flows cannot be predetermined (as in arterial or major crossroad applications). Urban networks also often have closely spaced intersections requiring tight coordination of the <b>intersection</b> <b>controllers.</b> The combination of competing dominant flows and densely spaced intersections presents a challenge for all adaptive traffic control systems. SURTRAC determines dominant flows dynamically by continually communicating projected outflows to downstream neighbors. [...] This information gives each <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> a more informed basis for locally balancing competing inflows while simultaneously promoting establishment of larger [...] "green corridors" [...] when traffic flow circumstances warrant.|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless data-communication {{and control}} system automatically modifies the switching of traffic lights to {{give priority to}} emergency vehicles. The system, which was reported in several NASA Tech Briefs articles at earlier stages of development, includes a transponder on each emergency vehicle, a monitoring and control unit (an <b>intersection</b> <b>controller)</b> at each <b>intersection</b> equipped with traffic lights, and a central monitoring subsystem. An essential component {{of the system is}} a software module executed by a microcontroller in each transponder. This module integrates and broadcasts data on the position, velocity, acceleration, and emergency status of the vehicle. The position, velocity, and acceleration data are derived partly from the Global Positioning System, partly from deductive reckoning, and partly from a diagnostic computer aboard the vehicle. The software module also monitors similar broadcasts from other vehicles and from <b>intersection</b> <b>controllers,</b> informs the driver of which intersections it controls, and generates visible and audible alerts to inform the driver of any other emergency vehicles that are close enough to create a potential hazard. The execution of the software module can be monitored remotely and the module can be upgraded remotely and, hence, automaticall...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{traffic control}} is an {{important}} issue of the modern transportation system. However, in large-scale urban transportation systems, traditional centralized coordination methods suffer bottlenecks in both communication and computation. Decentralized control is hard if there is very limited observation to the whole network as evidences to support joint traffic coordination decisions. In this paper, we proposed a novel decentralized, multiagent based approach for massive traffic lights coordination to promote the large-scale green transportation. Considering that only the traffic from the adjacent intersections may affect the state of a given intersection one time ahead, the key of our approach is using the observations of a <b>local</b> <b>intersection</b> and its neighbors as evidences to support the traffic light coordination decisions. Therefore, we can model the interactions as decentralized agents coordinating with a decision theoretical model. Within a <b>local</b> <b>intersection,</b> constraint optimizing agents are designed to efficiently search for joint activities of the lights. Since this approach involves only <b>local</b> <b>intersection</b> cooperation, it is well scalable and easily implemented with small communication overhead. In the last section, we present our software design on this approach and based on our simulation, this approach is feasible to a large urban transportation system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of a traffic responsive <b>intersection</b> <b>controller</b> which combines vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) data and inductive loop information, to fixed-time, inductive loop, and GPS based controllers. The INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard reports that vehicles spent up to 42 % of their travel time in congested traffic in 2016. Inefficient signal timing choices by isolated <b>intersection</b> <b>controllers</b> contribute to traffic delays, causing severe negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved using vehicles’ GPS information combined with vehicle flow information from inductive loops to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This proposed new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as optimised traffic flow can reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The proposed traffic responsive Hybrid Vehicle Actuation (HVA) algorithm uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection to actuate intersection signal timings. When vehicle broadcast data are unavailable, HVA uses inductive loop data. Microscopic simulations comparing HVA to fixed-time control, inductive Loop Based Vehicle Actuation (Loop-VA) and GPS Based Vehicle Actuation (GPS-VA) on four urban road networks were carried out to see how the proposed HVA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies. The results show that HVA is an effective alternative to traditional intersection control strategies, offering delay reductions of up to 32 % over Loop-VA, for networks with 0 − 100 % connected vehicle presence...|$|R
