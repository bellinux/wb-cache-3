5|$|For eight years, {{she worked}} in {{publishing}} at Quarto and Gordon Fraser. She spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in Turin, Italy and Bilbao, Spain. She returned to England in 1992 and {{spent the rest of}} that year in County Durham, in a house that <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the North Sea. There she began working on her first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.|$|E
25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, {{her most}} vivid {{childhood}} memories were not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} spent every summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why she felt so connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{freshman}} year of college in 2007, when Yom Kippur (the holiest {{day of the year}} in Judaism; a fast day that is the [...] "Day of Atonement") fell on a Saturday, he fasted until an hour before the Big Ten Conference opener against Iowa started that night. Carimi said, [...] "Religion is a part of me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. I actually do make sacrifices that I know are hard choices.” [...] At the 2011 NFL combine, when asked whether he would play on Yom Kippur in the NFL, he responded: [...] "I already <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the next 15 years, and Yom Kippur doesn't fall on a Sunday." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the design}} and its execution, Shibe hired William Steele and Sons. Their {{engineering}} staff had worked with the new technology of steel-reinforced concrete, and designed and built the city's first skyscraper, the Witherspoon Building at Walnut and Juniper Streets. The Steele design for the Shibe façade was in the ornate French Renaissance style, including arches, vaultings, and Ionic pilasters. The grandstand walls were to be of red brick and terra cotta and featured elaborate decorative friezes with baseball motifs, while cartouches framed the Athletics' [...] "A" [...] logo at regular intervals above the entrances. The souvenir program on Opening Day called it [...] "a fetching combination of color." [...] Gabled dormer windows on the upper deck's copper-trimmed green-slate mansard roof <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the streets below. Presiding over all were terra cotta busts of Shibe and Mack above the main entrances on Lehigh and 21st.|$|E

2500|$|Fort Santa Barbára (Spanish: Fuerte de Santa Barbára) {{stood at}} {{the eastern end of}} the line. Its {{pentagonal}} structure was aimed like an arrowhead south at Gibraltar and supported 24 gun positions, with a bastion trace in the gorge, a dry ditch, a covered way and a glacis. The two eastern sides of the fort <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> the Mediterranean Sea, while the south-facing side enfiladed part of the eastern side of Gibraltar and the isthmus. James recorded that its rampart was [...] "thirty feet broad, and mounted with twelve iron fifteen pounders, and one thirteen inch brass mortar." [...] It had a considerably stronger rear than San Felipe as the rampart was continued at the same thickness around the entire circumference of the fort. There were four large bombproof casemates under the ramparts and, as at San Felipe, a sea wall held back the waves. The peacetime garrison of the fort was the same as at San Felipe, with one captain, one subaltern and fifty men.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>over</b> his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
