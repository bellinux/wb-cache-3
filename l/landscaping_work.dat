5|$|The fourth marquess, John Crichton-Stuart, was an {{enthusiastic}} restorer and builder and commissioned a major restoration project between 1928 and 1939. The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, {{along with several}} of the other towers. The marquess carried out <b>landscaping</b> <b>work,</b> {{with the intent of}} eventually re-flooding the lakes, and thanks to several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching on the view of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The Pyper family's {{control of}} the constableship {{concluded}} in 1754, and George II then appointed a sequence of constables who became responsible for running the castle and county gaol {{on behalf of the}} duchy of Cornwall. In 1764, the north gatehouse was partially demolished by Coryndon Carpenter, a former mayor of Launceston and the castle's constable, who used the materials to help built a new mansion alongside the castle, called Eagle House. Parts of the north-west curtain wall were destroyed in the process of his <b>landscaping</b> <b>work.</b> When the artist William Gilpin visited in 1775, he praised the picturesque condition of the ruins.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, {{designed}} {{under the}} leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles. The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was opened on December 30, 1940, in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and <b>landscaping</b> <b>work</b> continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million per mile, was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 2013, the New York State Department of Transportation {{announced}} that construction had begun on {{the stretch of}} NY110 between the Long Island Expressway (I-495) and the Northern State Parkway. The construction would become a makeover to connect two previously completed reconstruction projects to help the roadway become ADA-accessible, upgrade the sewage systems, resurface the pavement along the alignment along with new traffic light systems and <b>landscaping</b> <b>work.</b> Construction of the new $22.5million project would {{be completed by the}} end of 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} {{exigencies of}} the war left Woodland Cemetery in need of maintenance. [...] While much work on preparing the northern half of the cemetery had been accomplished, little <b>landscaping</b> <b>work</b> had been done between 1864 and 1866, and the wood fence {{on the north side}} was collapsing. The city had added a Deputy Sexton to the cemetery department's staff, and a home for this staff person needed to be built at Woodland. The city council's Committee on Parks and Public Grounds agreed to visit cemetery in June 1866 to ascertain its beautification needs. Their report led the council to authorize in August 1866 a water main to be constructed beneath Main Drive at Woodland.|$|E
2500|$|The late 1960s saw the {{completion}} of the memorial. [...] In February 1966, Senator Everett Dirksen (a Mason) dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floor. The dedication meant that the final room in the tower was now complete and open to the public. [...] In 1967, the city of Alexandria changed the street layout around the memorial. [...] As part of this alteration, the memorial granted the city a [...] wide access path (or [...] "alley") between the memorial's access road and Park Road. [...] Since the back wall of the auditorium had never been faced with granite, the protruding steel reinforcing bars had rusted. [...] These were removed in 1968, as they were no longer fit for use. Finally, in 1970, the 40-year-old oil-burning heating plant was replaced with new natural gas-burning boilers, the city of Alexandria donated a back-up electrical generator to keep the tower lit in case of blackouts, additional lighting for the tower was installed, and additional <b>landscaping</b> <b>work</b> completed.|$|E
2500|$|The new Kermit High School {{building}} and renovations include: [...] total of new space; a practice gym; a new, state-of-the-art competition gym; new, modern classrooms; renovations {{to the existing}} auditorium and band hall; and lastly, {{the construction of a}} fine arts center was {{to be added to the}} existing band hall and auditorium and these final additions would remain separate from the rest of the new high school building. The existing school building, except the existing auditorium and band hall, was to be demolished during the summer of 2011 but the demolition was postponed indefinitely after the Kermit ISD Board of Trustees decided that there was not enough funding left in the bond to demolish the building. After the demolition of the old school building, the construction of new parking lots, additions to the existing band hall and auditorium, and <b>landscaping</b> <b>work</b> are to be completed. Classes began in the new school building in the fall of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1932, {{the budget}} {{submitted}} by Roosevelt would start moving money towards fast tracking construction of parkways on Long Island, as the Westchester parkway system {{was in full}} force. $1.08million was appropriated for the Northern State Parkway construction along with $92,000 for <b>landscaping</b> <b>work</b> out of the $9.5million requested for Long Island in total. However, in February, the state legislature cut down {{the amount of money}} on the budget that Roosevelt had submitted. Instead of the $1.08million, which was cut from the budget, $200,000 was instead given to the Grand Central Parkway. Roosevelt slammed the decision by the Republican leaders in the Legislature as a [...] "cleverly disguised salary reduction program." [...] The cuts also included $15,000,000 for parkways and highways, which would break an agreement in 1929 that would go to the construction of facilities for motorists. In response, Moses and the LISPC went and applied for federal grants on July 18 to pay for the Northern State, along with other projects slashed in the budget. $1million was requested to pave both the Grand Central and Northern State.|$|E
