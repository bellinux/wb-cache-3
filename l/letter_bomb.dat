5|$|The British {{camp was}} {{targeted}} for {{attack by the}} Irgun on two occasions. On 27 June 1939, the paramilitary group placed a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> in the mailbox attached to the outside wall; the subsequent explosion collapsed part of the wall and injured five Arabs in the vicinity. On 12 March 1947, the Irgun penetrated the camp itself in a pre-dawn operation and detonated explosives {{in one of the}} buildings to protest the imposition of martial law on Jerusalem. One British soldier was killed and eight injured in the blasts; martial law was lifted four days later.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the bombing, Shaw was {{appointed}} High Commissioner of Trinidad and Tobago. The Irgun immediately sent a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> to him there, but it was intercepted and successfully disarmed.|$|E

500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the <b>letter</b> <b>bomb,</b> was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first <b>letter</b> <b>bomb,</b> Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E

500|$|As the ALP {{began the}} 1975 campaign, {{it seemed that}} its {{supporters}} would maintain their rage. Early rallies drew huge crowds, with attendees handing Whitlam money to pay election expenses. The crowds greatly exceeded those in any of Whitlam's earlier campaigns; in Sydney, 30,000partisans gathered for an ALP rally in The Domain below a banner: [...] "Shame Fraser Shame". Fraser's appearances drew protests, and a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> sent to Kerr was defused by authorities. Instead of making a policy speech to keynote his campaign, Whitlam made a speech attacking his opponents and calling 11 November [...] "a day which will live in infamy".|$|E
500|$|Linguet's {{work was}} {{followed}} by another prominent autobiography, Henri Latude's Le despotisme dévoilé. Latude was a soldier who was imprisoned in the Bastille following a sequence of complex misadventures, including the sending of a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> to Madame de Pompadour, the King's mistress. Latude became famous for managing {{to escape from the}} Bastille by means of climbing up the chimney of his cell and then descending the walls with a home-made rope ladder, before being recaptured afterwards in Amsterdam by French agents. Latude was released in 1777, but was rearrested following his publication of a book entitled Memoirs of Vengeance. Pamphlets and magazines publicised Latude's case until he was finally released again in 1784. Latude became a popular figure with the [...] "Académie française", or French Academy, and his autobiography, although inaccurate in places, did much to reinforce the public perception of the Bastille as a despotic institution.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While she was {{walking away from the}} reporters, Julie Kaufman began to ask Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground. Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, after the completion of the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E

50|$|In Cairo, Lotz {{eventually}} {{opened his}} riding club {{and continued to}} befriend the elite of Egyptian society. He managed to persuade them to show him the Egyptian missile launch sites and he gathered intelligence on the Egyptian military and its industries. He also composed a list of German scientists {{who worked for the}} Egyptians and in September 1964 he sent <b>letter</b> <b>bombs</b> to some of them, in an attempt to induce them to cease their work. Lotz's terror <b>letter</b> <b>bombs</b> killed some Egyptian civilians and their effects were deemed limited.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a series}} of seven <b>letter</b> <b>bombs</b> were sent during January and February 2007 to various {{companies}} and agencies, all related {{in some way to}} DNA testing and road transport. Police said that some of the letters were hand written and some typed. All seven <b>letter</b> <b>bombs</b> were sent in A5 Jiffy-style envelopes. On 19 February 2007, Miles Cooper was arrested and (on 23 February) appeared in court charged with 12 offences relating to the case. On 27 September, he was found guilty of all 12 charges.|$|R

2500|$|In February 1914, {{authorities}} {{in several countries}} identified Cătărău and Kiriloff as responsible for another attack, the <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> which exploded at the Hajdúdorog Bishopric palace, in Debrecen. The selection of this target was later explained in ethnic terms, since the Bishopric served to Magyarize the population of Partium. The standard account is that Cătărău had personally traveled to Bukovina's main city, Czernowitz, and sent the bomb across Austria-Hungary.|$|E

50|$|Similar to the Mossad letter-bomb campaign, {{dozens of}} <b>letter</b> <b>bombs</b> were sent from Amsterdam to Israeli {{diplomatic}} posts {{around the world}} in September and October 1972. One such attack killed Ami Shachori, an Israeli Agricultural Counselor in Britain.|$|R
2500|$|During IBB's tenure, {{corruption}} {{became a}} policy of state. Vehicles and cash gifts were routinely disbursed [...] to earn loyalty, and the discipline of the military force eroded. The term [...] "IBB Boys" [...] emerged, meaning fronts for {{the head of state}} in business realm, someone who will transact dirty deals from drug dealing to money laundering. The President was reportedly deeply involved in drug dealing through the first lady, Maryam Babangida, and Gloria Okon (his girlfriend). The near-revelation of that fact by Dele Giwa triggered the assassination of the journalist by the Presidential death squad using a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the wounded}} was a child whose {{injuries}} had been so severe that a rescue worker at the scene assumed the child had been killed. One young woman lost both legs; she was photographed by Derek Brind of the Associated Press as a British Paratrooper held her in his arms. Passerby Frank Heagan witnessed the explosion and came upon {{what was left of}} two binmen who had been [...] "blown to pieces". He added that [...] "there was blood everywhere and people moaning and screaming. The street was full of girls and women all wandering around". The injured could be heard screaming as the ambulances transported them to hospital; emergency amputations were performed at the scene. One policeman angrily denounced the attack by stating: [...] "This was a deliberate attempt to kill innocent people. The people who planted it must have known that people were being evacuated into its path". Whilst the security forces and firemen pulled victims from the debris in Donegall Street, two more bombs went off elsewhere in the city centre; however, nobody was hurt in either attack. That same day in Derry, a British soldier, John Taylor, was shot dead by an IRA sniper. In Dublin, the IRA's Chief of Staff, Seán Mac Stíofáin, suffered burns to his face and hands after he had opened a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> sent to him through the post. Cathal Goulding, head of the Official IRA, also received a <b>letter</b> <b>bomb</b> but escaped injury by having dismantled the device before it exploded.|$|E
