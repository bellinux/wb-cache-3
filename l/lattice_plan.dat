In this work, we report the preparation of Ag 2 S thin films from a new precursor using chemical spray pyrolysis technique. The thin films having various [CS(NH 2) 2]/[AgCl] were grown at different substrate temperatures and characterized using X-Ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, transmission T(λ) and reflectivity R(λ) measurements.

40|$|Abstract — Trajectory {{generation}} {{and control of}} large equipment in open field environments involves systematically and robustly operating in uncertain and dynamic terrain. This paper presents an integrated motion planning and control system for tracked vehicles. Flexible path-end adjustments and adaptive look-ahead are introduced to a state <b>lattice</b> <b>planning</b> approach with waypoint control. For a given processing horizon, this increases search coverage and reduces planning error. This tramming approach has been successfully fielded on a 98 -ton autonomous blast hole drill rig used in iron ore mining in Western Australia.

In this approach, {{the view of}} planning as theorem proving is retained, although {{the emphasis is on}} proving theorems about dominance relations on classes of candidate plans.

40|$|Summary. We {{propose a}} principled method {{to create a}} search space for {{constrained}} motion planning, which efficiently encodes only feasible motion plans. The space of possible paths is encoded implicitly in the connections between states, but only feasible and only local connections are allowed. Furthermore, we propose a systematic method to generate a near-minimal set of spatially distinct motion alternatives. This set of motion primitives preserves the connectivity of the representation while eliminating redundancy – leading to a very efficient structure for motion planning at the chosen resolution.

40|$|Robots {{have become}} {{increasingly}} adept at performing {{a wide variety of}} tasks in the world. However, many of these tasks can benefit tremendously from having more than a single robot simultaneously working on the problem. Multiple robots can aid in a search and rescue mission each scouting a subsection of the entire area in order to cover it quicker than a single robot can. Alternatively, robots with different abilities can collaborate in order to achieve goals that individually would be more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In these cases, multi-robot collaboration can provide benefits in terms of shortening search times, providing a larger mix of sensing, computing, and manipulation capabilities, or providing redundancy to the system for communications or mission accomplishment. One principle drawback of multi-robot systems is how to efficiently and effectively generate plans that use each of the team members to their fullest extent, particularly with a heterogeneous mix of capabilities. Towards this goal, I have developed a series of planning algorithms that incorporate this collaboration into the planning process. Starting with systems that use collaboration in an exploration task I show teams of homogeneous ground robots planning to efficiently explore an initially unknown space. These robots share map information and in a centralized fashion determine the best goal location for each taking into account the information gained by other robots as they move. This work is followed up with a similar exploration scheme but this time expanded to a heterogeneous air-ground robot team operating in a full 3 -dimensional environment. The extra dimension adds the requirement for the robots to reason about what portions of the environment they can sense during the planning process. With an air-ground team, there are portions of the environment that can only be sensed by one of the two robots and that information informs the algorithm during the planning process. Finally, I extend the air-ground robot team to moving beyond merely collaboratively constructing the map to actually using the other robots to provide pose information for the sensor and computationally limited team members. By explicitly reasoning about when and where the robots must collaborate during the planning process, this approach can generate trajectories that are not feasible to execute if planning occurred on an individual robot basis. An additional contribution of this thesis is the development of the State <b>Lattice</b> <b>Planning</b> with Controller-based Motion Primitives (SLC) framework. While SLC was developed to support the collaborative localization of multiple robots, it can also be used by a single robot to provide a more robust means of planning. For example, using the SLC algorithm to plan using a combination of vision-based and metric-based motion primitives allows a robot to traverse a GPS-denied region...|$|R
40|$|A higher-order {{single-layer}} relaxation-type recurrent {{neural network}} is employed {{to plan a}} task in a decomposed state space.

A fourth-order stochastic optimization neural network, single-layer relaxationtype recurrent network with simulated annealing, is utilized to perform the search needed to specify the transfer sequence in the state space of the complex task.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a state <b>lattice</b> motion <b>planning</b> algorithm depends critically on {{the resolution of the}} lattice to ensure a balance between solution quality and computation time. There is currently no theoretical basis for selecting the resolution because of its dependence on the robot dynamics and the distribution of obstacles. In this paper, we examine the problem of motion planning on a resolution constrained lattice for a robot with non-linear dynamics operating in an environment with randomly generated disc shaped obstacles sampled from a homogeneous Poisson process. We present a unified framework for computing explicit solutions to two problems - i) the critical planning resolution which guarantees the existence of an infinite collision free trajectory in the search graph ii) the critical speed limit which guarantees infinite collision free motion. In contrast to techniques used by karaman 2012 high, we use a novel approach that maps the problem to parameters of directed asymmetric hexagonal lattice bond percolation. Since standard percolation theory offers no results for this lattice, we map the lattice to an infinite absorbing Markov chain and use results pertaining to its survival to obtain bounds on the parameters. As a result, we are able to derive theoretical expressions that relate the non-linear dynamics of a robot, the resolution of the search graph and the density of the Poisson process. We validate the theoretical bounds using Monte-Carlo simulations for single integrator and curvature constrained systems and are able to validate the previous results presented by Karaman and Frazolli independently using the novel connections introduced in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a state <b>lattice</b> based motion <b>planning</b> approach, {{which we have}} successfully applied to large, cluttered, but quasi-static environments. Our approach produces smooth and complex maneuvers {{through the use of}} a multi-resolution state lattice, where the resolution is adapted based on the environment, and distance from the robot. We also describe a framework for detecting dynamic obstacles such as pedestrians and cars using a multisensor lasercamera detection and tracking method. Image detection is based on several extensions to the Implicit Shape Model technique; laser detection is instead achieved {{through the use of a}} Conditional Random Fields reasoning. Objects are tracked through the use of multiple motion model Kalman filters in order to cope with several different motion dynamics. Urban environments, are complex, cluttered, and dynamic scenes, however. We therefore propose to extend our dynamic obstacle detection and tracking method with a short-term motion prediction functionality based on the same models used for tracking, effectively generating time based cost or risk maps. We further propose to implement these cost maps into our high-dimensional (5 D to 6 D) lattice planner to generate time-optimal trajectories in dynamic, cluttered environments. A D* implementation is envisioned to speed up re-planning dramatically...|$|R

Molybdenum-99 in the form of molybdate [...] is adsorbed onto acid alumina (...) in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium-99m generator ("technetium cow", also occasionally called a [...] "molybdenum cow"). Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 67 hours, so short-lived technetium-99m (half-life: 6 hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The soluble pertechnetate [...] can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution. A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium-235, which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials.Almost two-thirds of the world's supply comes from two reactors; the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada, and the High Flux Reactor at Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group in Petten, Netherlands.

40|$|During the 1980 s lattice wings {{have been}} {{introduced}} in the Soviet Union in air-to-air {{as well as in}} ground-to-ground missile configurations. Lattice wings represent alternative means for keeping aerodynamic control and stability of highly manoeurable supersonic and hypersonic configurations, replacing or complementing planar fins. A lattice wing consists of an outer frame with an internal grid framework, as schematically shown along with the main geometric parametres in Fig. 1. Recently, such configurations have been studied experimentally in wind tunnel testing in the DLR [5], [6]; additional experiments on isolated <b>lattice</b> wings are <b>planned.</b> On the other hand the numerical prediction of the lattice wing behaviour is decisive for the aerodynamic design process, in order to achieve short development times. In the present report a method is developed to effectively perform numerical simulations of configurations including lattice wings using the DLR Euler and Navier-Stokes solver FLOWer [1]. Since the computation of isolated lattice wings is a time consuming process even on a supercomputer, certain simplifications are necessary. One possibility is to represent the lattice wing by an actuator disk. Respective new boundary conditions have been added to FLOWer for both the inflow and outflow boundaries. When passing the actuator disk, the momentum of the fluid is changed due to the impact of the lattice wing. Dependent on the local velocity vector, this impact is interpolated from a data base and is accounted for in the flux balance. The procedure allows to approximately determine the resulting forces and moments caused by the lattice wing as well as interference effects with the fuselage in nonuniform flow. The data base is obtained from wind tunnel testings using isolated grid fins. The data base may further be used to verify the extended code by comparison with qualified numerical solutions for isolated lattice wings. The implementation of the lattice wing boundary conditions consists of two major blocks. First, the required input-data and data from the data base are read in, the latter stored in corresponding arrays. The second block embodies the inflow and outflow boundary conditions for the actuator disk including the necessary data exchange procedures and the interpolation routines for the data base. In this report, the relevant lattice wing parametres are figured out and a method is presented to store the necessary experimental data in a database, which is readable to FLOWer. The theory for the lattice wing actuator disk is given and operativeness is shown for isolated wings...|$|R
