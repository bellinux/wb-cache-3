Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E

2500|$|The lordship {{attributes}} {{associated with}} the Kyrios image of Jesus also implied his power over all creation.

Over time, based {{on the influence of}} Anselm of Canterbury, Bernard of Clairvaux and others, the Kyrios image of Jesus began to be supplemented with a more [...] "tender image of Jesus", and the Franciscan approach to popular piety was instrumental in establishing this image.|$|E

He crossed the line in Avila Beach solo, registering his first victory of the year. The large group of escapees he was part of came in 6 seconds later, and the whole peloton a minute and seven seconds in arrears. The general classification was reshuffled, with Van Garderen taking the lead from Acevedo and Michael Rogers going from fifth to second. 41-year-old veteran Voigt said in his typical good humored fashion when interviewed after his victory: [...] "I just did the same move I've been doing since the ice age, and I couldn't believe they let me go. Once I get 20 seconds, I'm gone. I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I can't believe they're giving me 20 seconds, don't they know?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the long}} fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah), the angel {{replied that he}} would grant Lot this favor too, and spare that town. The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do {{anything}} until he arrived there, and thus the town {{came to be called}} Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> she turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.
