25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of <b>levorphanol,</b> both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{morphine}} can be countered with opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone; {{the development of}} tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by NMDA antagonists such as ketamine or dextromethorphan. The rotation of morphine with chemically dissimilar opioids in the long-term treatment of pain will slow down the growth of tolerance in the longer run, particularly agents known to have significantly incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine such as <b>levorphanol,</b> ketobemidone, piritramide, and methadone and its derivatives; all of these drugs also have NMDA antagonist properties. It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine is either methadone or dextromoramide.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levorphanol</b> acts {{predominantly}} as an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), {{but is also}} an agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and the nociceptin receptor (NOP), {{as well as an}} NMDA receptor antagonist and a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). <b>Levorphanol,</b> {{similarly to}} certain other opioids, also acts as a glycine receptor antagonist and GABA receptor antagonist at very high concentrations. <b>Levorphanol</b> is 6 to 8 times as potent as morphine at the MOR.|$|E

50|$|Levomethorphan is a prodrug to <b>levorphanol,</b> analogously to DXM {{acting as}} a prodrug to {{dextrorphan}} or codeine behaving as a prodrug to morphine. As such, levomethorphan has similar effects to <b>levorphanol</b> but is less potent as it must be demethylated to the active form by liver enzymes before being able to produce its effects. As a prodrug of <b>levorphanol,</b> levomethorphan functions as a potent agonist of {{all three of the}} opioid receptors, μ, κ (κ1 and κ3 but notably not κ2), and δ, as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Via activation of the KOR, levomethorphan can produce dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects such as dissociation and hallucinations.|$|E
50|$|Relative to morphine, <b>levorphanol</b> lacks {{complete}} cross-tolerance and possesses greater intrinsic {{activity at}} the MOR. The duration of action is generally long compared to other comparable analgesics and varies from 4 hours {{to as much as}} 15 hours. For this reason <b>levorphanol</b> is useful in palliation of chronic pain and similar conditions. <b>Levorphanol</b> has an oral to parenteral effectiveness ratio of 2:1, one of the most favorable of the strong narcotics. Its antagonism of the NMDA receptor, {{similar to those of the}} phenylheptylamine open-chain opioids such as methadone or the phenylpiperidine ketobemidone, make <b>levorphanol</b> useful for types of pain that other analgesics may not be as effective against, such as neuropathic pain. Levorphanol's exceptionally high analgesic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain is also conferred by its action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, similar to the opioids tramadol and tapentadol, and mutually complements the analgesic effect of its NMDA receptor antagonism.|$|E
50|$|Phenomorphan is {{a highly}} potent drug due to the N-phenethyl group, which boosts {{affinity}} to the μ-opioid receptor, and so phenomorphan is around 10x more potent than <b>levorphanol,</b> which is itself 6-8x the potency of morphine. Other analogues where the N-(2-phenylethyl) group {{has been replaced by}} other aromatic rings. are even more potent, with the N-(2-(2-furyl)ethyl) and the N-(2-(2-thienyl)ethyl) analogues being 60x and 45x stronger than <b>levorphanol,</b> respectively.|$|E

50|$|An equianalgesic chart can be {{a useful}} tool, but the user must take care to correct for all {{relevant}} variables such as route of administration, cross tolerance, half-life and the bioavailability of a drug. For example, the narcotic <b>levorphanol</b> is 4-8 times stronger than morphine, but also has a much longer half-life. Simply switching the patient from 40 mg of morphine to 10 mg of <b>levorphanol</b> would be dangerous due to dose accumulation, and hence frequency of administration should also be taken into account.|$|E
5000|$|Chemically, <b>levorphanol</b> {{belongs to}} the morphinan class and is (−)-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan.It is the [...] "left-handed" [...] (levorotatory) {{stereoisomer}} of racemorphan, that is the racemic mixture of the two stereoisomers with differing pharmacology. The [...] "right-handed" [...] (dextrorotatory) enantiomer of racemorphan is dextrorphan (DXO), an antitussive, potent dissociative hallucinogen (NMDA receptor antagonist), and weakly active opioid. DXO is an active metabolite of the pharmaceutical drug dextromethorphan (DXM), which, analogously to DXO, is an enantiomer of the racemic mixture racemethorphan along with levomethorphan, the latter of which has similar properties to those of <b>levorphanol.</b>|$|E

50|$|Morphine {{and most}} of its {{derivatives}} do not exhibit optical isomerism, although some more distant relatives like the morphinan series (<b>levorphanol,</b> dextorphan and the racemic parent chemical dromoran) do, and as noted above stereoselectivity in vivo is an important issue.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-HM's {{levorotatory}} stereoisomer, norlevorphanol, {{in contrast}} to (+)-3-HM, is an opioid analgesic.

50|$|<b>Levorphanol</b> shows a {{high rate}} of psychotomimetic side effects such as {{hallucinations}} and delirium, which have been attributed to by its binding to and activation of the KOR. At the same time however, activation of this receptor {{as well as of the}} DOR have been determined to contribute to its analgesic effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levorphanol,</b> {{brand name}} Levo-Dromoran, is an opioid {{medication}} {{used to treat}} moderate to severe pain. It {{is one of two}} enantiomers of the compound racemorphan, and was first described in Germany in 1948 as an orally active, morphine-like analgesic. The drug has been in clinical use in the United States since 1953.|$|E
50|$|Dextrorphan (DXO) is a {{psychoactive drug}} of the morphinan {{chemical}} class which {{acts as an}} antitussive or cough suppressant and dissociative hallucinogen. It is the dextrorotatory-stereoisomer of racemorphan, the levo-half being <b>levorphanol.</b> Dextrorphan is produced by O-demethylation of dextromethorphan by CYP2D6. Dextrorphan is an NMDA antagonist and contributes to the psychoactive effects of dextromethorphan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levorphanol</b> {{is listed}} under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961 and is {{regulated}} like morphine in most countries. In the U.S., it is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9220 and 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 4.5 kilos. The salts in use are the tartrate (free base conversion ratio 0.58) and hydrobromide (0.76).|$|E
5000|$|It {{shares with}} other opioids {{the risk of}} {{overdose}} or (potentially life-threatening) respiratory depression. When strong narcotics are required, and morphine and diamorphine are not an option, it is more common to use better known drugs such as nicomorphine, hydromorphone, <b>levorphanol,</b> oxymorphone or fentanyl which doctors will be more familiar with, and which do not share the stigma associated with either heroin or morphine.|$|E

50|$|Butorphanol (BC 2627) is a morphinan-type {{synthetic}} agonist-antagonist {{opioid analgesic}} developed by Bristol-Myers. Brand name Stadol was recently discontinued by the manufacturer. It is now only available in its generic formulations, manufactured by Novex, Mylan, Apotex and Ben Venue Laboratories. Butorphanol is most closely structurally related to <b>levorphanol.</b> Butorphanol is available as the tartrate salt in injectable, tablet, and intranasal spray formulations. The tablet form is only used in {{dogs and cats}} due to low bioavailability in humans.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{analgesic}} {{effects are}} only partially reversed by naloxone, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2 adrenergic receptor antagonists like yohimbine and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron. Pharmacologically, tramadol {{is similar to}} <b>levorphanol</b> and tapentadol in that it not only binds to the mu opioid receptor, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its [...] "atypical" [...] opioid activity.|$|E
50|$|Hodgkinsine has antiviral, {{antibacterial}} and antifungal effects, but has mainly been researched for the analgesic {{effects that}} it produces, and {{is thought to}} be one of the components responsible for the analgesic effects seen when Psychotria colorata is used in traditional medical practice in humans. It has been found to act as both a mu opioid agonist and an NMDA antagonist, both of which are mechanisms of action shared with commonly used painkillers (morphine and ketamine respectively, and which occur concurrently in the clinical analgesics tramadol and <b>levorphanol).</b>|$|E
50|$|Similarly to μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) agonists, KOR agonists are potently analgesic, {{and have}} been employed clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain. However, KOR agonists also produce side effects such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation, which has limited their clinical usefulness. Examples of KOR agonists that have been used medically as analgesics include butorphanol, nalbuphine, <b>levorphanol,</b> levallorphan, pentazocine, phenazocine, and eptazocine. Difelikefalin (CR845, FE-202845) and CR665 (FE-200665, JNJ-38488502) are peripherally restricted KOR agonists lacking the CNS side effects of centrally active KOR agonists and are currently under clinical investigation as analgesics.|$|E
50|$|Opioid {{analgesic}} drugs tend {{to exhibit}} incomplete cross-tolerance, {{so that even}} when a patient has developed {{a high level of}} tolerance to one drug from this class, they may find that a different opioid drug will still be effective. The reasons for this are still not completely understood, but are thought to result from variations in opioid receptor affinity and occupancy levels at equianalgesic doses, as well as additional mechanisms of action possessed by some drugs such as the NMDA antagonist action of methadone or <b>levorphanol,</b> or the SNRI activity of tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relative}} analgesic {{potency of}} 11 opioid agents (μ-opioid receptor agonists - fentanyl, <b>levorphanol,</b> methadone, morphine, meperidine and codeine; the partial μ agonist - buprenorphine; and the κ-opioid receptor agonists - nalorphine, bremazocine, U50488 and CI-977) in the Northern grass frog produced a dose-dependent and long-lasting analgesia which persists {{for at least}} 4 hours. The relative analgesic potency of μ-opioids in amphibians was correlated with the relative analgesic potency of these same agents recorded in on the mouse writhing and hot plate tests. [...] Other opioid analgesics are effective in amphibians, for example, butorphanol.|$|E

Sinomenine is a morphinan derivative, related to opioids such as <b>levorphanol</b> and the non-opioid cough suppressant dextromethorphan. Its anti-rheumatic effects are thought to be primarily mediated via release of histamine, but other effects such as inhibition of prostaglandin, leukotriene and nitric oxide synthesis may also be involved.|$|E
50|$|Ro4-1539 (Furethylnorlevorphanol) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug from the morphinan series {{that was developed}} by the pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1950s. It acts as a potent μ-opioid agonist, and was found to be around 30-60x more potent than the related drug <b>levorphanol</b> in animal experiments. While it is notable for its high potency and therapeutic index (1100 in animal studies), being among the more potent μ-agonist found in the morphinan series of drugs (though not on the scale of acetorphine and other morphinans in the extremity of their level of potency), Ro4-1539 had no particular clinical advantages over other available opioid drugs, and was never commercially marketed.|$|E
