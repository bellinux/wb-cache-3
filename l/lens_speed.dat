2500|$|The {{f-number}} [...] of {{an optical}} system {{such as a}} camera lens is {{the ratio of the}} system's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of <b>lens</b> <b>speed,</b> and an important concept in photography. [...] It is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or f-stop. It is the reciprocal of the relative aperture. The f-number is commonly indicated using a hooked f with the format N, where N is the f-number.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{on this is}} {{the reduction}} of light that will reach the film or sensor through the small aperture. Therefore the lenses are usually not suitable for fast-moving objects which require short exposure times - see <b>lens</b> <b>speed.</b> The amount of collected light can be increased by opening the angle of view, which is achieved with an even shorter focal length resulting in a wide-angle lens. Telephoto lenses are not feasible at a reasonable <b>lens</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Candid film photographers {{have been}} forced to use black and white, rather than color film because of its greater film speed. This has given candid photos a {{characteristic}} appearance. Film provides roughly 3 stops more dynamic range compared to earlier digital cameras. However, improved, smaller digital cameras are providing photographers with increased dynamic range, greater <b>lens</b> <b>speeds</b> and sharpness, enabling them to capture high quality candid images.|$|R

5000|$|Attaining maximum <b>lens</b> <b>speed</b> {{requires}} engineering tradeoffs, and as such, [...] "prime" [...] (fixed focal length) lenses {{are generally}} faster than zoom lenses, and modern manual-focus lenses are generally faster than their autofocus counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|A fast <b>lens</b> <b>speed</b> is {{desirable}} in taking pictures in dim light, or with long telephoto lenses and for controlling {{depth of field}} and bokeh, especially in portrait photography, [...] and for sports photography and photojournalism.|$|E

5000|$|AI — Manual focus with [...] "Automatic Maximum-Aperture Indexing," [...] {{introduced}} in 1977. The AI standard adds a Meter Coupling Ridge to the aperture ring, which encodes the current aperture setting {{relative to the}} maximum, and a <b>Lens</b> <b>Speed</b> Indexing Post on the mounting flange, which encodes the maximum aperture itself. The Ridge and Post couple to the camera's light meter. Lenses designated AI-S, Series E, and AF all include these features of AI. Current professional Nikon camera bodies link with the Meter Coupling Ridge, but the <b>Lens</b> <b>Speed</b> Indexing Post is ignored and the maximum aperture value is set electronically by the operator instead. AI-designated lenses also improved on the original Meter Coupling Prong, adding cutaways which allow more ambient light to fall on the aperture ring, increasing visibility on cameras which optically projected the setting inside the viewfinder.|$|E
5000|$|Especially {{outside of}} the [...] "normal lenses", <b>lens</b> <b>speed</b> also tends to {{correlate}} with the price and/or quality of the lens. This is because lenses with larger maximum apertures require greater care with regard to design, precision of manufacture, special coatings and quality of glass. At wide apertures, spherical aberration becomes more significant and must be corrected. Faster telephoto and wide-angle retrofocus designs tend {{to be much more}} expensive.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a solution deposited optical waveguide lens, whose focusing effect is produced by an effective index gradient with a hyperbolic secant variation, is described. The lenses are fabricated by a microcontrolled dip coating procedure from colloidal SiO 2 :TiO 2 solutions. Both the design and construction of the lens, along with the analytical and experimental results of the focusing properties, are described. The best <b>lenses</b> had <b>speeds</b> of ~ƒ/ 10 and focal spots ~ 1. 2 times the diffraction limit at apertures of 2. 0 mm...|$|R
50|$|The {{shutter release}} {{is a small}} lever {{protruding}} from {{the right-hand side of}} the <b>lens.</b> Shutter <b>speeds</b> from 1/30s to 1/500s were available in automatic mode. It also provided a B (bulb) setting, though {{there is no way to}} attach a cable release. Apertures from 2.8 to 22 with constant shutter speed of 1/30 s could be set in manual mode, intended for use with an electronic flash. Flash sync is possible at all shutter speeds through the PC terminal. There is an accessory shoe provided, but it does not sync with flash.|$|R
5000|$|Some lens {{adapters}} {{include a}} special optical element called a telecompressor, focal reducer, or more recently a [...] "speed booster", a genericised trademark {{that refers to}} the Metabones Speed Booster line of lens adapters. This type of adapter is designed to reduce focal length, increase <b>lens</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and in some instances}} improve MTF performance. Another innovator in the field is KIPON, a German/Chinese co-operation between Kipon and IB/E Optics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lens</b> <b>speed</b> {{refers to}} the maximum {{aperture}} diameter, or minimum f-number, of a photographic lens. A lens with a larger maximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a [...] "fast lens" [...] because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster shutter speed. Conversely, a smaller maximum aperture (larger minimum f-number) is [...] "slow" [...] because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{f-number}} of {{an optical}} system {{such as a}} camera lens is {{the ratio of the}} system's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of <b>lens</b> <b>speed,</b> and an important concept in photography. It is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or f-stop.

50|$|Its {{controls}} were transitional between those of mechanical SLRs and future professional film and digital SLRs: the F4's electronics, LCD viewfinder display, autofocus, programmed auto-exposure, and matrix meter {{looked to the}} future, but it also retained classic dedicated analog dials for shutter <b>speed,</b> <b>lens</b> aperture, metering pattern, and exposure compensation.|$|R

Established SLR as viable photojournalist's available-light camera. Had folding waist level finder and focal-plane shutter. Used 4.5×6 cm glass plates or sheet film; {{adaptable}} to roll film.|$|R
50|$|In photography, {{exposure}} {{is the amount}} of light per unit area (the image plane illuminance times the exposure time) reaching a photographic film or electronic image sensor, as determined by shutter <b>speed,</b> <b>lens</b> aperture and scene luminance. Exposure is measured in lux seconds, and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance in a specified region.|$|R
50|$|A telecompressor or focal reducer is {{an optical}} element {{used to reduce}} focal length, {{increase}} <b>lens</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and in some instances}} improve optical transfer function (OTF) performance. Popular applications include photography, videography, and astrophotography. In astrophotography, these qualities are most desirable when taking pictures of nearby large objects, such as nebulae. The effects and uses of the telecompressor are largely opposite to those of the teleconverter or Barlow lens. A combined system of a lens and a focal reducer has smaller back focus than the lens alone; this places restrictions on lenses and cameras that focal reducer might be used with.|$|E
50|$|Due to inch-based sensor formats {{being not}} standardized, their exact {{dimensions}} may vary, but those listed are typical. The listed sensor areas span {{more than a}} factor of 1000 and are proportional to the maximum possible collection of light and image resolution (same <b>lens</b> <b>speed,</b> i.e., minimum F-number), but in practice are not directly proportional to image noise or resolution due to other limitations. See comparisons. Film format sizes are included for comparison. The following comparison is {{with respect to the}} aspect ratio of 4:3. The application examples of phone or camera may not show the exact sensor sizes.|$|E

50|$|The Symmar-S is an {{incremental}} improvement {{to the original}} Symmar design, adding multicoating to the feature set. The lens is not symmetric like its predecessor and is not convertible. The available focal lengths are slightly different, with the subtraction of the 80 mm, and addition of a 120 mm and two 480 mm <b>lenses</b> of varying <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nikkorex Zoom 35 was a {{variation}} on the Nikkorex 35 II. Released in 1963, the Zoom 35 shares the Nikkorex 35 II's distinctive nameplate mounted to a black selenium cell meter. Instead of a 50mm lens, the Nikkorex Zoom 35 has a fixed 43-86mm 3.5 lens that is a predecessor to the Nikkor F-mount 43-86mm lens released later in 1963. Like the earlier fix-lens Nikkorex models, virtually all control of the camera was done using rings on the <b>lens.</b> Shutter <b>speed,</b> aperture, film ASA (ISO) number, zoom and focus each had a control ring on the lens, while only the shutter release and film wind were on the camera body.|$|R

50|$|Nikon {{produced}} a 6 mm circular fisheye lens that was initially designed for {{an expedition to}} Antarctica. It featured a 220-degree field of view, designed to capture the entire sky and surrounding ground when pointed straight up. This lens is no longer manufactured by Nikon, and is used nowadays to produce interactive virtual-reality images such as QuickTime VR and IPIX. Because of its very wide field of view, it is very large and cumbersome—weighing 5.2 kg, having a diameter of 236 mm, a length of 171 mm and an angle of view of 220 degrees. It dwarfs a regular 35 mm SLR camera and has its own tripod mounting point, a feature normally seen in large long-focus or telephoto lenses to reduce strain on the lens mount because the lens is heavier than the camera. The lens is extremely rare, however, there a new developments by the Japanese manufacturer Entaniya for the Micro Four Thirds standard, which offer an angle of view of 250 degrees with lenses that have a focal length of 2.3 mm to 3.6 mm, a <b>lens</b> <b>speed</b> of f/2.8 to f/4.0, a weight of 1.6 kg, a diameter of 120 mm and a length below 100 mm.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} binary optics {{processing}} technology is presented. Pattern replication techniques have been optimized to generate high-quality efficient microoptics in visible and infrared materials. High resolution optical photolithography and precision alignment {{is used to}} fabricate maximally efficient fused silica diffractive microlenses at lambda = 633 nm. The degradation in optical efficiency of four-phase-level fused silica microlenses resulting from an intentional 0. 35 micron translational error has been systematically measured {{as a function of}} <b>lens</b> <b>speed</b> (F/ 2 - F/ 60). Novel processes necessary for high sag refractive IR microoptics arrays, including deep anisotropic Si-etching, planarization of deep topography and multilayer resist techniques, are described. Initial results are presented for monolithic integration of photonic and microoptic systems...|$|E
40|$|The central premise {{within this}} thesis was to further explore Windrum’s (2005) study {{by looking at}} the role that both {{innovation}} strategy and pricing had in the ability of Japanese camera manufacturers to compete in the mature amateur camera industry between 1955 and 1974. In order to explore the influence of innovation, a focus was first placed on the product life cycle, as advocated by Klepper (1997), Vernon(1966; 1979) and Abernathy and Utterback (1975; 1978; 1985) as well as the relationship between innovation and price as advocated by both Chenavaz (2012; 2013) and Porter’s (1980) cost generic strategy. In exploring the key camera components that contribute to the pricing of cameras, findings showed that camera characteristics associated with the camera lens had the most significant impact on the price setting of cameras. In continuation, the paper also establish that the relationship between camera price and innovation (<b>lens</b> <b>speed)</b> is more inelastic in Japan that both the USA and West Germany which therefore insinuates that a correlation is existent between the ability to product low priced products and the ability to compete in a mature industry...|$|E
50|$|They {{are often}} {{considered}} toy cameras {{due to their}} cheap price, bakelite and later thermoplastic construction and low build quality. However, the Lubitels use 120 film, feature Cooke triplet, all-glass <b>lenses</b> and shutter <b>speeds</b> from bulb to 1/250 of a second. Aperture range is from f/4.5 to f/22. These characteristics are closer to those of an amateur TLR of the 1950s than a toy or disposable camera. They can achieve excellent results when the lens is stopped down but, as with any three-element lens, {{the results will be}} soft by today's standards at larger apertures.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} model, the XA, {{was sold}} from 1979 to 1985. The original XA features true rangefinder focusing, a fast 35mm f/2.8 lens, and aperture priority metering. The lens {{was protected by}} a sliding dust cover. Film wind is by thumb-wheel, aperture is set on the body using a small lever, focus is set by a small lever below the <b>lens,</b> film <b>speed</b> (ISO) is set on a dial below the lens, the viewfinder is optical direct-view with the rangefinder frame embedded in it and a display of the shutter speed at the side. Later cameras, models XA2 to XA4, featured scale focusing instead of rangefinders. The XA1 used a fixed-focus lens. Although the cameras resembled each other, there were subtle differences in design. The XA3 and XA4 were slightly larger than the XA and XA2. The original XA's dust cover dome resembled a flattened oval, whereas the other models had a more rounded design.|$|R
