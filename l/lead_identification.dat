40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis is a {{contagious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), affecting {{more than two}} billion people around the globe {{and is one of}} the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Recent reports suggest that Mtb has been developing resistance to the widely used anti-tubercular drugs resulting in the emergence and spread of multi drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains throughout the world. In view of this global epidemic, there is an urgent need to facilitate fast and efficient <b>lead</b> <b>identification</b> methodologies. Target based screening of large compound libraries has been widely used as a fast and efficient approach for <b>lead</b> <b>identification,</b> but is restricted by the knowledge about the target structure. Whole organism screens on the other hand are target-agnostic and have been now widely employed as an alternative for <b>lead</b> <b>identification</b> but they are limited by the time and cost involved in running the screens for large compound libraries. This could be possibly be circumvented by using computational approaches to prioritize molecules for screening programmes. Results We utilized physicochemical properties of compounds to train four supervised classifiers (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, J 48 and SMO) on three publicly available bioassay screens of Mtb inhibitors and validated the robustness of the predictive models using various statistical measures. Conclusions This study is a comprehensive analysis of high-throughput bioassay data for anti-tubercular activity and the application of machine learning approaches to create target-agnostic predictive models for anti-tubercular agents. </p...|$|E
40|$|Now {{that the}} human genome project has been {{completed}} and the human genes have been identified, genome-based drug discovery is starting to play a major role. It involves the process of target and lead identifications; identifying proteins (or drug targets) causing the disease, and identi-fying the lead compounds that would counteract them. We have developed a system for accelerating drug discovery, especially focusing on the <b>lead</b> <b>identification.</b> The system is based on Globus Toolkit 3 /OGSA-DAI and is accessible through the OGSA Grid Data Service. In this system, we have designed meta-databases for integrating information on disease, proteins (drug targets) and ligands (lead com-pounds). Using this system, one could easily screen a large library of compounds for ligands of a given protein, just by specifying the protein sequence. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated by measuring the performance of the <b>lead</b> <b>identification</b> of several target proteins, such as nu-clear receptors. 1...|$|E

40|$|Compound {{selection}} {{methods are}} important in drug discovery especially in <b>lead</b> <b>identification</b> process. Finding the best method in compound selection has become a need to the pharmaceutical industry because of {{the increasing number of}} chemical compound to be screened. One of the best and widely used methods in compound selection is cluster-based selection where the compound datasets are grouped into clusters and representative compounds are selected from each cluster. Non-overlapping methods, such as Wardâ€™s clustering method, have been widely used and it was agreed as the most efficient clustering method in compound selection. However, little focus has been given to overlapping method in compound selection or even in <b>lead</b> <b>identification</b> process. The research focused on the fuzzy c-means clustering where the effectiveness of the clusters produced with regard to compound selection is analyzed and compared with other conventional cluster-based compound selection method. Fuzzy c-means have been chosen because it produces clusters by identifying the cluster centroid and their corresponding degree of membership, therefore the compounds may belong to more than one cluster. The results from fuzzy c-means method are compared to Wardâ€™s clustering method and also to the results from the fuzzification of Wardâ€™s cluster. The analysis shows that fuzzy c-means clustering gives the best result in intermolecular dissimilarity; however it shows poor results of separation of active/inactive structure...|$|E
