5000|$|Starting with [...] "U.S. {{support for}} the Iraqis during the 1980s Iraq-Iran War", the book {{makes the point that}} with the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union and the ending of the Cold War, Americans saved the CIA by giving it a new reason to exist, the new threat posed by the combination of [...] "weapons of mass destruction" [...] and [...] "terror". Taking seriously the declarations of Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, and of his predecessor, Ruhollah Khomeini, that nuclear weapons are against teachings of Islam and hence Iran is not seeking them, Porter explains that the pressure by U.S. to prevent Tehran's development of its civilian nuclear program left them with only the Hobson's choice of working covertly and covering their tracks. According to John Waterbury, [...] "The risk for Israel and the United States, of course, is that they might have to go to war to confront a threat that, Porter alleges, they know does not exist." [...] In addition to explaining why Tehran covered its nuclear activity, the author deals with the issues such as the alleged smuggled <b>Lap</b> <b>Top,</b> Parchin test chamber and the role of Israel in creating the crisis. Unraveling the contradictions between the material in the documents and well-established facts, the author demonstrates that the so-called stolen [...] "mysterious documents" [...] allegedly smuggled out of Iran on a laptop which apparently proves Iran’s covert nuclear program, were [...] "fraudulent".|$|E
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Board President Jeffry Pesek and Superintendent Michael Kuzniewski, Morton High School District 201 has drastically expanded learning opportunities. Morton continues to enhance the many activities that support students’ learning such as Tapestry, Credit Recovery Program, and the Freshmen Mentoring Program.

The district actively supports the Parent Teacher Organization and Parent Teacher Association, which helps with several community events throughout the school year, including coordinating a series of annual anti-bullying events. Parent liaisons at all campuses get parents involved in school and community events and hold monthly principal meetings to receive community feedback. Throughout the year counselors host a series of college nights explaining the college application and financial aid process to parents.District 201 has worked to provide safe and well maintained schools to enhance learning for all students. In 2014, the main school entrances were remodeled to provide control of all individuals entering school grounds. Also in 2014, the Board of Education inaugurated the new Morton Stadium which includes a new field, concession stand, and an 8 lane track, among several facility upgrades. In 2014, District 201 upgraded the Morton West pool room lighting with energy efficient lights and updated the ceiling, windows and paint. The Morton West cafeteria was also renovated and expanded over the summer of 2014. In 2014 the old Morton East pool was finally renovated into an expanded classroom. In 2015, six chemistry labs in Morton East and West will be renovated. Renovations are expected for the culinary arts room as well. The 1:1 program was officially launched in 2014. In 2014 all incoming freshmen were given a Dell <b>lap</b> <b>top</b> device. District 201 will continue roll out the distribution and use of laptops for all incoming freshmen classes.

40|$|According to the ISO 14020 {{standard}} eco-labeling {{of products}} {{is intended to}} guide consumers towards the more environmentally friendly segment of products available on the market. To investigate if this is successful for laptop computers, a life cycle assessment (LCA) model of a generic, up to date laptop was created. The constraints imposed by two different eco-labels for laptops were implemented in the LCA model; the eco-labels {{used for this purpose}} were EPEAT (based in the US) and TCO (based in Sweden). The analysis of the eco-labels criteria revealed that the labels impose few changes on the design of the laptop as describe in the LCA model and that their influence on the life cycle impact was minimal. The labels do promote energy efficiency, but the marked demand for long battery life is a push so strong that the average <b>lap</b> <b>top</b> on the market well fulfills these criteria. It was notable that the <b>lap</b> <b>top</b> power efficiency together with short product life, resulted in that the use phase environmental impacts was less compared to the production phase environmental impacts (partly opposed to some earlier studies, where the electricity consumption during use was a more important driver). To promote better environmental performance the energy efficiency could be improved further; but useful life of lap tops is an increasingly important issue to be addressed. Criteria for eco-labels must be continuously updated to actually guide toward a more environmentally friendly market segment for fast developing products like electronics...|$|E
