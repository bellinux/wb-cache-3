40|$|The correct {{measure and}} {{definition}} of liquidity in finance literature remains an unresolved empirical issue. The main {{objective of the}} present study was to develop, validate and test the <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> index (LMI) developed by Brunnermeier, Krishnamurthy and Gorton (2012) empirically. Building on the work of these prior studies, the study undertook to develop a measure of liquidity that integrates both market liquidity and funding liquidity within a context of asset liability management. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> indices were developed and then tested empirically to validate them by regressing them against the known determinants of liquidity. Furthermore, the study investigated the nexus between liquidity and profitability. The unit of analysis was a panel of 12 South African banks over the period 2005 – 2015. The study developed two liquidity measures – the bank <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> index (BLMI) and the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> index (ALMI) – whose performances were compared to and contrasted with the Basel III liquidity measures and traditional liquidity measures using a generalised method of moments (GMM) model. Overall, the two constructed liquidity indices performed better than other liquidity measures. Significantly, the ALMI provided a better macro-prudential liquidity measure that can be utilised in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, thus presenting a major contribution to the body of knowledge. Unlike the LMI, the BLMI and ALMI can be used to evaluate the liquidity of a given bank under liquidity stress events, which are scaled by theoretically motivated and empirically supported liquidity weights. The constructed BLMI contains information regarding the liquidity risk within the context of asset liability mismatches, and the measure used comprehensive data from bank balance sheets and from financial market measures. The newly developed liquidity measures are based on portfolio management theory as they account for the significance of liquidity spirals. Empirical results show that banks increase their liquidity buffers during times of turmoil as both BLMI and ALMI improved during the period 2007 – 2009. Subsequently, the improvement in economic performance resulted in a rise in ALMI but a decrease in BLMI. We found no evidence to support the theory that banks, which heavily depend on external funding, end up in serious liquidity problems. The findings imply that any policy implemented with the intention of increasing bank capital is good for bank liquidity since the financial fragility–crowding-out hypothesis is outweighed by the risk absorption hypothesis because the relationship between capital and bank liquidity is positive.

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years four crisis episodes {{occurred}} in the Turkish economy in April 1994, February 2001, May 2006 and October 2008.

This paper aims to illustrate the essential determinants of these crises by developing a binary and multivariate logit model which estimates the predictive ability of sixteen economic and financial indicators in a sample that covers the period January 1990 -December 2008.

40|$|The global {{economic}} and financial instability context of the 1990 s also affected the Turkish economy. Actually, the 1980 s in Turkey are characterized by a radical transformation of its economy through significant efforts of liberalization. With an out-looking economy and a liberalized financial system in the early 1990 s, Turkey was presented by international {{organizations such as the}} IMF and the World Bank as an example of successful liberalization process to other developing countries. However, this "remarkable " liberalization process, which was performed without ex ante correction of persistent macroeconomic imbalances, worsened {{economic and financial}} instabilities and caused two severe financial crises that occurred first in April 1994 and then in February 2001. This paper aims to illustrate the essential causes of these crises by developing a binominal and multivariate logit model which estimates the predictive ability of eighteen economic and financial indicators in a sample that covers the period January 1990 -December 2002. In addition, the paper evaluates the out-of-sample forecast performance of the model in a period of January 2003 -December 2008 in which two small-scale currency crises occurred in May 2006 and then in October 2008.

In the LMI each asset and liability has a contract-specific time-varying liquidity sensitivity weight which is driven by contract terms and market prices. Using bank regulatory report and repo transaction data, we construct the LMI for 2870 bank holding companies during 2002 - 2013 and investigate its time-series and cross-sectional patterns. The LMI can be aggregated across firms to measure the aggregate liquidity shortfall in the U. S. banking sector. We find that the aggregate banking sector LMI worsens from around [negative] $ 2 trillion in 2004 to $ 4. 5 trillion in 2008, before reversing back to $ 2 trillion in 2009. In the cross section, we find that banks with more <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> (i) experience more negative stock returns during the crisis, and more positive stock returns pre-crisis, and (ii) experience more negative stock returns on events corresponding to a liquidity run, and more positive stock returns on events corresponding to liquidity provision by the government.

40|$|Almost {{twenty years}} after economists Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny {{published}} their ground-breaking and controversial research examining the relationship between investor protection laws and stock market development, {{our understanding of the}} relationship between law and finance is still in its theoretical infancy. Today, few would argue that strong laws do not help generate credible commitments and thereby promote financial development. Ultimately, however, this observation {{is little more than a}} useful starting point for exploring the complex, dynamic, and structurally interdependent relationship between law and finance within modern financial markets. So where might we turn for further insights into this important relationship? One potentially useful framework is the 'Legal Theory of Finance' (LTF). At the heart of LTF are four interwoven propositions. These propositions emphasize the legal construction of financial markets, their essential hybridity and inherent hierarchy, and the role of the law as not only a mechanism for generating credible commitments, but also as a potential source of financial instability. LTF thus both complements and expands upon conventional frameworks for understanding the relationship between law and finance. This Article uses LTF to explore the emergence, growth, and risks residing within a little known but increasingly important segment of the Chinese shadow banking system: the $USD 2 trillion dollar market for wealth management products (WMPs). WMPs possess a number of distinctive legal and economic features. First, despite being marketed by banks and other intermediaries as substitutes for conventional deposit accounts, the liabilities generated by the majority of these products do not reside on bank balance sheets. Second, while WMPs typically lock-in investors' capital for relatively short periods of time, this capital is often invested into less liquid, longer-term assets. The resulting maturity and <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatches</b> thus recreate the fragile capital structure of banks. Third, WMPs have emerged largely in response to China's interventionist approach toward both banking regulation and broader macroeconomic policy. As we shall see, LTF holds out a number of important insights into the emergence of WMPs, their legal structure, their dramatic growth in the wake of the financial crisis, and the risks they may pose to financial stability. More broadly, understanding WMPs through the lens of LTF highlights the fact that, far from simply representing the 'rules of the game,' the law is also often the board, the game pieces, and the dice...|$|R

The results show that positive liquidity shocks, driven by changes in the household preferences, affect the bank's asset allocation decisions and are beneficial to households.

These would include a Roll-Over Option Facility (ROOF) that allows the issuer, for a price, to keep the funds if at maturity a readily observable variable correlated with systemic liquidity risk (e. g. the LIBOR-OIS spread) is above a trigger threshold. At roll-over the yield would reflect the current price of liquidity and credit risk, making ROOFs attractive to investors. The instrument could attenuate a liquidity crisis by reducing banks’ need to roll debt over or sell off assets, and diminish the probability of runs, if markets are convinced that banks can secure sufficient liquidity when needed thanks to the widespread use of this contingent claim. funding, liquidity, contingent claim, financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of 2007, global {{financial}} markets went through noticeable periods of turbulence. In particular, complex credit markets suffered a marked set-back. Oddly, turmoil in these fairly new markets contributed to severe liquidity shortages in short-term money and interbank markets, triggering repeated large-scale monetary interventions by central banks worldwide. Recent events have thus demonstrated that banks are considerably intertwined in fi nancial markets; dependent on and exposed to them as regards liquidity. The aim {{of this article is}} to better understand this complex relationship and to frame relevant aspects of the latest fi nancial market turmoil accordingly. In particular, we explore the mechanics of a market liquidity crisis and its impact on individual banks’ liquidity, as well as possible spillovers to other banks. These dynamics of course raise a number of policy issues. Here, we focus on the role that greater disclosure to markets on banks’ liquidity situation itself could play as a market-stabilising device. In summary, global banks have increasingly integrated into capital markets and in terms of both funding and asset liquidity rely considerably on functioning, liquid financial markets. This is particularly visible in the shift towards secured lending transactions; growth of the securitisation market; the broadening of collateral to encompass complex products with shifting levels of market liquidity; and the rise in committed credit or liquidity lines to sponsored special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and corporates. While some of the recent developments in fi nancial market liquidity can be attributed to technological progress, importantly, more temporary factors resulting from an environment of low interest rates have accelerated market liquidity beyond sustainable levels. While, per se, banks’ ability to “liquify” assets represents a positive development which should help mitigate the fundamental liquidity risk that banks face, increased sensitivity with respect to market liquidity risk has also created new vulnerabilities with respect to sudden reversals of market liquidity. Importantly, adverse circumstances could trigger a combined increase in demands on liquid assets via margin requirements and activation of credit lines and reduced liquidity of assets and related market funding sources. The severe loss of liquidity in asset-backed securities markets and its repercussions on global interbank markets during 2007 provide a vivid illustration of the channels that link market liquidity to banks’ funding and asset liquidity and of the wider externalities of idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. How can these risks be addressed? Together with active liquidity management, disclosure may represent one tool through which such vulnerability may be reduced. A large literature exists on the merits of transparency in banking. Greater transparency should alleviate refi nancing frictions related to asymmetric information. When information problems are however deeper and concern aggregate uncertainty, improved disclosure on credit fundamentals may be less effective to restore confidence. Instead, better information on liquidity itself may be necessary. We explore the current availability of information on banks’ liquidity and funding risks. Overall, information appears to be limited –failing to disclose in a comprehensive and comparable way the underlying dynamics of liquidity demands and funding sources. But liquidity is volatile and banks are subject to inherent <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatches.</b> Can greater disclosure in this area ever be a useful tool to reinforce market discipline in a systemically stabilising fashion? While this question merits serious reflection, the 2007 market events have shown that current information gaps are large and need addressing. ...|$|R
40|$|Liquidity shocks are a core {{risk of the}} {{business}} model of commercial banks, which is founded on a <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the banks' liabilities and assets.

Having argued that leaving the solution to this problem to the banks alone is unsafe, this article turns to examine three regulatory strategies for reducing the incidence of liquidity shocks or making banks more resilient to them. They are: regulating the level of banks' liquidity reserves, insuring the value of the banks' long-term assets and guaranteeing the discharge of the banks' short-term liabilities. The criteria of assessment are the least impact on the banks' social role of transforming short-term deposits into long-term loans, coupled with the least incentive for banks to take excessive risk, the least subsidy to banking and the least cost to the public purse. It is suggested that insuring the value of the banks' long-term assets emerges as the most attractive strategy...|$|E

This {{thesis is}} a nexus of three topics; {{financial}} stability, banking regulation and financial influence. In four separate chapters, this work examines how financial institutions {{interact with their}} regulators, in particular after the financial crisis of 2008. Size, incentives, guarantees, moral hazard, treatment, capture and influence {{play an important role}} in the analysis. The first chapter focusses on the relation between bank size and support, confirming the hypothesis that bank size is positively related to support ratings. It also finds evidence that the effect is non-linear, confirming the ‘too-big-to-rescue’ theory. Chapter two tests whether the expectation of individual and systemic government support induces moral hazard. It shows that banks tend to be more leveraged, funded with capital of lower quality, more heavily invested in risky assets and exposed to more severe <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> when they are perceived as being more likely to benefit from government support. In the last two chapters the focus is shifted to banks’ political activities and connections. Both chapters leverage a unique dataset that links U. S. banks’ sources of influence (e. g., lobbying expenditures, proximity to the relevant legislative committee, prior affiliation with regulatory or government institutions) to bank financial data, actual bank supervisory actions, and market-inferred expected government support. The findings in chapter three suggest that banks’ political influence indeed matters for the regulatory treatment of distressed banks, as well as for the expectation of support regardless of bank distress. Chapter four further dives into determinants of bank lobbying, and explores whether political connections and risk taking influence the decision to lobby. In combination, these findings are instructive for understanding the political landscape surrounding banks and their regulators. It also helps us to have a broader understanding of what drives government support to banks, and how in turn that support can trigger moral hazard within banks...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{several questions}} in financial economics. A common thread {{is the study}} of conditional distributions and higher moments. The first chapter proposes state-dependent, idiosyncratic tail risk as a key driver of asset pricing dynamics. In standard models, the only sources of priced macroeconomic risk govern time- variation in aggregate consumption and/or preferences. When markets are incomplete, agents care not just about the level of consumption, but also its redistribution across agents. Administrative earnings data suggest that the conditional tails of the cross-sectional distribution of labor income growth rates are highly cyclical; its left and right tails become fatter and thinner, respectively, in recessions. These features are consistent with a model in which households are exposed to rare, very large shocks and the probability of these shocks varies over time. My paper measures, prices, and demonstrates the quantitative importance of labor market event risk. The second chapter studies investor redemption behavior from money market mutual funds in September 2008. These funds are a popular alternative to bank accounts for cash investments, particularly for large corporations and institutional investors. Like banks, MMF investments have a <b>liquidity</b> <b>mismatch</b> between assets and liabilities that can create the potential for a run. There is an active debate about the mechanisms generating run-like behavior, particularly about the importance of strategic complementarities [...] investors' self-fulfilling beliefs about other investors' actions (i. e. "panic"). Data from the money market provide empirical evidence of the quantitative importance of complementarities in the data. Another area of asset pricing where time-varying distributions becomes important is option pricing. The third chapter studies the relationship between the option-implied distribution of market returns and estimates of the distribution obtained from time series methods. The ratio of the two densities, the pricing kernel, provides "model-free" insights about preferences. Standard models predict that the pricing kernel should be a monotonically decreasing function of the market return, but many estimates violate this property. We develop a formal, nonparametric test of pricing kernel monotonicity, provide general conditions under which the test is applicable, then perform the test using S&P 500 options data. We frequently reject the hypothesis of monotonicit...|$|E
