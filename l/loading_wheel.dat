40|$|This paper evaluates an {{approach}} for predicting rut formation in asphalt concrete (AC) layers. The approach {{is based on}} a linear viscoelastic model for predicting permanent vertical strain in AC layers subjected to a moving load. The input data are tyre pressure, loading speed, lateral wandering of <b>loading</b> <b>wheel,</b> shear modulus and phase angle of AC layer. The analytical approach takes into consideration the change in material characteristics in respect of temperature and changes in the air void content of AC layers due to repeated loading. The approach is verified by a full-scale accelerated loading test at different temperatures. The approach has shown good agreement as regards the prediction of flow rutting in AC layers. In addition, the approach is capable of calculating rutting profiles including the upheaval, which is important for estimating rut depth...|$|E

After analyzing the load transfer using {{the most commonly used}} brand of tires for BelAZ- 75471 35 -inch rim size (Fig. 7 - 10), it was found that an increase in the road longitudinal slope from 0 to 10 % of the largest value for the overload of the rear wheels have tires Belshina 21. 00 - 35 ? 9. 2 %, which begins after the slope of 1. 5 %. When going down too, the greatest congestion has Belshina 21. 00 - 35, which is 15. 4 %. Smaller values have overload tires Michelin 21. 00 R 35, which, when moving up cargo truck overloading are at an angle of 10 % of the rear tires of 0. 6 %, while driving down the overload of the front ? 7. 4 %.

40|$|Low-volume roads with an AADT {{less than}} 3000 make up 90 % of the Norwegian road network. Although {{considerable}} effort {{is being made}} to improve its quality, deterioration of existing low-volume roads is a significant concern. There are many deterioration mechanisms which affect Norwegian low-volume roads. The literature study conducted for this thesis found that permanent deformation and rutting in the asphalt pavement caused by heavy traffic loads and climatic conditions {{one of the most}} substantial types of distress on low-volume roads. Polymer modification of bitumen has been shown to improve the stability of asphalt pavements and significantly reduce rutting. The literature regarding use of polymer modified bitumen on low-volume roads is, however, limited. This study will investigate the effect polymer modification of bitumen has on the deformation characteristics of low-traffic asphalt pavements. Low-volume roads with a high percentage of heavy vehicles are exposed to greater traffic loads than regular low-volume roads. To increase pavement lifetime, it is possible to use polymer modified binder instead of neat bitumen. Research reviewed during the work for this thesis show improved resistance to permanent deformation and rutting of asphalt mixtures containing polymer modified bitumen. To evaluate the potential polymer modified bitumen has for use in pavements for low-volume roads with considerable amounts of heavy traffic, an experimental program was carried out. Performance Grading of two polymer modified binders and two neat bitumens was done, and Multiple Stress Creep Recovery Test was conducted to evaluate and compare the two polymer modified binders under heavy traffic <b>loading.</b> <b>Wheel</b> Track testing of AC 11 mixtures with neat and polymer modified bitumen was used to assess the effect of polymer modified binder has on rutting resistance. The results of the PG-classification show that the two polymer modified binders meet the criteria for permanent deformation resistance at both higher and lower temperatures for rutting and low-temperature cracking respectively than the neat bitumens. Comparison of two different polymer modified binders in the Multiple Stress Creep Recovery test showed that one of the modified binders had significantly improved rutting resistance under heavy traffic loads. The results from the Wheel Track test indicate that use of polymer modified binder can significantly decrease rutting in asphalt concrete mixture. Based on the results acquired from the laboratory testing and research reviewed during the literature study, it seems likely that an increase in pavement lifetime can be expected if using polymer modified bitumen on low-volume roads with a considerable amount of heavy traffi...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{understanding}} of tire-pavement interaction {{is important for}} the accurate analysis of load-induced stresses and strains in the pavement structure. This dissertation focuses on the analysis of the mechanism of tire-pavement interaction and the effect of tire-pavement interaction on pavement responses using a decoupled modeling approach. First, an air-inflated three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) tire model was built and the interaction between a tire and a non-deformable pavement surface was simulated. The tire is modeled as a composite structure including rubber and reinforcement. The steady-state tire rolling process was simulated using an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation. The developed tire-pavement interaction model is used to evaluate the mechanism of load distribution at the tire-pavement interface under various tire loading and rolling conditions. After that, a 3 -D FE model of flexible pavement was developed to analyze pavement responses under various loading scenarios. This model utilizes the implicit dynamic analysis, simulates vehicular loading as a continuous moving load, and incorporates 3 -D contact stresses at the tire-pavement interface. In the pavement model, the asphalt layer is modeled as a linear viscoelastic material and the granular base layer is modeled as a nonlinear anisotropic material. The FE pavement model was used to analyze critical pavement responses in thin and thick asphalt pavements considering different damage mechanisms. This dissertation concludes that knowledge of tire-pavement contact stress distributions is critical for pavement response prediction. Most importantly, the non-uniform distribution of vertical contact stresses and the localized tangential contact stresses should be considered in the mechanistic-empirical pavement design. The contact stress distributions at the tire-pavement interface are affected by vehicle <b>loading</b> (<b>wheel</b> load and tire inflation pressure), tire configuration (dual-tire assembly and wide-base tire), vehicle maneuvering (braking/acceleration and cornering), and pavement surface friction. Therefore, pavement damage should be quantified using accurate loading inputs that are represented by realistic tire-pavement contact stress distributions. Thin and thick asphalt pavements fail in different ways. Multiple distress modes could occur in thin asphalt pavements, including bottom-up fatigue cracking and rutting in each pavement layer. It was found that the interaction between the viscoelastic asphalt layer and the nonlinear anisotropic granular base layer plays an important role for the stress distribution within a thin asphalt pavement structure under moving vehicular loading. In thick asphalt pavements, near-surface cracking is a critical failure mechanism, which is affected by the localized stress states and pavement structure characteristics. Particularly, the effect of shear stress on the formation of near-surface cracking at multi-axial stress states is important and can not be neglected, especially at high temperatures...|$|E
