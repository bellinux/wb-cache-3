5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

It is clear that Lawrence's understanding of heredity was well ahead of his time, (ahead of Darwin, in fact) and that he only lacks the idea of selection to have a fully-fledged theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
25|$|The pittas are {{strongly}} territorial, with territories varying {{in size from}} 3000 m² in the African pitta to 10,000m² in the rainbow pitta. Pittas will perform territory defence displays {{on the edges of}} their territories, although fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its legs straight and bows to a rival on the edge of territory, while making a purring call. Displays <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird's daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories in addition to their breeding ones.|$|E

25|$|Photocatalytic {{coatings}} {{are those}} that include components (additives) that catalyze reactions, generally through a free radical mechanism, when excited by light. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) of a material provides a measure of its reactive potential, based {{on the ability of}} the material to create an electron hole pair when exposed to ultra-violet light. Free radicals formed can oxidize and therefore breakdown organic materials, such as latex binders found in waterborne coatings. Antimicrobial coatings systems take advantage of this by including photocatalytically active compounds in their formulations (i.e. titanium dioxide) that cause the coating to “flake” off over time. These flakes carry the microbes along with them, leaving a “clean” coating behind. Systems <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> often described to be self-cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches {{has been found to be}} most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E

500|$|... }} Emission lines usually {{indicate}} that a star is surrounded by gas. In {{the case of a}} Be star, the gas is typically {{in the form of an}} equatorial disk, resulting in electromagnetic radiation that emanates not just from the photosphere, but from the disk as well. The geometry and kinematics of this gaseous circumstellar environment are therefore best explained by a [...] "Keplerian" [...] diskone that is supported against gravity by rotation rather than gas or radiation pressure. Circumstellar disks <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> sometimes referred to as [...] "decretion disks", which is material being actively ejected by the star as opposed to [...] "accretion disks" [...] which involves material falling toward the star.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{the scene}} with the burning camp was [...] "tricky", {{according}} to Kim Manners. When they were filming the scene, they had huge [...] "safety precautions" [...] ready for the cast and crew. The fires seen in the episode, were in reality propane fires. Manners wanted the shots to be {{as close to the}} fire as possible, so they used fireproof cameras. According to Manners, [...] "they used a half a million dollar camera on a crane wrapped in asbestos" [...] and ran it through the flames. For the following scene, the production crew set a man on fire, while using a fire suit. This stunt is known as [...] a [...] "full burn." [...] Scenes <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> [...] "very dangerous" [...] as one can't breathe. In total, he was on fire between 25–30 seconds, which is seen as a lot by filming standards.

500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Chis Payne commented for Billboard magazine: [...] "Evancho’s stratospheric vocals are {{of course}} {{impressive}} for someone her age, though pipes <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> incredible for just about anyone." [...] in 2015, the reviewer for Digital Journal wrote: [...] "The control she displays over her voice is tremendous, and she tackles the high notes ... effortlessly, showcasing her angelic vocals and piercing pipes." [...] Robin Leach wrote of Evancho's 2015 concert in Las Vegas: [...] "She’s still got the voice of an angel. It’s remarkable, and her power is growing as she grows up. [...] had the audience on its feet with wild applause {{at the end of}} every song". Some reviewers, beginning in 2015, noticed a lack of connection with the text; a review in The Washington Post called her voice a [...] "bell-like instrument, devoid of any messy human emotions [...] an ethereally floating tone. ... But imagine what Evancho can achieve once she stops obsessing over just sounding pretty, and actually listens to the words she’s singing." [...] Reviewing one of Evancho's 2016 concerts, Steve Barnes similarly wrote for the Times Union that her voice is [...] "an instrument of pristine beauty. It peals with the purity of bells and lofts tones that shimmer with celestial iridescence" [...] but that her performance lacks [...] "an apparent interpretive style or emotional connection to the material".|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E
