40|$|The H-Canyon at Savannah River Site {{is a large}} {{concrete}} structure designed for chemical separation processes of radioactive material. The facility requires a <b>large</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> to maintain negative pressure in process areas for radioactive contamination control and personnel protection. The ventilation exhaust is directed through a concrete tunnel under the facility which is approximately five feet wide and 8 feet tall {{that leads to a}} sand filter and stack. Acidic vapors in the exhaust have had a degrading effect {{on the surface of the}} concrete tunnels. Some areas have been inspected; however, the condition of other areas is unknown. Experience from historical inspections with remote controlled vehicles will be discussed along with the current challenge of inspecting levels below available access points. The area of interest in the exhaust tunnel must be accessed through a 14 X 14 inch concrete plug in the floor of the hot gang valve corridor. The purpose for the inspection is to determine the condition of the inside of the air tunnel and establish if there are any structural concerns.

40|$|Ventilation {{corresponds}} to {{a large part of}} the total energy use of a building and a lot of attention has been paid to how to reduce this energy use. However, much of this work on saving energy has been focused on reduction of the airflows and how this in turn reduces the energy use. In this study it is shown that lowered airflows does not automatically result in reduced fan energy. Instead this dissertation is focused on design of <b>large</b> and complex <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> to obtain good function and low energy use, both the prerequisites for the design and actual solutions. In this work the energy use has been mostly limited to fan energy and how to reduce the pressure levels and flow resistances in the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> Another aspect that has not been widely studied is the interaction between demands and <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> design. This becomes important when working to optimise <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> and especially so for demand controlled <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> Demand control <b>ventilation,</b> DCV, is a concept that normally refers to a <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with variable airflows. In such a system the airflows are reduced when the demands so permits in order to save energy. This study discusses the concept of DCV from a broader perspective and shows how the demands affect the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> design. In systems with variable airflows pressure levels and pressure losses becomes even more important than in conventional systems with constant airflows. This dissertation is based on measurement studies combined with experiences gathered from building services engineers, manufacturers and so on, literature survey and basic fluid dynamics. Based on these results from the measurements simple models were made and used for simulations. Measurement results and calculations were than analyzed for both the air-conditioning and air distribution systems, using all this information some alternative <b>ventilations</b> <b>system</b> designs are presented and discussed. To show the saving potential for the fan energy with these new designs, calculations were done for an existing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> in a hospital. Based on measurements and design data a basic model for this system was created. This showed that for this representative existing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> it would be possible to save 14 % of the presently used fan energy.

40|$|Purpose / Context –The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} indoor environment and energy saving performance of houses, which employ passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> built in mild climate region and hot humid region in Japan. Methodology / Approach – In this study, investigation of passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> such as passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> and solar heating panels, have been conducted by two steps. The first step is real measurement of indoor environment and heating energy in houses employing passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> The second is analysis of total primary energy consumption of heating, cooling and ventilation by using a computational program based on the extended heating degree method. Results – From the measurement results, a passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> can be used in the regions from the viewpoint of the indoor environment. From the calculations results, a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with a self regulating damper yields less energy than typical mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> It is confirmed that a solar heating panel have a positive effect on heating energy reduction even in hot humid region. Key Findings / Implications – In mild climate region, indoor environment of the house employing a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> have almost met the reference values of the Act on Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings in Japan.

Although a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> has advantages over a local exhaust hood, some laborious adjustments are required. The pertinence of the adjustments is uncertain {{because it is}} difficult to evaluate the performance of a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> quantitatively. In this study, a measurement of the capture efficiency of a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was carried out by means of a tracer gas method. The capture efficiency decreased to 39. 3 – 78. 5 % when blockage material, a dummy worker and a cross draft, were set in the ventilation zone, but the efficiency was 95. 1 – 97. 9 % when the cross draft was stopped.
