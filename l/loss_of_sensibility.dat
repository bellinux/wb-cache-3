40|$|BACKGROUND: Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) or {{desmoid tumor}} {{of the head}} and neck region is a rare, usually unresectable, benign soft tissue tumor with locally {{aggressive}} behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 31 -year-old woman presented with a progressive trismus, a swelling in the retromandibular area, as well as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> of the maxillary and mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. MRI {{of the head and}} neck revealed an infiltrative mass involving the masticator, parapharyngeal, and prevertebral and paravertebral space on the left with intracranial extension through the orbital fissure. After the fifth biopsy, 15 months after presentation, the diagnosis of AF was made. The tumor was unresectable, so intensity-modulated radiotherapy was given with curative intent using a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy. After 16 months, she showed progressive disease, for which tamoxifen 40 mg twice daily was started with a good response for 2 years. After that, she started with sorafinib, on which she has stable disease now. CONCLUSION: The often long delay in proper diagnosis and the treatment challenges of a desmoid tumor are illustrated in this case.

40|$|Dexterity was {{investigated}} in right-handed subjects in the subacute phase of a first unilateral subcortical middle cerebral artery stroke affecting {{the left or right}} hemisphere and right-handed healthy subjects. Dexterity was quantified at both hands by kinematic recordings of finger and hand tapping, a reach-to-grasp movement, quantitative analysis of grip forces in a grasp-lift task and clinical rating scales. Stroke subjects exhibited significant deficits in timing and coordination of tapping movements at both the contralesional and ipsilesional hands, irrespective of the hemisphere affected. Likely for the reach-to-grasp and grasp-lift movements a bilateral impairment was found in stroke subjects. In particular, slowing of hand transport towards the object, deficient timing and scaling of grasp formation, discoordination between grip and lift forces and inefficient scaling of grip forces were observed. The severity of impairment was independent of the hemisphere affected and evident for both the reach (involving more proximal muscles of the arm) and grasp (involving more distal muscles of the arm and hand) components of the task. Strong correlations were found between clinical scores of hand function and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> with the deficits in timing, coordination and efficiency of movement of the contralesional and ipsilesional hand.

The comparison, conducted on 3750 manual reviewed cases, gave very different results in terms of sensibility and specificity with no one single criterion satisfying for both. Based on personal experience, variations of these CIDP criteria were tried, but the results were not improved. Then a radically different approach was developed, programming the HIS-KBS to discover better criteria in order {{of their ability to}} comply with the manual review of cases. The result was a strong reduction of false positives with minimal <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> By reverse engineering of the computer generated criteria it was possible to obtain some new interesting neurologic suggestions such as the role of H reflex. In conclusion, four points appear of general interest: 1) a large HIS-KBS is fundamental for developing and testing diagnostic criteria and medical procedures, particularly when they are complex; 2) Computer aided discovery may create rules that allows the KBS to replicate the human expertise; 3) reverse engineering on computer generated rules may suggest new physiopathological considerations; 4) this methodology has general application to many other fields of medicine...|$|E
50|$|The theory <b>of</b> {{dissociation}} <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> rests largely upon Eliot’s {{description of}} the disparity in style that exists between the metaphysical poets of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century and the poets of the late seventeenth century onward. In “The Metaphysical Poets,” Eliot claims that the earlier grouping of poets were “constantly amalgamating disparate experience” and thus expressing their thoughts through the experience of feeling, while the later poets did not unite their thoughts with their emotive experiences and therefore expressed thought separately from feeling. He explains that the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> {{is the reason for}} the “difference between the intellectual and the reflective poet.” The earlier intellectual poet, Eliot writes, “possessed a mechanism <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> which could devour any kind of experience.” When the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> occurred, “the poets revolted against the ratiocinative, the descriptive; they thought and felt by fits, unbalanced; they reflected.” Thus dissociation <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> is the point at which and the manner by which this change in poetic method and style occurred; it is defined by Eliot as the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sensation united with thought.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} tactile discrimination performance under various active and passive conditions and {{explore the influence of}} visual information. Participants had to discriminate the direction of lateral pin strokes on their fingertip under three conditions. In one condition (static) only tactile stimulation was provided. In a second condition (active) the shear force device was mounted on a kinesthetic feedback device so that tactile stimulation was accompanied by active arm movements. In a third condition (passive) the arm was moved passively using the kinesthetic device while subjects performed the discrimination task. In this first experiment vision was not controlled. Therefore, {{to investigate}} the influence of vision on tactile discrimination performance participants had to perform the tactile discrimination task in the active condition with either direct gaze on their hand, gaze on a live image of their hand or without sight of their hand. Results show that tactile discriminatio n performance was higher in the static compared to the active condition. Moreover, participants performed better when they were gazing on their hand compared to the no-sight condition. We conclude that active movement impairs tactile discrimination performance. However visual spatial attention can compensate to some degree for this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> tactile <b>sensibility...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{inverted}} nipple is {{a frequent}} pathologic condition, involving up to 10 % of women. This deformity results in a negative self-image for the affected patient. Recurrence after corrective surgery is possible and may represent extreme frustration for {{the patient and the}} surgeon. The aim of our study is to propose a useful and reliable technique to employ in case of recurrence or severe inverted nipple. During 2000 and 2010, the study was conducted on 19 patients treated with this procedure: 10 patients (20 nipples) having severe inverted nipple (grade III according to Han and Hong classification) and 9 patients (15 nipples) presenting with relapses. One nipple could not be corrected. One patient developed a temporary <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> No major complications (necrosis, infection, hematoma, and permanent numbness), no recurrences, and no noticeable scars have been reported at follow-up. In our series, the shape and the projection after the procedure were evaluated as satisfactory by the patients, remained consistent over time, and no protective devices were required. In conclusion, although our technique is not the best in terms of invasiveness, {{it is one of the}} few truly effective ones in treating relapses. For patients who have already undergone surgery, the priority is certainly to solve this clinical anomaly and the psychological sequelae; a "microincision" or a scar-free technique is the secondary aspect to be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Idiopathic trigeminal {{neuralgia}} (ITN) is an excruciating shock-like paroxysmal pain {{restricted to}} the trigeminal area of innervation, with discrete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> (thermal, tactile and painful). Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain at the trigeminal territory that persists after Herpes zoster infection, which also is associated to sensorial compromise. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the somesthetic facial sensibility (pain, thermal and tactile) and to compare the findings between PHN and ITN. Methods: 18 patients with PHN and 26 patients with ITN were diagnosed by the IASP criteria. They were evaluated with a systematic approach, which included mechanical, thermal (cold and warm) and painful stimuli. Results: We found statistical significance at the ophthalmic branch of PHN in pain (p= 0. 001), tactile (p= 0. 002), cold (p= 0. 016) and warm (p= 0. 013); in ITN, the maxillary branch had higher threshold with pinpricks (p= 0. 016) and the mandibular branch had higher tactile threshold. Conclusions: The trigeminal area affected by the disease had the higher sensorial losses (ophthalmic branch in PHN and maxillary/mandibular branches in ITN). PHN patients had losses in large and small fibers; therefore, ITN patients had the losses mostly in large fibers, which support different peripheral neural mechanisms for these neuropathic diseases.

40|$|IntroductionNeuropathic arthropathy of the {{shoulder}} is a rare condition and its physiopathology is unclear. It frequently leads to the discovering of syringomyelia, {{which is one of}} the most frequent etiology. The physiopathology would be based on <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> Our case is original because it concerns a patient with only a thermoalgesic deficit but without any anesthesia of {{the shoulder}}. ObservationThe patient is quadraplegic C 7 by C 6 -C 7 luxation because of a car accident which occurred in 1986. In 2013, he started complaining about stiffness of the left shoulder, which began progressively without initial trauma. X-rays and clinical examination made us diagnose shoulder arthrosis and capsulitis. The stiffness progressively got worse in spite of appropriate physical therapy and glucocorticoid intra-articular infiltration. Neurological examination showed sensibility loss, more pronounced on the left side, which deteriorated in 2013. At the same time, a medullar MRI had shown unknown left postero-lateral C 4 -C 5 syringomyelia. The stiffness progressively worsens so we asked for a CT-Scan. It showed a neurogenic arthropathy {{of the shoulder}}. DiscussionThe OAN physiopathology is unclear, there are two hypotheses: the neuro-traumatic diagnosis and the neuro-vascular diagnosis. Both are probably linked and have a common beginning: a sensibility loss. The new thing in this case is the maintaining of the tactile sensibility of the shoulder, whereas there is an evident loss of thermo-algesic sensibility. This is probably because of a selective compression of certain nerve fibre by the syringomyelia...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Starting {{from the}} 1980 s, {{with the advent}} of microsurgery, {{microvascular}} flaps are used for the reconstruction of wide and complex bone defects of the maxillomandibular district. Compared with conventional and implant-supported prostheses, the free flaps allow aesthetic-functional rehabilitations more adapt to answer to problems that these wide disablements involve. The anatomic characteristics of the crest flap make it one of the best available flap in the maxillomandibular bone reconstruction. METHODS: The authors introduce a retrospective analysis of their own experience in the reconstruction of wide and complex bone defects of the maxillomandibular district. Specifically, the attention is focused {{on the use of the}} iliac crest flap. The surgical technique of flap preparation is discussed. Moreover, a review of results from international studies about the morbidity of the donor site is presented and compared with own experience. RESULT: As reported in the literature, the iliac crest flap donor site may encounter several complications. Among these, chronic pain, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>sensibility</b> or paresthesias, hematoma, seroma, walking troubles, unaesthetic scars, abdominal hernia, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the normal bone profile of the hip. DISCUSSION: At present, the use of the iliac crest free flap in the microvascular reconstruction of the complex deficits of the maxillomandibular district represents a well-established method in the experience of the maxillofacial surgeon. Several information about results obtained in the maxillomandibular rehabilitation are available from the literature; however, little attention has been addressed to complications and morbidity of the donor site. Such aspect will be discussed in this work. Copyright © 2009 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD...|$|R
40|$|Central pain is neuropathic pain {{resulting}} from a lesion of the CNS, such as a stroke [poststroke central pain (CPSP) ]. Lesions involving the posterior thalamus lead to reduction or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sensation and to CPSP, although the responsible nuclei have not been identified. We now examine the hypotheses that thalamic lesions must extend posterior to the ventral caudal nucleus (Vc) and include ventral medial posterior nucleus (VMpo), to result in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>sensibility</b> and CPSP. Patients with small thalamic strokes associated with CPSP were evaluated by atlas-based mapping of magnetic resonance imaging scans, and by somatosensory testing. All lesions involved posterior Vc; two lesions also involved nuclei posterior to Vc, but not VMpo. All patients tested had alterations of cold pain sensation and tactile sensation, as measured by von Frey hairs. Three patients had altered cool sensation, and the patient with the least involvement of Vc had normal cool thresholds, suggesting that a critical volume of Vc must be involved before cool sensation is impaired. Perception of warm was impaired only in lesions involving nuclei posterior to Vc. Heat pain perception was never affected. In a subject with cold allodynia, a single-subject protocol PET study measured the responses to immersion of either hand in a 20 °C waterbath. The scan during stimulation of the affected hand was characterized by intense activation of contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Therefore, there are modality-specific subnuclear structures in the posterior thalamus, but lesions of Vc not involving VMpo are sufficient to impair cold sensibility and to produce CPSP...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients after upper extremity replantation were included in this study. The evaluation parameters were: range of motion, sensorial recovery (static two-point discrimination and Semmens-Weinstein Monofilaments (SWM)), functional evaluation Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), handgrip and pinch strength. Bilateral comparisons were done between the healthy and replanted extremity. Patient satisfaction with daily life activities was evaluated with visual analog scale. Results: The mean time period after replantation was 5. 36 ± 3. 08 years. Handgrip and pinch strength, total active motion (TAM) of fingers, also PPT of replanted extremity were significantly decreased. Patient satisfaction with daily life activities was 6. 71 ± 1. 43. Two-point discrimination of replanted extremity was found as: one point in seven, poor in one, moderate in three and normal in three patients. Results of the sensory testing: two patients presented with normal sensibility, three were with reduced light touch sensation and five had decreased protective sensibility. Three patients had <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> protective <b>sensibility</b> and one patient had no sensation.

Methods A total of 284 patients (102 males, 182 females; mean age was 14. 4 years (18. 8) years at time of OMI-Insertion) {{with a total of}} 568 OMIs (1. 7 mm diameter, length 8 mm) were retrospectively investigated. A binomial regression analysis was performed to explore covariates, such as age, gender, inclination of upper central incisors, dentition status and insertion position of OMIs that could have contributed to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> Statistical significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results Loss of response to PST was encountered during retention in 3 out of 284 patients and the respective OMIs had been placed at height of the second rugae (R- 2). Affected teeth were a right canine, a left lateral and a left central incisor. Subsequent root canal treatment was successful. Results of the binomial regression analysis revealed that the covariate insertion position (R- 2) of OMIs (p = 0. 008) had statistically significant influence on loss of response to PST. Conclusions (1) Although there was no radiographic evidence for direct root injury, the proximity of the implants to the anterior teeth was nevertheless statistically related to loss of PST. (2) In all cases of PST loss OMIs were inserted at the second rugae. Therefore OMIs should be placed either more posteriorly, at the third rugae or in the median plane. (3).

40|$|Aims: Present-day {{screening}} of the diabetic foot involves the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament Test for evaluating <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility,</b> while testing for intrinsic muscle weakness is not implied. Just as with the early detection of sensibility loss, early detection of intrinsic muscle weakness might {{have important implications for}} the prevention of both ulceration and deformity in patients with diabetes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the prevalence of patients with diabetes presenting intrinsic muscle weakness of the hallux, but with a normal sensibility of the sole of the foot. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was applied. Intrinsic muscle function of the hallux was measured with the Paper Grip Test, while sensibility of the sole of the foot was measured with the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament Test 5. 07 / 10 -g. Results: In a period of three months a total of 266 patients with diabetes (mean age 60, 134 females (50 %), 177 type 2 diabetes mellitus (67 %)) met the inclusion criteria and were examined for both intrinsic muscle weakness of the hallux and sensibility of the soles of the feet. The results showed that intrinsic muscle weakness was present more frequent in patients with impaired sensibility (P = 0. 001), also 20 % of the population had intrinsic muscle weakness in the presence of normal sensibility. Multivariate regression analysis showed that only age is associated with patients with diabetes presenting normal sensibility but impaired intrinsic muscle function (P = 0. 017).

Different refinements of the initial technique with free nipple grafts have been described to circumvent the problems of nipple underprojection, areolar hypopigmentation and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> secondary to nipple grafting, as well as lacking breast projection due to scarce glandular tissue. Techniques relying on nipple areola complex transposition, rather than grafting, have been described with inferior, superomedial and medial pedicles.

All breasts were managed with a superior pedicle and inverted T technique. The mean preoperative suprasternal notch-to-nipple distance was 44 ± 2 cm, and the resection weight ranged from 800 to 2490 g per breast with an average of about 1450 g in this patient population presenting with overweight or obesity. With a mean nipple areola complex (NAC) lift of 20 ± 3 cm, neither nipple nor areola necrosis was observed. One partial epidermolysis of the areola and two cases of delayed wound healing at the trifurcation point of the inverted T were conservatively managed. Only one re-operation was necessary for an important wound dehiscence of the lateral part of the horizontal scar.

40|$|My project {{examines}} {{death and}} barrenness images prevalent in literature produced by black women during the 1970 s and 1980 s, taking for study the novels Bluest Eye (1970), Praisesong for the Widow (1983), Corregidora (1975), and Mama Day (1988). I argue that images in these narratives represent contemporary manifestations of social death that directly relate to what {{belief in the}} American dream, unrealized, frustrates. Secondly, I argue that these images symbolize {{the ways in which}} decisions made as inspired by or in pursuit of the American dream had a deadening effect on black communities, primarily experienced as a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> social <b>sensibility</b> and vitality <b>of</b> relationships. Concomitant with this argument is one about the way in which social death masqueraded as apparent prosperity for those 2 ̆ 2 living in the American dream 2 ̆ 2 in the decades following the Civil Rights Movement, particularly the black middle class. Toni Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s character Macon Dead in The Song of Solomon inspires the title of my dissertation. I interpret his story as one about hope in a movement that would provide descendents of slaves a point of access for acquiring the American dream and participating more fully in a country where they, too, could find a 2 ̆ 2 home in this rock 2 ̆ 2 (Morrison, Song of Solomon 235). He functions as an important metaphor for a conversation about intergenerational considerations of the American dream 2 ̆ 7 s impact on the Civil Rights Movement. ...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{impairment}} {{caused by}} leprosy are agreed in the National Plan for Leprosy Control and {{are considered a}} serious public health problem. In order to prevent the advance of disabilities, the Ministry of Health proposes educational actions in self-care. However, despite the emphatic importance of performing self-care, we observe non-adherence of patients to the program, which may be explained, among other reasons, by the destruction of their body image and the stigma arising from the social representations of the "leprous" body. Thus, {{we believe in the}} importance of increasing the technicist discourse in educational actions in self-care, considering body image as an important aspect in the treatment strategies of the disease. We aim to meet the body image of people who had leprosy and developed disabilities. For this, we applied the psychological test Human Figure Drawing (HFD), with emphasis on interpretive analysis of the hands and feet, the most affected by leprosy, in five women registered and monitored by the Self-Care Program in Leprosy, in a Regional Outpatient Clinic in the district of Vale do Paraíba Paulista. The test was conducted from March to December 2009. Results revealed the inclusion or disfigurement of hands and feet. There is a lack of integration between these regions and awareness, causing disruption of body image, which may result from both <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cutaneous <b>sensibility</b> and the resulting deformity disease. It is inferred that this disruption of body image hinders adherence to self-care and socialization of these people, increasing the stigma of leprosy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bakground Knowledge: Baclofen pump {{treatment}} is used with patients with spasms and spasticity. The pump is implanted subcutaneous on the abdomen, and a spinal catheter continuously delivers the medication to the cerebrospinal fluid. Current practice is to implant the pump with an angular incision. Hypothesis: In this project we have examined {{patients with a}} baclofen pump {{with a view to}} the impact of the incision to the sensibility over the pump. Our hypothesis was that the angular incision cut through nerves in the skin, so that the sensibility to stings over the skin area punctured while filling the pump was reduced, which would lead to less discomfort for the patients when filling-up. Material and Method: We examined patients who came for a routine check-up at the neurological policlinic at Rikshospitalet. All the patients were asked to participate in the study, 9 was excluded, 7 declined, and 23 were included in the study. The patients’ sensibility was examined for 3 modalities; temperature, touch, and sting. We examined proximally and distally around the incision, in addition to {{the opposite side of the}} stomach/abdomen in order to have a reference sensibility. Results: Only 6 patients had the sensibility outcome that we had expected they would get, with a clear reduced sensibility distally by the incision. The remaining either had unchanged sensibility or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> that could not be related to the incision. Discussion: The patients’ diagnosis and time of implantation were dissimilar, however, we did not find a correlation between the different results and the different diagnoses or time of surgery. The peripheral neurones have a considerable ability of regeneration. This could indeed help explain that the cutting of the nerves in the skin during surgery seems to be of limited value. Conclusion: Our conclusion is that the value of the angular incision seems to be limited and that one should adjust the incision to each patient’s wishes, needs and anatomy...|$|E
40|$|Of 30 primary ankle fusions in {{patients}} with osteoarthrosis, 25 ankles underwent clinical evaluation by two independent observers. In 29 cases, two independent radiologists, unanimously found 26 ankles to be radiographically fused, and three not fused. The consistency between the two orthopaedic surgeons evaluations was somewhat lower. A complete consistency between the evaluations of all four observers was found in 20 of 25 cases. Thus, clinical evaluation, whether an ankle joint has fused or not, is difficult. Therefore, radiographic evaluation {{appears to be more}} reliable. 51 uncemented, consecutive STAR prostheses, implanted either due to osteoarthritis or to rheumatoid arthritis, were followed prospectively for 3 - 8 years. 12 underwent re-operation, seven due to component loosening, two due to failure of the meniscus and three for other reasons. Another eight showed radiographic signs of loosening, but are not yet revised. 31 of 39 patients who had not been re-operated were satisfied with the result. Two were somewhat satisfied, and six not satisfied. The 5 -year survival, with replacement or removal of any component as end-point was 70 %. 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis had their ankle fused using a retrograde intramedullary nail. 25 of the ankles healed radiographically at the first attempt. A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> at the plantar aspect of the foot occurred in eight cases. Although permanent, it was not a major problem for the patients. Five different nails were used and eight different surgeons had performed the operations, indicating that the method seems to be easy to learn. Ankle fusion as a salvage procedure for failed ankle prosthesis is a more complicated task than in the primary situation. In spite of that we found that 13 of 16 resulted in radigraphic healing after having been operated on with a retrogade intramedullary nail. Of 35 rheumatic ankles operated on with compression screws, 26 became radiographically healed at the first attempt and another 5 after repeat arthrodesis. The clinical outcome scores were lower than {{in patients}} undergoing the same procedure but due to osteoarthrosis. The most commonly used function scores for evaluation of the hind-foot function are not well suited to cases with rheumatoid arthritis. An ankle damaged by rheumatic disease may be successfully treated by both arthrodesis, using a retrograde intramedullary nail, or by an ankle replacement. Also an ankle injured due to trauma of the ankle may in selected cases be treated with an ankle prosthesis. When fusion is indicated, the use of compression screws seems to be reliable...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to divulge {{peripheral}} neurectomy as a method for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This essay is based on 34 personal cases which have been operated upon, following a no scar producing method, during the period comprised between October, 1947 and December, 1950. Twenty patients of the series were submitted to neurectomy of the infra-orbital branches of one maxillary nerve; eight have undergone ipsilateral neurectomy of both infra-orbital and mentonian branches; in three cases the mentonian branches of one side were ressected the frontal branches were ressected in two cases and, in one case of bilateral neuralgia, ressection of the infra-orbital branches in both sides was performed. Five patients had to be reoperated upon after a painless period superior to one year, on account of return of pain. The follow-up period of 23 out of the 34 operated patients is superior to one year; in this group are included 10 cases with a follow-up period of over two years and 4 with more than three years. Except for six patients with whom no contact could be maintained (and whose present condition we ignore), the remaining were feeling no pain {{at the time of}} the last test. During the follow-up period all the patients experienced or are still having paresthesias. In no instance, however, such abnormal sensations were so annoying as to require any therapeutic care. The loss of sensation resulting from the nerve section has a tendency to disappear after a varying period of time, the cause of which (contrary to many authors), is the regeneration of the divided nerves themselves. The return of anesthesia following a second operation (at the time when sensibility was almost normalized) is, we think, the best proof that progressive return of sensibility on the hitherto anesthetic area has nothing to do with the surrounding nerves. Facial palsy or any other serious complication were never observed; one patient had transient paralysis of the extrinsic movements of the eye on the same side that ressection of the infra-orbital branches was performed; three had suppuration and in one instance occurred a scorch due to hot compresses. Though it is still early to conclude about the actual value of peripheral neurectomy of the fifth cranial nerve as if it can or can not be considered as a method for lasting relief of neuralgic pain, our observations lead us to a few partial conclusions which can be summarized as follows: 1 - Neurectomy of the extracranial divisions of the fifth cranial nerve brings off anesthesia on the corresponding territory of the face. This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> has a tendency to disappear after a varying period of time. 2 - The return of sensibility in the anesthetic area is performed by regeneration of the divided nerves themselves. 3 - By regeneration of the sectioned nerves, recurrence of pain may occur. 4 - Alcohol injected in the proximal stump of a divided nerve does delay its regeneration. 5 - If pain returns, the patients can undergo a second operation either following the same method or any type of operation for trigeminal neuralgia. We feel that it is too early for a real evaluation of peripheral neurectomy as a lasting procedure for relief of trigeminal pain. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the operation, the possibility of a definite cure, and the fact that it will not interfere with re-operation or with a further greater procedure, lead us to suggest peripheral neurectomy as the first thing to be done in proper cases, i. e., those cases which bear the topographical requirements pointed out in a chapter of this paper...|$|E

40|$|Leprosy, {{also known}} as Hansen's Disease, has been known since biblical times. The causative {{organism}} Mycobacterium leprae is unique among bacteria in that it has an affinity to involve, infect and destroy peripheral nerves, especially those of the limbs. The disability problems in Leprosy are mainly due to the nerve trunks affected by the disease resulting in diminution or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sensation, paralysis of muscles producing deformities and autonomic nerve function impairment leading to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sweating, dryness and cracks in the hands and feet. The affected nerve from the initial stage of involvement advances to the stage of damage and finally to a stage of destruction. In the stage of initial involvement, the nerves are thickened, tender, and painful but have no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> function. In the subsequent stage of damage there is <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> sweating and <b>sensibility,</b> muscle weakness or complete paralysis. These two stages of nerve involvement and damage are amenable to prompt and adequate treatment by multi drug therapy (MDT) and steroids and recovery of lost nerve functions in possible. In the subsequent stage of nerve destruction, the involved nerve is completely damaged and cannot recover function to any useful level with all available treatment. This stage is diagnosed when the nerve has been completely paralyzed {{for at least one}} year. Leprosy involves three kinds of peripheral nerves. They are (1) dermal nerves, which are fine nerves in the skin; (2) cutaneous nerves, which are thicker nerves that are palpable under the skin and (3) major nerve trunk, which are large nerves of the limbs...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{deals with}} typical signs of female sentimental {{emotional}} response in eighteenth-century novels, including Sarah Fieldings The History of Ophelia (1760), Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise (1761), and Elizabeth Inchbald's A Simple Story (1791). The female sentimental repertoire of psychosomatic fainting, silences, sighs, palpitations and states of mental distraction is frequently taken for granted, but rarely thoroughly explored by scholarship {{dealing with the}} culture <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> This article reads these typically feminine manifestations <b>of</b> <b>sensibility</b> in terms <b>of</b> the discontents of eighteenth-century female psycho-sexual existence and self-expression. It argues that these often pathological manifestations—sometimes called the vocabulary of sensibility—figure limitations on the possibilities of feminine utterance, as these psychosomatic symptoms are rooted in a complex network of affective, social and sexual factors. The essay mainly, but not exclusively, focuses on moments <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, speech and sensation—perhaps the least understood and most neglected symptoms <b>of</b> <b>sensibility.</b> Many eighteenth-century novels use this repertoire to reflect covertly on the pathology of social repression by exposing sensibility itself, {{in the form of}} the woman of feeling as its symptom. The essay analyses literary depictions of the female psyche in moments of excitement and usually of sexual intensity, and it approaches psychologically induced states of consciousness and unconsciousness by means of a theoretical framework that connects eighteenth-century medical explanations with psychoanalytic ideas of negativity...|$|R
