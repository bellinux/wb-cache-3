5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the large gay populations in port cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco, Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Japanese Americans {{established}} fishing communities on Terminal Island and in San Diego. By 1923, {{there were two}} thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of Los Angeles Harbor. By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen. Still, areas <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco's Japan Town managed to thrive.|$|E

25|$|For years New York City {{was slow}} to embrace green {{building}} guidelines used in cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco to promote environmentally friendly construction. In the post-World War II construction boom, changes in zoning regulations and {{the widespread use of}} air conditioning led to the design of sealed glass and steel towers. Without natural sources of light and ventilation, such buildings required large amounts of fossil fuels to operate.|$|E

Some light rail lines, <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco's, allow only folding bicycles on board. In some systems dedicated bike parking is available at select stations and others are integrated with local bike share systems.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Vallejo has {{attracted}} a large community of artists to the region in search of lower rent and larger work-spaces. Artists pushed out of larger Bay Area cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco and Oakland {{have been working with}} city leaders to revitalize the once blighted downtown area. The artist-ran Vallejo Art Walk scheduled on the second Friday of every month in downtown Vallejo has been recognized as a hub for artists in the Bay Area and the entirety of California.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Chicago City Railway, also {{designed}} by Eppelsheimer, opened in Chicago in 1882 {{and went on}} to become the largest and most profitable cable car system. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of incline, but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities did, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco's California Cars, Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.|$|E

25|$|Santiago de Cali {{is located}} in a valley. The city is {{completely}} bordered by mountains to the West; the Farallones de Cali mountains are the closest to the city. The Eastern part of the city is bordered by the Cauca River. To the north and south are extended plains. In the first one you can find the industrial city of Yumbo which is part of Cali's metropolitan area, to the south you can find Jamundí, also part of the metropolitan area. The city is mainly flat, but there are areas mostly to the west that are mountainous, <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Antonio and La loma de la Cruz, which are both tourist sites.|$|E
25|$|As was {{the case}} between the 1930s and the 1970s, some border blaster {{stations}} in areas near larger American border cities such as San Diego are leased out by American broadcasting companies and air English-language programming targeting American audiences, although the AM stations have sometimes been supplanted by FM signals just over the border and able to reach major American cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Diego or El Paso with city-grade signals. During those decades border radio was used by preachers who solicited donations, and advertisers who sold products of dubious value. The American side leases the station from the Mexican station owners/license holders and feeds programming from their American studios to the Mexican transmitters via satellite.|$|E
25|$|Where signs use a language, the {{recognized}} language/s {{of the area}} is normally used. Signs {{in most of the}} US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are in English. Quebec uses French, while New Brunswick and the Jacques-Cartier and Champlain bridges, in Montreal (as well as some parts in the West Island), use both English and French, {{and a number of other}} provinces and states, such as Ontario, Manitoba, and Vermont use bilingual French–English signs in certain localities. Puerto Rico (a US territory) and Mexico use Spanish. Within a few miles of the US–Mexico border, road signs are often in English and Spanish in places <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Diego, Yuma, and El Paso. Indigenous languages, mainly Nahuatl as well as some Mayan languages, have been used as well.|$|E

25|$|While not {{on or near}} any {{fault line}} <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco or Los Angeles, Mexico City is {{vulnerable}} to earthquakes. The main {{reason for this is}} the surface geology of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in response to major flooding. The near surface geology of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area.|$|E
25|$|As the new {{voting system}} gives equal weight to jury and televoting results, a {{national}} jury result {{cannot be used}} as backup result for the televoting or vice versa. Therefore, if a country cannot deliver a valid televoting/jury result, a substitute result is calculated by the jury/televoting result of a pre-selected group of countries approved by the contest's Reference Group. The Director General of Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV), Carlo Romeo, stated on 23 February {{that the use of}} a substitute televoting result discriminated against microstates <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Marino, which only used a professional jury due to their use of the Italian phone system and would therefore have its voting representation diminished under the new system, and criticised the EBU for not contacting its members before making the decision.|$|E
25|$|California {{is a very}} geologically diverse {{region and}} varies greatly {{in the range of}} climates and terroirs that can be found. Most of the state's wine regions are found between the Pacific coast and the Central Valley. The Pacific Ocean and large bays, <b>like</b> <b>San</b> Francisco Bay, serve as {{tempering}} influences to the wine regions nearby providing cool winds and fog that balance the heat and sunshine. While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat of frost damage though springtime. To curb the threat of frost, vineyard owners will often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and smudge pots to protect the vines.|$|E
