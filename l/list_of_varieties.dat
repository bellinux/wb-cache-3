40|$|Citation: Munger, Lewis J. Kansas feeds for sheep. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: KANSAS AS A SHEEP FEEDING STATE. 1. The {{importance}} of the sheep feeding industry in the state results {{from a combination of}} natural conditions that has made Kansas one of the great meat producing states of the Union. This is well established by the facts that we are situated in a great alluvial plain noted for its production of cheap feed and surrounded by the climatic conditions which favor the grazing and feeding industry {{in all parts of the}} state. A long <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> of forage and grain crops are produced here at a minimum cost. Another great natural advantage is that our state lies between the great range country and the point where the meat grown on the range is consumed. Kansas has several great systems of railways traversing the state, entering the range country on our north, south and west, and converging at the commercial centers where are situated the great abattoirs which slaughter two-thirds of the meat produced for the world. Of these three natural conditions climate is the one of most importance. We have in Kansas that excellent climate that is just what a sheep needs to make the most gain out of every pound of feed eaten. Furthermore every scientific man knows that all feed produced on the farm must be consumes on it if the fertility of the land be maintained. We have not yet learned to appreciate the extent to which the employment of far labor in the care of live -stock during the winter season when it would otherwise be idle, has increased prosperity and made our agriculture stable...|$|E

30|$|Literature search {{showed that}} Impigno, the less notable {{of the three}} siblings, have been {{previously}} allocated in a possible kinship: noteworthy, his putative parents were Bombino bianco, {{the same as in}} our study, and Quagliano, a variety cultivated only in some alpine valleys in the north-west of Italy (Cipriani et al. 2010). This coincidence strongly suggested a synonymy between the south Italian Uva rosa antica and the north Italian Quagliano. To confirm this possibility we compared SSR profiles of Quagliano published in the European Vitis Database (available: [URL] with those we have scored for Uva rosa antica, and found identity at all analyzed loci: considering the allelic frequencies of the nine loci used in the European Vitis Database (VVS 2, MD 5, MD 7, MD 27, ZAG 62, ZAG 79, MD 25, MD 28 and MD 32) the combined Probability of Identity (PI) is 6.95438  ×  1010. Despite the other two siblings, Uva di Troia and Bombino nero, were included in the analysis of Cipriani et al. (Cipriani et al. 2010), they passed unnoticed because of the high frequency of null alleles occurrence in long-core repeat microsatellites used in that study, one of which likely being VChr- 17 a. Another earlier study (Zulini et al. 2002) had characterized Bombino bianco and Bombino nero at six common microsatellites and the two varieties resulted unrelated because of incompatible alleles at the ZAG 62 locus but there is an evident mistake in the size call and rounding of values in the Bombino nero genotype which were the only ones in the whole <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> shifted by just one unit. Recently, a large genotyping study first hypothesize the putative kinship of Uva di Troia, albeit using only 20 SSR (Lacombe et al. 2013). Notably, the authors reported that Quagliano is not only a synonym of Uva rosa antica, but also of Bouteillan noir, an old variety cultivated in the Provence region, in the southern France.|$|E

40|$|Winter {{oilseed rape}} {{is the most}} {{important}} oilseed plant grown in the Czech Republic. During recent years, rapeseed sown areas rapidly increased due to its complex usage in industry. Similarly, the rapeseed oil gains importance which is used in food industry. The successful cultivation of rapeseed includes the right cultivation technology as well as the choice of suitable variety which will be the adapted to climatic conditions of location. There are over 600 varieties to choose from based on Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species from which is about 80 varieties commonly used in practice in climatic conditions of the Czech Republic. Suitability of these varieties and their yield are tested based on variety testing conducted by ÚKZUZ. The varieties which proved to be suitable based on previous testing are recommended for cultivation and placed in Recommended <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Varieties</b> which helps farmers to orientate in new varieties in the Czech Republic. The aim of this diploma thesis is a comparison of the performance of selected varieties of rapeseed which were cultivated in semi-operational conditions in Humburky, Kralovehradecky region. In this theses yield, oil content, 1000 seed weight were compared. Two hypotheses were set: 1) Hybrid varieties reach higher height and yield 2) Oil content of liner and hybrids cultivars is equivalent Further these features were observed: plant height, pod number on the terminal raceme, stalk number on the terminal raceme, number of primary and secondary branches, height and length of yield floor and their correlation with yield. Cultivar Faktor KWS (hybrid) reached the best yield from selected varieties, yielding 5, 02 t/ ha (119, 2 % average yield). The average yields of liner and hybrids cultivars were almost equivalent (4, 16 t/ha hybrids and 4, 10 t/ha liner). The greatest difference between liner and hybrid varieties was observed in plant height. The hybrids reached 10 cm higher on the average than liner varieties. The second hypothesis about the similar oil content of hybrid and liner varietes was confirmed. Observed varieties reached both 43, 3 % of oil content...|$|E
40|$|The {{key role}} of {{international}} agricultural {{research is to}} develop technologies that wi l l have wider impacts in certain niche ecoregions that often cross national boundaries. When the potential for inter-regional transfer of research results is high, it is often economical to develop more centralized research programs catering {{to the needs of}} the ecoregion. This is also the case when the national programs are small and lack the requisite capacity to develop viable research programs. There are three types of spillovers - inter-regional, cross-commodity and price spillovers. This assessment focuses on inter-regional spillovers - external benefits from research investments undertaken beyond the state (inter-state spillovers) and national (international spillovers) boundaries. Several studies have shown that spillovers make important contributions to agriculture; hence impact assessments that ignore such effects will underestimate R&D benefits. This study is a first step towards providing a broader assessment and synthesis of inter-state and international technology transfers derived from ICRISAT's research. It brings together the available body of evidence and knowledge on technology spillovers from the major research areas - crop improvement, Natural Resources Management (NRM) and socioeconomics and policy. It provides a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> and other innovations developed in one region that have been adapted in other regions or countries. Despite its limitations, the assessment identifies several instances of technology spillovers within Africa and Asia as well as a two-way transfer of germplasm and improved cultivars across the continents. Wi th selected examples, the study tries to provide useful insights on the preferred characteristics of the technologies, the extent of spillovers, the enabling processes and constraints that limit wider adaptation. Given its wider scope and interest to 'set the scene' (based on available information) for more in-depth future studies, a deliberate attempt has been made to focus on broader issues rather than details on specific innovations. This makes it difficult to draw very robust conclusions. However, the following generic lessons and recommendations can be made. The potential for future spillover of sorghum and millet technologies from Asia to Africa is limited. This implies the need to further strengthen sorghum and millet improvement work in WCA and ESA. Given the good potential for legume intensification in Africa, a stronger pigeonpea and chickpea improvement program is needed initially in the ESA region. A regional approach to breeding and genetic enhancement of groundnuts in Africa and Asia needs further analysis. The need for crop improvement research in all regions to account for changing market conditions, shifting consumer demand and farmer requirements may limit the potential for inter-regional spillovers. In addition to continuing the challenge of focusing NRM and socioeconomic and policy research on priority strategic areas that generate wider benefits, careful priority setting will be needed to exploit the existing opportunities from inter- and intra-regional transfer of technologies in all areas of research...|$|E
40|$|Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, Unit of Seed Testing and Organic Production Control is {{responsible}} of the seed potato {{inspection and testing}} in Finland. The seed potato production area was 1290 hectares year 2006. The seed potato production is concentrated in the Nothern parts of Finland where the High Grade Region (Tyrnävä and Liminka in the Oulu region) {{for the production of}} seed potato is located. Four generations of prebasic seed (class SS, S, SEE and SE), three generations of basic seed (class EC 1, EC 2 and EC 3) and one generation of certified seed (class A or B) are produced in Finland. The seed potato inspection schema of Finland includes several steps: the field inspection, the laboratory tests of potato cyst nematodes, bacterial ring rot, brown rot and potato virus and finally the visual tuber inspection. The field inspection, sampling and visual tuber inspection are done by the authorized inspectors. For prebasic and basic seed the inspectors make two official field inspections. For certified seed only one field inspection is needed. Official requirements are set for varietal purity, rogues, potato virus, black leg (Erwinia spp.) and Rhizoctonia. During the field inspection the background information as previous crop is checked. The soil sample for testing potato cyst nematodes is taken per each hectare. The potato cyst nematodes (Globodera sp.) are quarantine organisms and the seed potato production is not possible on the field infected by the nematodes. In the autumn the tubers for winter tests in the laboratory are sampled. For bacterial ring rot a sample is 200 tubers/ha and for virus tests 200 tubers/field. Brown rot is tested as a survey of seed potato production. The testing method for bacterial ring rot (Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) and brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum) is the immunofluorescense (IF) method based on the specific antibodies. These quarantine organisms are not accepted in the seed potato production. The potato virus Y-, A-, X-, S-, M- and Potato Leaf Roll are tested once during seed potato certification process usually as the prebasic seed. For the other seed classes the potato virus Y and potato virus A are tested. For certified seed potato class A there is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> which are tested. The seed class B is not routinely tested. The testing method is ELISAtest. The seed potato companies need certificate labels before sorting and packing potatoes. A visual tuber inspection is done by the local inspectors. A sample of 400 tubers/ 50 tn is cut by knife and tubers are inspected one by one. There are requirements for soil, dry and wet rot, external blemishes, common scab, black scurf, skin spot and deep-pitted scab. The quarantine organisms or visual symtops of moptop virus or tobacco rattle virus are not accepted. If all steps of inspection and testing are according to legislation, the seed potato lot is officially certified and can be marketed as seed potato to the farmers. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E
