It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Python is also used in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.|$|E

25|$|In late 1998, {{tools and}} {{documentation}} allowing I-War players {{to modify the}} game were released. The package only provided means to modify and create mission scripts and dialogue, as well to unlock some game's locked features like more free interstellar travel. To create and texture new in-game models, like ships and space stations, 3D modeling software with support for NewTek's proprietary <b>LightWave</b> 3D-model format was needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 the Bell System {{broke up}} into the various Baby Bell {{operating}} companies and AT. As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included <b>lightwave</b> components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period. In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the <b>Lightwave</b> unit. The <b>Lightwave</b> unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT into Lucent Technologies.|$|E

50|$|Electrodynamics is {{the physics}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, and electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For example, in optics two or more coherent <b>lightwaves</b> may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from {{the sum of the}} component irradiances of the individual <b>lightwaves.</b>|$|R

25|$|HMFGs were {{initially}} slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle {{be lower than}} those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 μm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-IR spectroscopy, fiber optic sensors, thermometry, and imaging. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided <b>lightwave</b> transmission in media such as YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers at 2.9 μm, as required for medical applications (e.g. ophthalmology and dentistry).|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the Reading Works' {{work force}} stood at 2,450 {{including}} AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as {{it made the}} transition from AT into Lucent Technologies. The spin off of AT manufacturing units as Lucent Technologies became necessary as these units increasingly found that their prospective customers were AT competitors. The divestiture of the manufacturing units made them suppliers rather than competitors, opening up new markets to Lucent and to the Reading Works. At {{the same time it}} caused the anxiety that comes with change. On October 1, 1996, Lucent Technologies became independent of AT The Reading Works became Lucent Technologies Reading Facility. It employed 2,177 people, down considerably from 4,900 in 1985. By the end of 1997, the Reading Facility workforce had declined and remained stable at 2,000. By the end of 1998, the Reading Facility workforce had rebounded to 2,177. In 1999 a pickup in <b>Lightwave</b> business caused expansion of both the Reading Facility and the Breinigsville plant.|$|E
25|$|A {{colloidal}} crystal is {{a highly}} ordered array of particles that forms over a long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); colloidal crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. It {{has been known for}} many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations, with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident <b>lightwave.</b> In these cases in nature, brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves according to Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the separation parameter d is much larger than for true crystals.|$|E

40|$|Technical Building {{to each of}} 64 antennas over optical fiber. Two high-coherence and phase-locked <b>lightwaves</b> are {{transmitted}} that are separated by a variable frequency ranging from 27 - 142 GHz. The round-trip stabilized fiber optic distribution system has been previously described in this memo series [1 - 3, 13]. In August of 2003, a first generation version of the line length correction system was tested on a prototype ALMA antenna. These were the first systematic measurements of the system on the moving structure. During these measurements we noticed an undesirable and unexpected phase fluctuation which was correlated with the antenna azimuth and elevation position. Those tests are described in an internal test report [4]. Further tests and meetings took place {{in an effort to}} resolve this issue [5 - 8]. In addition, an ALMA memo was written describing a theoretical treatment of the measured phase fluctuation [9], supporting the measurement results which showed that the phase fluctuation was due to the absolute polarization change (caused by the fiber movement) of the two <b>lightwaves,</b> and that the phase fluctuation magnitude was inversely proportional to the degree of polarization alignment of the two <b>lightwaves.</b> To put it another way, if the state-of-polarizations (SOPs) of the two <b>lightwaves</b> were different at the receiver end, then any movement of the fiber would cause a phase change. The purpose of this memo is to summarize the main points from the references listed above, and additionally to describe more recent measurements that utilize improvements to the 1 st LO reference baseline design.

25|$|Mullich {{contracted}} the Dreamers Guild {{to do the}} programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine {{was seen as an}} ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director John Bolton adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in the mind of a mad god who can make anything happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and <b>LightWave.</b> Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators.|$|E
25|$|The Reading Plant's heritage, {{combined}} with constant innovation and product quality, positioned the Reading site {{as one of}} the largest semiconductor facilities in the world. In 2000, Lucent Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as Agere Systems with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. Agere Systems Inc. produced high-tech components such as opto-electronics products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and integrated circuits, which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The opto-electronics parts were used in systems such as submarine communication cables, cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and network computing devices. The integrated circuits were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to video equipment and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated <b>lightwave</b> business materialized. In 2001, Agere Systems's stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works. These layoffs continued in waves as conditions in the semiconductor market deteriorated {{and by the end of}} the year only had a workforce of 1,546.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Bob Sertner {{wanted the}} film to have higher-end special effects to mimic the quality of those seen in feature films. [...] To do this, the film uses visual computer effects created by special effects company Area 51 FX, which created over 100 different shots using the digital modeling program <b>LightWave</b> 3D. During shooting, special effect supervisor Craig Weiss noted that the scenes with Randy Quaid were particularly difficult to capture on film due to his appearing in multiple scenes where his character was chased by twisters and surrounded by their destructive aftermaths. The actors also faced new challenges, as the film often replaced traditional green screen setup, where the special effects were added during editing, with live shots taken with the effects {{in place at the}} same time. Nancy McKeon, who was pregnant with her first child during production, filmed some of her scenes using a green screen. She found the experience to be fun, noting that it challenges actors to use their imaginations while performing.

500|$|The New Zealand {{visual effects}} studio Weta Digital was {{initially}} selected {{to assist in}} creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not {{in the same way that}} we saw in The Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a pretty interesting look."

500|$|The {{company had}} no {{standardization}} of level design tools. Leighton said, [...] "Some people used 3D Studio Max, some used <b>Lightwave,</b> and one designer even wrote his own custom modeler from scratch". This practice {{led to an}} inconsistent quality across the game's levels. For example, one designer would create structures with great geometry but bad texturing, while another would create the opposite. Once the structures were modeled individually, they were all imported into a custom editor, called D3Edit, so that the designers could [...] "glue everything together". The D3Edit editor received constant updates because it initially did not feature an intuitive interface for designers. It {{was not until the}} last third of the development period that the editor improved significantly. As Leighton notes, [...] "Even in the shipped game you can tell which levels were made early on and which were made {{near the end of the}} production cycle. The later levels are much better looking, have better frame rates, and generally have better scripts". Developers also considered the idea of shipping the game with a level editor based on the one they used to create the game's levels. However, due to the constant changes the developers made to their own editor, it was hard for them to design a more user-friendly one from the start.|$|E
