500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|At this action, activists {{demonstrated}} their thorough {{knowledge of the}} FDA drug approval process. ACT UP presented precise demands for changes that would make experimental drugs available more quickly, and more fairly. [...] "The success of SEIZE CONTROL OF THE FDA can perhaps best be measured by what ensued in the year following the action. Government agencies dealing with AIDS, particularly the FDA and NIH, began to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> to include us in decision-making, even to ask for our input." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that unlike in Adygea (22% Circassian as of 2003) and Karachay–Cherkessia (11-16%, depending on if the Abazins are considered Circassian, in 2003), Kabardino-Balkaria has a clear Circassian (of the Kabardin subdivision) majority (at 55%). However, [...] "after the parliament of KBR ratified the bill ‘On land and territory’ earlier this month, each Balkar living in KBR in turn has received 10.6 hectares of the land while only 1.6 hectares belong to each Circassian" [...] noted Jelyabi Kalmykov, and this soon became a rallying cry at the protest. Ruslan Keshev, the leader of the Circassian Congress in Kabardino-Balkaria declared that [...] "If the government does not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> we are ready for radical actions. This is the only homeland we have." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{turned to}} the doctor. He took me {{completely}} by surprise. No incredulous smile appeared on his face; no jesting words passed his lips. He was <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> attentively. He was waiting gravely to hear more.|$|R
60|$|PERSIAN. He will <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> if we {{come with}} her picture in our mouths. He will conquer and kill her brother, and reign in Egypt with Cleopatra for his Queen. And {{we shall be}} her guard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm 'most {{afraid you}} are going to find it {{difficult}} to get those boys," [...] he said. [...] "One could fancy these people had affairs of their own to discuss, and it's by no means certain that they'll even <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in the meanwhile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Jim said slowly, [...] "it can't be helped, so {{we might}} as well look cheerful. Neither Bob nor the {{engineer}} would <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> if we said the tug ought to be abandoned, and our only chance is to hurry up with the work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bless me, Jenny, do {{tell us if}} {{your father}} has been <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all this time!" [...] was the next exclamation; and {{forthwith}} there was a whir and rustle of the silken wings, as the whole troop fluttered into my study.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad Slover got out alive. He {{was against}} the march all along. If Crawford had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> he would have averted this terrible affair and saved his own life. Lew, did Slover know how many men got out?" [...] asked Jonathan.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{nearly ten}} years Heckewelder has {{anticipated}} trouble from hostile savages," [...] said Edwards, [...] "but {{so far he}} has always averted it.

6000|$|But outside, {{beyond the}} line, the natives murmured loud their discontent. [...] "The Queen of the Clouds {{stays in the}} King of the Rain's hut to-night," [...] they muttered, angrily. [...] "She will not <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Before morning, be sure, the Tempest will be born of their meeting to destroy us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's somethin' I ain't able to answer," [...] Jim replied gravely. [...] "These old sailors are queer fish, an' {{nobody can}} ever tell {{what kind of}} a scheme they're likely to strike. This much is certain, though.

5000|$|Let {{the other}} person do {{a great deal of}} the talking. People do not like <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> boast, they enjoy doing the talking themselves. Let them {{rationalize}} and talk about the idea, because it will taste much sweeter to them in their own mouth.|$|R

60|$|At this point, Aunt Dahlia, who {{had taken}} one nibble at her whatever-it-was-on-toast and laid it down, begged us--a little fretfully, I thought--for heaven's sake to cut out the {{cross-talk}} vaudeville stuff, as she had enough to bear already without having to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> doing our imitation of the Two Macs. Always willing to oblige, I dismissed Jeeves with a nod, and he flickered {{for a moment and}} was gone. Many a spectre would have been less slippy.|$|E
6000|$|At lunch that day, Hilda played {{her first}} card with delicious unconsciousness--apparent unconsciousness; for, when she chose, {{she was a}} consummate actress.

Hilda seized the opportunity. [...] "What did you say was her name?" [...] she asked, blandly.|$|E
60|$|It is {{exceedingly}} desirable that {{all parts of}} this great confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so.

Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them.|$|E
6000|$|... "She knows," [...] {{the girl}} gently assured him. They were {{seated at the}} moment in the library and the morning was very warm and silent.

6000|$|... "What a {{delightful}} voice you have!" [...] cried the Frog. [...] "Really {{it is quite}} like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world. You will hear our glee-club this evening. We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, {{and as soon as}} the moon rises we begin. It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us. It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few words}} now to Republicans. It is {{exceedingly}} desirable that {{all parts of}} this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with another.

6000|$|There was {{a certain}} priest named John Ball, who, before the {{rebellion}} broke out, had done much to enlighten the people as to their rights, and had attempted to induce them to seek redress at first in a peaceable manner. He used to make speeches {{to the people in}} the market-place, representing to them the hardships which they endured by the oppressions of the nobility, and urging them to combine together to petition the king for a redress of their grievances. [...] "The king will <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> I am sure," [...] said he, [...] "if we go to him together in a body and make our request; but if he will not hear us, then we must redress our grievances ourselves the best way we can." ...|$|E
