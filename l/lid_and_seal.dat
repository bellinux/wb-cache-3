50|$|When {{the fish}} are hung over the fire, {{the top of the}} barrel is covered with a <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealed</b> around the edges with wet jute sacks (the water {{prevents}} the jute sacks from catching fire). All of this serves to create a very hot, humid and smoky fire. The intense heat and thick smoke is essential if {{the fish are}} to be cooked, not burned, and to have the strong, smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies. Typically {{in less than an hour}} of smoking, the fish are ready to eat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we present}} a robust and {{adaptable}} technique to integrate microfluidics with an on-chip thiolate monolayer-protected gold nanoparticle coated chemiresistor array for vapor analyte detection in a micro-scale gas chromatograph (IlGC). The process involves mounting a sensing chip and capillary tubes within a silicon "extension carrier " (EC), capping the chemiresistor-array with a glass <b>lid,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> the micro fluidic package with non-sorbent epoxy. The stability and efficacy of the integrated detector cell is elucidated by consistent chip responses induced by the diffusion of vapor analytes though the detector cell.

25|$|A very {{different}} method of popcorn-making {{can still be}} seen on the streets of some Chinese cities and Korea today. The un-popped corn kernels are poured into a large cast-iron canister — sometimes called a 'popcorn hammer' — that is then sealed with a heavy <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> slowly turned over a curbside fire in rotisserie fashion. When a pressure gauge on the canister reaches a certain level, the canister is removed from the fire, a large canvas sack is put over the <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> the <b>seal</b> is released. With a huge boom, all of the popcorn explodes at once and is poured into the sack. This method {{is believed to have been}} developed, during the Song dynasty, originally for puffing rice.|$|R
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet assembly handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer <b>lid</b> removal, <b>and</b> inner shield plug lifting fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask <b>lid(s)</b> is removed, <b>and</b> the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack <b>and</b> the DPC <b>lid</b> is severed <b>and</b> removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> temporary <b>sealing</b> device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner <b>lid</b> <b>and</b> temporary <b>sealing</b> device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation <b>and</b> decontamination area, <b>lids</b> are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading <b>and</b> subsequently <b>seals</b> the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper was carried out as an ESTEC Development Contract to study die attachment, wire bonding and packaging of gallium arsenide devices. A low mass and volume hermetic package suitable for single or multichip packaging was identified, and the mounting and wire bonding carried out within this package. The obiective of this work was to evaluate conductive epoxy resin die mounting <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> <b>sealing,</b> compare it with eutectic methods and to find if reliable thermosonic bonds {{could be made to}} devices without damaging the underlying material. All test pieces were subjected to long term high temperature storage, environmental or mechanical stress. Bond strengths and visual appearance were examined before and after stress testing together with particular requirements such as hermeticity of sealed packages. It was found that devices could be satisfactorily mounted in the packages using conductive epoxy resins, reliable thermosonic bonds made to the die without damaging the underlying material, and the package hermetically sealed using a conductive epoxy resin...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} <b>and</b> heat <b>sealing</b> of <b>lidding</b> films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat <b>sealing</b> <b>and</b> the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes <b>and</b> prevent leak-proof <b>sealing.</b> Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the <b>sealing</b> area, <b>and</b> to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof <b>sealing</b> <b>and</b> must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, <b>and</b> the <b>sealing</b> pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays <b>and</b> multi-layer polymer <b>lidding</b> films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> <b>sealing</b> process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R
40|$|Reliability of plated {{packages}} after post plating processing steps such as die attach, glass bonding, <b>and</b> <b>lid</b> <b>sealing</b> can be {{a critical}} problem causing poor wetting of solder and loss of hermeticity. We have explored three different approaches to obtaining higher reliability gold platings on nickelhungsten and titanium metallization. These approaches included alloying of nickel and gold, alloying of nickel and cobalt, and discrete barrier layers of palladium or platinum. All three approaches show significant improvement in solder sealing after processing temperatures of 500 °C. Of these approaches, electroless palladium or platinum and gold coatings showed superior performance. Critical IO the implementation of this approach was {{the development of a}} truly autocatalytic electroless gold process for plating on palladium and nickel. Details of this plating composition will be given along with experiments measuring the effect of bath constituents on the activity of selected reducing agents. Experiments with titanium metallized ceramics were conducted with titanium deposited from a molten salt. A brief description of this process will be included. The process of intermetallic diffusion {{has been shown to be}} a critical problem in many aspects of microelectronics devices and packaging. [l-IO] The thin film thicknesses used in th...|$|R
