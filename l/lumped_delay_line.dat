40|$|The LHC {{injection}} kicker {{is made by}} a <b>lumped</b> element <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> using capacitors {{and single}} turn inductors. For these inductors different types of ferrites (Philips 8 C 11 and 4 A 4) are considered. At the time when this report was written only 4 A 4 ferrite was available for a prototype kicker construction, {{as well as for}} impedance measurements by the wire method. The 4 A 4 ferrite comes in standard blocks (42 x 54 x 74 mm) which are quite expensive, so there were virtually no spare blocks available which could be machined for use in the standard coaxial technique. Thus we have developed a strip-line test jig which permits testing material parameters on existing ferrite blocks without additional (destructive) machining. Special aspects, advantages and difficulties of this method are discussed. The bench measurements and also theoretical and numerical estimates of the beam coupling impedance of the kickers are under way...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major Pro essor) The extremely fast ionization {{process in}} semiconductors offers {{a means of}} generating pulses that have sub-nanosecond rise times and high peak powers. There are several important applications of these pulses which require {{the duration of the}} generated pulse to be variable. This thesis investigates three methods of producing variable-width pulses using transistors operating in the avalanche mode. The first circuit studied is used with a capacitor as the collector load. It produces pulse rise times of less than one nanosecond but has the disadvantage of a relatively slow RC discharge fall time. Distributed and <b>lumped</b> parameter <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> were used in the second form of circuits studied. With the artificial <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> the pulse width can be controlled by opening the line at different sections whereas with the cable, the length must be altered to change the pulse width. These circuits produced fast rise, flat top, and fast fall pulses. In the third method studied, a composite circuit is used in which the fast rise of an avalanche pulse is added to a slower rise, but variable duration pulse, generated by a saturating transistor. This method is shown to produce fast rise, variable-width pulses with overshoot and ringing easily held to less than five percent...|$|R

40|$|Firstly, {{the basic}} {{theory of the}} optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is reviewed. Optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is one of important parts in OCT. Several types of optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> which were proposed and demonstrated are briefly described including their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a novel multiple-pass cavity optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> (MPC-ODL) is proposed and analyzed. The proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> consists of four mirrors, one lens and one resonant scanner. In this proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> the path <b>delay</b> is obtained by scanning a tilting mirror and magnified by the multiple-pass optical cavity. Thus, for a small scanning angle, a large path delay can be obtained. This <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is especially suitable for the OCT system that will generate the large dimension images at video rate with high resolution. However, due to multiple-pass cavity used in the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> false interference signal may be created besides OCT signal. In {{order to reduce the}} false interference signal generation, some crucial parameters of the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> have to be carefully chosen. Principle of how to choose the optical component parameters is given. The proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> combined with OCT is verified by computer simulation. Characterization of the <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is done by simulation and it is shown that the scanning repetition rate of 16 kHz, the total path delay of 3 mm, and the scan velocity of 71. 3 m/s can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract — Optical queues, usually {{constructed}} by optical Switches and fiber <b>Delay</b> <b>Lines</b> (SDL), {{are the key}} elements for conflict resolution in optical packet switching. It is recently shown in [3] that several optical queues {{constructed by}} SDL elements are indeed infinite dimensional switches in time {{and they can be}} constructed by many classical constructions in the switching theory. In particular, a (unicast) flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> in [3] is a discrete-time infinite-server queue that corresponds to the nonblocking switch in the switching theory, and it can be constructed either by the three-stage Clos network or the Cantor network. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> that use the unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> as the basic construction elements. The first one is constructed by using parallel unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> It is shown that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d can be constructed by using O (√ d) unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d. Our second construction is a recursive construction. We show that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> 2 d− 1 can be constructed by two unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d − 1 and a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d− 1. As an application, we show that multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> can be used for the constructions of optical multicast switches with 100 % throughput. I...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two main}} issues with {{conventional}} CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> The first issue is the jitter performance {{which is in the}} range of several picoseconds (Klepacki et al. 2014; Xanthopoulos 2009). Although the jitter performance is not as fine as that of optical-based <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> extensive work to produce sub-picosecond jitter performance CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> is actively undertaken by many parties {{due to the fact that}} IC-based <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are robust in terms of system integration and cost reduction when compared to their optical counterpart. The second issue is in realizing a long delay range that is linear with high-resolution delay steps simultaneously (Xanthopoulos 2009). Fine-resolution CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> cannot simply be cascaded like optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> because <b>delay</b> increments are non-linear mainly due to the complex nature of the parasitic capacitance network in the delay elements of the <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> The cascading methodology also leads to a complex PCB implementation. Thus, a single chip solution should be developed to overcome these shortcomings.|$|R
