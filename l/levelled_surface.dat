The other end being tied round Peters' waist, I lowered him down {{over the edge of the}} precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the <b>levelled</b> <b>surface.</b> I then drew him up for about four feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to Peters' ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.|$|E

40|$|Precast Prestressed Hollow Core Slabs (PPHCS) {{are most}} {{commonly}} used as flooring and roofing elements. Usually, a new layer of concrete {{is placed on the}} top of hollow core slabs to create a continuous and <b>levelled</b> <b>surface.</b> The common thickness of this bonded overlay will be around 50 mm to 75 mm deep. The provision of Bonded Overlay (BO) will increase the cracking load and flexural strength of hollow core slab after the full composite action is developed. In the present study, the effect of shear keys at the interface of bonded overlay and hollow core slab is studied. The hollow core slab and bonded overlay is expected to have a full composite action until failure without any interface separation. The dimension of hollow core used in this investigation is 600 mm wide, 150 mm depth and 3500 mm length. In total, three full-scale hollow core slabs were tested under shear span (a) to depth (d) ratio of 7. 5. The three specimens which include un-strengthened slab denoted as control slab, slab strengthened with bonded overlay without any shear keys at the interface and bonded overlay with shear keys. Bonded overlay specimens without shear keys resulted in interfacial failure and it was able to increase the peak load by 38. 4 % compared to the control specimen. However, the bonded overlay with shear keys resulted in full composite action till the final failure and it was able to increase the peak load by 59. 6 % compared to the control specimen. The provision of shear keys at the interface of hollow core slabs and bonded overlay resulted in full composite action...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new Eulerian tool to study {{complicated}} dynamical systems {{based on the}} average growth in the surface area {{of a family of}} <b>level</b> <b>surfaces</b> represented implicitly by a level set function. Since this proposed quantity determines the temporal variation of the averaged surface area of all <b>level</b> <b>surfaces,</b> we name the quantity the Variation of the Integral over Area of <b>Level</b> <b>Surfaces</b> (VIALS). Numerically, all these infinitely many <b>level</b> <b>surfaces</b> are advected according to the given dynamics by solving one single linear advection equation. To develop a computationally efficient approach, we apply the coarea formula and rewrite the surface area integral as a simple integral relating the total variation (TV) of the level set function. The proposed method can be easily incorporated with a recent Eulerian algorithm for efficient computation of flow maps to speed up our approach. We will also prove that the proposed VIALS is closely related to the computation of the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) in the Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) extraction. This connects our proposed Eulerian approach to widely used Lagrangian techniques for understanding complicated dynamical systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
