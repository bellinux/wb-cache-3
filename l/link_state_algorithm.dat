40|$|We {{describe}} and analyze a new communication-efficient routing algorithm for packet forwarding networks {{such as the}} Internet. The explicit design objective of our routing algorithm, called XL, {{is to reduce the}} communication overhead of routing, allowing the routing algorithm to support larger networks without resorting to artificial network partitioning techniques such as OSPF areas. We achieve this by allowing suboptimal forwarding paths up to a user-specified stretch factor. (By setting stretch to 1 it is also possible to force optimal routing.) The XL routing algorithm is a <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithm,</b> meaning that network nodes disseminate information about the state of links in the network. The essential difference between XL and the classical <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithm</b> used by OSPF and IS -IS is in the semantics of link state updates: in the classical algorithm, a link state update specifies the exact link cost, while in XL it specifies an upper bound on the actual cost. This allows XL to suppress updates when the route cost do not decrease significantly. In addition to the formal specification and correctness proof, we also compare XL to four existing routing algorithms in simulation. Two of these algorithms are the classical distance vector algorithm and the <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithm</b> which are the basis of the RIP and OSPF routing protocols, respectively. The other two are state-of-the art experimental protocols: distance vector with parent pointer, and the link vector algorithm, both based on the idea of restricting updates to those about links in a node's shortest-path tree. Experimental results show that our algorithm consistently generates fewer updates in response to network changes, in some cases by nearly an order of magnitud...|$|E

40|$|Network Working GroupNetwork Working GroupThis {{document}} {{describes the}} Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization {{of the classical}} <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithm</b> tailored {{to the requirements of}} a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithm,</b> partial link state information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context...|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods have}} {{recently}} been proposed to improve <b>link</b> <b>state</b> protocol efficiency within wireless ad hoc networks. One class of approaches targets the reduction of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> control overhead that contributes to networkwide broadcast storms, therefore enhancing protocol scalability. We have implemented and studied two such methods and demonstrate and discuss their relative performance characteristics. We present early simulation analysis {{over a number of}} scalability factors, including average nodal density and network diameter (maximum path length). Based upon initial results, we demonstrate that the two approaches to <b>link</b> <b>state</b> overhead reduction are somewhat complementary and that they provide additional benefit when applied together in many topologies studied. While both approaches are valid scalable flooding techniques, we discuss further the relative merits and potential disadvantages of each technique. BACKGROUND There has been recent interest in improving the scalability and operation of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> routing mechanisms in wireless ad hoc networks [CM 99]. While applying a hierarchy can reduce protocol overhead through state aggregation, several methods recently proposed reduce classical <b>link</b> <b>state</b> overhead requirements without hierarchies. Classical flooding techniques often used for distributing <b>link</b> <b>state</b> amongst the network nodes contribute significant protocol overhead and traffic congestion as the network scales, especially when applied in wireless networks [SRS 02]. We define classical flooding to be the case in which each node throughout the network rebroadcasts the data packet once and only once. In recent years, more routing control flooding improvements for mobile ad hoc networks (manet) have been proposed and there has been some evaluation of their relative merits [HXG 02]. We have chosen to model and analyze some detailed scalability aspects of two recent innovative approaches that address problem of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> flooding in different ways. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two such methods used to reduce control flooding overhead for <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>algorithms.</b> Th...|$|R

40|$|The routing {{strategy}} {{is an important}} issue in Vehicular ad hoc Networks since the shared nature of the wireless medium, the time-varying capacity of the links and the highly dynamic network topology due to vehicle’s mobility severely restrict the choices available for the creation of the paths. These issues influence the availability of the path and its long-term duration. In this report we present a performance analysis of XOR 1 -based flat routing protocols in high mobility conditions, considering a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) formed in a highway scenario. First, we propose an XOR-based protocol that incorporates several adaptations of the existing XOR-based routing algorithms, in order to cope with the network mobility. Then we propose an improved version of it, XORi, which modifies the protocol’s information gathering process to accommodate the specific dynamic nature of VANETs topology. Finally, we evaluate the performance of XOR-based protocols with other topology-based routing protocols. Simulation results allow us to characterize the performance of this class of protocols through the comparison of the packet delivery ratio, end-to-end path delay and average number of path hops 2.
