25|$|The villa {{consists}} of two areas, the oldest around the peristyle which was built around the first century BC and the later part, probably widening or merging of an existing structure, {{dating back to the}} imperial age. The peristyle has a portico on three sides and different areas including a oecus (lost following a landslide), and several scenic areas that <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the sea. On the west side there is a square fish pond with lead pipes and water spouts. The south side is a pseudo-portico adorned with columns resting on a wall, behind which lies the baths that includes a caldarium with a bathtub, a tepidarium also with tub and garden and a laconicum with domed roof and a kitchen. On the north side next to Ariana Villa are a triclinium, a cubiculum.|$|E
2500|$|Forty years later, Barbatos is {{released}} {{and allowed to}} return to Hell. [...] Once free, the demon discovers the true nature of Tim's apparent defeat: the boy had hidden his soul inside the memory Barbatos took and once inside the demon it slept, slowly taking complete control of Barbatos' body until Tim owned it completely, remodeling it with his magic to resemble his own body at the age of fourteen. [...] As he took complete control, Tim <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the Other's ruined home, finally grown-up and ready to face whatever challenges the future held with [...] "no more whining".|$|E
2500|$|Existing {{documents}} do not {{record the}} reason or {{chain of events}} surrounding {{the opening of the}} Port of Kobe instead of the Port of Hyōgo. Still, {{there are a number of}} theories. In Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu, Toshio Kusumoto guesses that the shogunate, mindful of the population's preference to keep foreigners at a distance and wishing to avoid conflict, wanted to avoid opening the already bustling and prosperous port of Hyōgo. Meanwhile, [...] and Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu both conjecture that it was easier to secure a site in the less densely populated area around Kōbe-mura, and this site also allowed the reappropriation of the Kobe Naval Training Center, which had shut down in 1865. A November 1865 survey of the surrounding ocean by an attendant of the British envoy Harry Smith Parkes indicated that the area intended for the foreign settlement, somewhat removed from the old Hyōgo town center, <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a small bay that was sufficiently deep and provided an anchorage abundant in nature. Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu posits from this that this site was Kōbe-mura, and that the foreign powers also found this location more suitable than the existing port of Hyōgo. In any case, in 1892, the port of Kobe was expanded to incorporate the old port of Hyōgo.|$|E
