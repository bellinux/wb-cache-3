40|$|In this work, {{a compact}} {{mathematical}} {{representation of the}} time-dependent breakdown dynamics of heavy ion irradiated thin oxides subjected to electrical stress is investigated. The model is formulated as a stochastic differential equation for the gate leakage current consisting of a deterministic term and two random terms. The first one deals with the short transient and evolution toward the steady state conduction level after the triggering of the breakdown event, the second one simulates the noisy behavior between the arrival of events and the third term represents the opening of successive breakdown paths across the dielectric film. Ion hits are assumed to cause {{a finite number of}} <b>latent</b> <b>damaged</b> sites distributed throughout the oxide area, which manifest, as the electrical stress proceeds, in the long-run saturating behavior of the current-time characteristics. A non-homogeneous Poisson counting process is used to describe the switching from latent to active spot while a gaussian process is considered for the low-level fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Progressive failure {{behaviour}} of laminated composite skewed hypar shells is {{investigated in}} this paper through finite element approach. For composite materials which are weak in transverse shear, failure may initiate at any inner lamina or interface and may remain undetected and unattended to. Such <b>latent</b> <b>damages</b> may progress gradually and lead to a sudden total ply failure. An iterative method is adopted using the various failure theories to predict the first ply failure load. After the first ply failure, the stiffness of the failed element is totally discarded from the laminate and the remaining laminate is considered for further analysis. The developed finite element code is validated through solution of a benchmark problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to obtain the first ply and progressive failure of simply supported hypar shells under transverse distributed load. While obtaining the failure loads, the shell {{is considered to be}} under plane stress condition and in linear elastic range. Results are studied meticulously to extract a set of conclusions of practical significance regarding the failure characteristics of composite hypar shells...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{restrictions}} to the employment of the track-etch neutron radiography technique, is the low-intrinsic optical contrast achieved in the recorded image {{that leads to a}} poor sensitivity to discern thickness changes of the materials. The sensitivity is determined by measuring the light transmitted through the images and for such purpose, conventional analog optical microphotometers are typically employed. In the present work a digital system has been employed to measure the light transmitted and a significant improvement in the sensitivity was achieved. The use of solid state nuclear track detectors(SSNTD) to record neutron radiography(NR) images is a well known technique. The radiography is obtained by irradiating a sample in an uniform neutron beam and a converter screen transforms the transmitted neutron intensity into ionizing radiation which is able to cause damages into the detector. Usually boron based converter screens are used, and in which case, alpha particles and lithium ions cause the damages. By means of a chemical etching the <b>latent</b> <b>damages</b> are enlarged and are called tracks and, they form a two-dimensional image which is visible by the naked eye. The insensitivity of the SSNTD to visible light, beta and gamma radiations, the high resolution achieved in the image, the feasibility of stopping the development at intermediate stages are some of their attractive characteristics for radiograph...|$|R
40|$|Interlaminar and intralaminar {{failure modes}} of {{composite}} conoidal shells are investigated {{in this paper}} using finite element as the mathematical tool. One of the prerequisites for confidently applying the composite shells in practical civil engineering {{is to have a}} comprehensive idea about the shell behavior under different loading conditions. The static bending and free vibration responses of laminated composite conoidal shells are now well known as a good number of technical papers have been published by different researchers. But for these materials which are weak in transverse shear failure may initiate at any inner lamina or interface and may remain undetected and unattended. Such <b>latent</b> <b>damages</b> may progress gradually and lead to a sudden total ply failure. Due to fabrication problems or overloading, delamination defect may occur and remain hidden within the lamina. Hence it is imperative to have knowledge of the first ply failure load and the load at which delamination initiates. To explore this area, in this paper, a simply supported shell is considered loaded by concentrated load. Lamination and the load position are varied to investigate the first ply failure characteristics of the composite shell. Well accepted failure theories like maximum stress, Hoffman, Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill are used in the current formulation to obtain failure loads. While obtaining the failure loads, each lamina is considered to be under plane stress condition i. e. no transverse stresses are considered to act on any lamina. Comparison of failure loads obtained from both the failure modes are also presented to get the minimum failure load which will govern the shell design...|$|R

Response of the rat erythrocyte to ozone was monitored with red blood cell potassium (rubidium) influx studies, with storage stress combined with ultrastructural studies and with levels of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Erythrocytes of rats exposed to O 3 showed no significant changes either in their potassium influx or in their glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities compared to controls. Erythrocyte differential counts on O 3 -exposed animals showed significant changes initially as well as following storage stress compared to controls.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that populations exposed to chronic levels of genotoxins for many generations in situ will accumulate <b>latent</b> heritable genetic <b>damage</b> leading {{to increases in}} mutational load and decreased population fitness. Common pulmonate snails (Lymnaea stagnalis) were collected from three sites that differed in pollution level [Manitoulin Island (reference), Beauharnois (moderate pollution), and Varennes (highly polluted) ]. These organisms have a rapid generation time and are capable of self-fertilization. Fitness indicators were clutch size, survival (hatching to day 30) and growth (length from hatching to day 90). Recessive deleterious mutations that have accumulated through time are masked as snails preferentially outcrossed, but are expressed when snails self-fertilize. Results obtained by comparing fitness components of snails derived from selfing and outcrossing experiments showed that in sites {{with higher levels of}} pollution inbreeding depression increased for clutch size and survival. Results for growth rate were similar to those for clutch size and survival in the two least polluted sites, but not for the most polluted site, due possibly to biased mortality of smaller snails at this site. After correction for size biased mortality, the growth estimates showed patterns similar for the two polluted sites when compared to the reference site. This study suggests that long-term in situ exposure to genotoxic pollution may effect population fitness due to the accumulation of <b>latent</b> heritable genetic <b>damage...</b>|$|R

The presence of IR was assessed by homeostasis model assessment ratio, and the serum level of heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) was measured as a maker of silent and ongoing myocardial damage.

30|$|This section {{demonstrates}} the dynamic data-driven adaptation from incomplete sensor samples on {{a model of}} a bending plate. The <b>latent</b> parameter describes <b>damage</b> of the plate. The damage is a local decrease of the thickness of the plate. The model is based on the Mindlin plate theory [23, 47] that takes into account transverse shear deformations but neglects important nonlinear effects such as postbuckling behavior. Therefore, the model that we use in this section is a simple description of a plate in bending. We use the plate model only to provide a proof of concept of our adaptation approach. More advanced plate models are used in real-world engineering applications. We refer to “Summary and future work” section for a discussion on further applications of our adaptation approach.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible role of secretory granules in radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction, rats were pretreated with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to degranulate salivary gland acini, At maximal depletion, salivary glands were locally irradiated {{with a single}} dose of 15 Gy of X rays. Parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva samples were collected before and 1 - 10 days after irradiation, The lag phase, flow rate, concentrations of potassium and sodium, and amylase secretion were determined. Sham-treated, isoproterenol-treated and irradiated animals provided reference data. In the parotid gland, {{but not in the}} submandibular gland, protection against radiation-induced changes in flow rate and composition of saliva occurred after pretreatment with isoproterenol. Combining morphological data from a previous study with data from the current study, it is suggested that improvement of parotid gland function is attributed predominantly to a proliferative stimulus on acinar cells by isoproterenol and not to its degranulation effect, After pretreatment with isoproterenol, an earlier expression of radiation-induced acinar cell damage leading to death was observed, followed by a faster tissue recovery, Thus the proliferative stimulus on acinar cells may accelerate the unmasking of <b>latent</b> lethal <b>damage,</b> resulting in the earlier replacement of dead cells by new, functionally intact cells.

Aim {{of the study was}} to measure serum levels of Cyst C, as well as IL- 8 and CRP, in otherwise healthy OSAS patients. Methods. 84 individuals examined with polysomnography for OSAS symptoms without known comorbidities were prospectively recruited. Results. According to apnea hypopnea index (AHI) subjects were divided in two groups: OSAS group (AHI > 5 /hour, n= 64) and controls (AHI < 5 /hour, n= 20), which were age- and BMI-matched. Cyst C levels were higher in OSAS patients versus controls (1176. 13 ± 351. 33 versus 938. 60 ± 245. 83 [*]ng/mL, resp.; p= 0. 017) while serum IL- 8 and CRP levels did not differ significantly. Positive correlation was found between Cyst C levels and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) (r= 0. 240, p= 0. 039) and percentage of time with oxygen saturation < 90 % (r= 0. 290, p= 0. 02) and negative correlation was found between Cyst C levels and average oxygen saturation during sleep (r=- 0. 291, p= 0. 012).

In this work, we investigated the impact of latent plasma induced damage on the reliability of nMOSFETs with small gate area and gate oxide thickness of 3. 2 nm. To this purpose, we stressed 1, 500 devices with different antenna areas by using a staircase-like stress voltage, and by monitoring the gate leakage at the gate voltage VG= 2 V. The stress was always stopped because of an abrupt jump in the gate current. The statistics obtained for the breakdown current is characterized by two different oxide breakdown modes. The first is the well-known HardBreakdown, while the second one, which we called Micro Breakdown, can be modeled as a Double Trap Assisted Tunneling mechanism, and is characterized by a very small leakage current (around 100 pA at the gate voltage VG= 2 V). In devices with large antenna, i. e., more prone to be damaged by plasma processing, the number of micro broken oxides is larger and breakdown occurs at lower voltages than in reference devices (non plasma damaged). For converse, the Hard Breakdown statistics shows only a weak dependence on the gate antenna ratio of plasma damaged devices. This has been explained by considering the intrinsic nature of latent plasma-induced oxide defects, linkedto the different generation mechanisms involved in Micro Breakdown and Hard Breakdown phenomena...|$|E

The shrinking size of semiconductor circuits, thinner gate oxides, complex chips with multiple power supplies and mixed-signal blocks, larger chip capacitance and faster circuit operation, all contribute to increased ESD sensitivity of advanced semiconductor devices. Therefore, understanding and controlling ESD is indispensable for higher quality and reliability of advanced device technologies. 	This thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of ESD and EOS failures in GaAs and SiGe devices. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, characteristics of internal damage caused by several ESD test models and EOS stress in non-silicon devices (GaAs and SiGe) are identified. Failure signatures are correlated with field failures using various failure analysis techniques. 	The second part of this thesis discusses the effects of ESD <b>latent</b> <b>damage</b> in GaAs devices. Depending on the stress level, ESD voltage can causes latent failures if the device is repeatedly stressed under low ESD voltage conditions, and can cause premature damage leading eventually to catastrophic failures. Electrical degradation due to ESD-induced <b>latent</b> <b>damage</b> in GaAs MESFETs after cumulative low-level ESD stress is studied. Using failure analysis, combined with electrical characterization, the failure modes and signatures of EOS stressed devices with and without prior low-level ESD stress are compared. 	To predict the power-to-failure level of GaAs and silicon devices, an ESD failure model using a thermal RC network was developed. A correlation method of the real ESD stress and square wave pulse has been developed. The equivalent duration of the square pulse is calculated and proposed for the HBM ESD stress.

Untreated early syphilis infections results in a high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, including saddle nose, lower extremity abnormalities, miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths, or death in newborns. Some infants with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth, but many develop symptoms later. Babies exposed, in utero, can have deformities, delays in development, or seizures along with many other problems such as rash, fever, an enlarged liver and spleen, anemia, and jaundice. Newborns will typically not develop a primary syphilitic chancre, but may present with signs of secondary syphilis (i.e. generalized body rash). Often these babies will develop syphilitic rhinitis ("snuffles"), the mucus from which is laden with the T. pallidum bacterium, and therefore highly infectious.

40|$|Background: Recent studies {{reported}} that cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), i. e. small areas of signal loss on T 2 *-weighted gradient-echo (GE) imaging, could develop rapidly after acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that CMBs rapidly emerge after carotid artery stenting (CAS). Objective: We investigated {{the frequency of}} and predisposing factors for CMBs after CAS. Methods: We retrospectively examined MRI before and after CAS in 88 consecutive patients (average age: 71. 7 ± 7. 2 years, average rates of carotid stenosis: 72. 6 ± 12. 8 %) who underwent CAS for carotid artery stenosis between March 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010. We defined new CMBs as signal losses that newly appeared on the follow-up GE. We examined the association of new CMBs with demographics, risk factors, and baseline MBs. Results: Among 88 patients, 18 (20. 5 %) had CMBs initially, and 7 (8. 0 %) developed new CMBs right after CAS. New CMBs appeared {{on the same side}} of CAS in all of the 7 patients. New CMBs appeared significantly more frequently in the CMB-positive group than in the CMB-negative one (22 % vs. 4 %, p = 0. 03) on the pre-CAS MRI. Multivariate analysis also revealed that the presence of CMBs before CAS was an independent predictor of new development of CMBs after CAS (odds ratio: 8. 09, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 39 – 47. 1). Conclusion: CMBs can develop rapidly after CAS, especially in patients with pre-existing CMBs. Since the existence of CMBs prior to CAS suggests a <b>latent</b> vascular <b>damage</b> which is vulnerable to hemodynamic stress following CAS, particular attention should be paid to the prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage due to hyperperfusion after CAS...|$|R
