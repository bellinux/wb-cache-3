Work it was; for every <b>lease</b> granted <b>by</b> my grandfather having run out, the tenants had remained on their farms <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> or as occupants at will, holding {{from year to}} year under parole agreements made with Mr. Newcome, who had authority to go that far, but no farther.|$|R

60|$|The {{family and}} {{descendants}} of Dugald Ciar Mhor lived chiefly {{in the mountains}} between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, and occupied {{a good deal of}} property there--whether <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> <b>by</b> the right of the sword, which it was never safe to dispute with them, or by legal titles of various kinds, it would be useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail. Enough;--there they certainly were--a people whom their most powerful neighbours were desirous to conciliate, their friendship in peace being very necessary to the quiet of the vicinage, and their assistance in war equally prompt and effectual.|$|R
60|$|I {{trust it}} is hardly {{necessary}} to specify my knowledge that when I speak of 'the state of my own views' on this question, I do so not of right but <b>by</b> <b>sufferance,</b> <b>by</b> invitation from you, by that more than parental kindness and indulgence with which I have ever met at my parents' hands, which {{it would be as}} absurd to make a matter of formal acknowledgment as {{it would be impossible to}} repay, and for which I can only say, and I say it from the bottom of my heart, may God reward them with his best and choicest gifts, eternal, unfading in the heavens.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the effect}} of a city {{ordinance}} which proposes to a public utility company the terms on which it may dispose of its product to the users, but which is rejected by the company? As to a company not yet doing business {{it is clear that the}} ordinance when rejected becomes a mere legal nullity. It never was more than an offer that might ripen into a binding contract by acceptance. That it is by no means a nullity as to a utility actually operating in the city after the expiration of its franchise and as a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets, is held in City and County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. Supreme Court of the U. S. Nos. 294 and 295, decided March 4, 1918. The city of Denver may well be surprised to learn that by passing an ordinance which the company rejected it was considerably worse off than if it had done nothing. In effect, by passing an ordinance fixing the maximum charges permitted to be made by the company 2 ̆ 2 during the time it shall further act as a water carrier and tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of said streets 2 ̆ 2, the city gave to the plant a value that made the rates illegal and defeated the ordinance. That any unaccepted ordinance should have such an effect is indeed startling, the more so that in this case the city was careful to expressly recite in the preamble that the company had for four years been without a franchise and a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets and that this enactment was made without recognizing the right of the company to occupy the streets or to continue its service...|$|R
