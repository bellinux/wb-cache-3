5|$|In neuroscience, <b>long-term</b> <b>potentiation</b> (LTP) is a {{persistent}} strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing <b>long-term</b> <b>potentiations</b> (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP.

40|$|Despite vast {{research}} efforts since Cajal 2 ̆ 7 s seminal {{thoughts on the}} adaptation of the nervous system, researchers have only recently begun to understand the diversity of forms of neuronal plasticity and its mechanisms. All known forms of activity-dependent neuronal plasticity utilize alterations in [Ca 2 +]i as a signal {{of changes in the}} membrane voltage. Ca 2 + sensors trigger modifications in excitability or synaptic strength that last from seconds to weeks and presumably years. Intriguingly, Kunjilwar et al., (unpublished observations) discovered in peripheral sensory axons of Aplysia that the induction of depolarization-dependent long-term axonal hyperexcitability does not require Ca 2 + transients. Here we show that induction of depolarization-dependent intermediate-term and <b>long-term</b> synaptic <b>potentiation</b> in Aplysia occurs in conditions that prevent Ca 2 + entry through voltage-gated channels and elevation of [Ca 2 +]i. We found that the intermediate-term synaptic potentiation induced under conditions expected to prevent Ca 2 + transients is associated with increased excitability of sensory neuron axons near presynaptic terminals, suggesting that the synaptic potentiation involves a presynaptic locus. The Ca 2 +-independent intermediate- and <b>long-term</b> synaptic <b>potentiation</b> appeared similar to previously reported Ca 2 +-dependent modifications in Aplysia. ...|$|R
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology.

40|$|In the cortex, homeostatic {{plasticity}} {{appears to}} be a key process for maintaining neuronal network activity in a functional range. This phenomenon depends on close interactions between excitatory and inhibitory circuits. We previously showed that application of a high frequency of stimulation (HFS) protocol in layer 2 / 3 induces parallel potentiation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on layer 5 pyramidal neurons, leading to an unchanged excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. These coordinated <b>long-term</b> <b>potentiations</b> of excitation and inhibition correspond to homeostatic plasticity of the neuronal networks. We showed here, on the rat visual cortex, that blockade (with gabazine) or overactivation (with 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol) of GABA(A) receptors enhanced the E/I balance and prevented the potentiation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs after an HFS protocol. These impairements of the GABAergic transmission led to a long-term depression-like effect after an HFS protocol. We also observed that the blockade of inhibition reduced excitation (by 60 %), and conversely, the blockade of excitation decreased inhibition (by 90 %). These results support the idea that inhibitory interneurons are critical for recurrent interactions underlying homeostatic plasticity in cortical networks...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{entering}} the cell via different routes, e. g.,N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), plays {{a pivotal role}} in hippocampal synaptic potentiation. Since corticosteroid hormones have been reported to enhance calcium influx through VDCCs, one may predict that these hormones facilitate hippocampal synaptic efficacy. Surprisingly, though, stress and corticosteroids have so far been found to reduce synaptic potentiation. Here, we addressed this apparent paradox and examined synaptic potentiation in the CA 1 area of hippocampal slices from mice with low basal corticosterone levels 1 - 4 h after a brief in vitro administration of corticosterone. Nifedipine and APV were used to isolate NMDA receptor-mediated and VDCC-mediated <b>long-term</b> <b>potentiations</b> (LTPs), respectively. We report that corticosterone facilitates synaptic potentiation that depends on activation of VDCCs while impairing synaptic plasticity that is mediated by NMDA receptor activation. The glucocorticoid-receptor (GR) antagonist RU 38486 blocked both the effects of corticosterone. These results indicate that the net effect of corticosteroid hormones on synaptic plasticity is determined by the balance between different types of potentiation, a balance that may be region specific and depends on the experimental conditions. We speculate that these opposite effects on synaptic efficacy are involved in the bidirectional modulation of cognitive performance by corticosteroid hormones. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|R

Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of <b>long-term</b> <b>potentiation,</b> and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E

On average, about 60 % of LTP can be accounted for by presynaptic enhancement.
