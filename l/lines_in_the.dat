5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats. By the Depression-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line {{became one of the}} first inland steamship companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means of filling its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw and diagonal <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prismatic}} joint, or slider, {{requires that}} a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moving body remain co-linear with a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fixed body, and a plane parallel to this <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moving body maintain {{contact with a}} similar parallel plane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom.|$|R

5|$|The stellar {{temperature}} {{will determine}} the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spectrum.

5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} is given {{multiple}} {{options to choose}} from, and text progression pauses at these points until a decision is made. These decisions determine the sequence in which the story's events will occur, and progress the plot toward a specific heroine's ending. There are four main plot <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original Windows version that the player will {{have the chance to}} experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. This is increased to five plot <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Xbox 360 version with the extended scenario for Nue. In order to view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions.|$|E
5|$|A {{branch office}} of PreCheck Inc., a company {{performing}} background checks of health-care workers, opened in 2006. PreCheck received $2.4 million in high-wage job creation tax credits, $1.5 million in job-training subsidies, $1.5 million in capital outlay money for roads and infrastructure, a $625,000 allocation from City of Alamogordo for upgrading sewer <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and 20.8 aces of land from Heritage Group, a developer.|$|E
50|$|The {{branch lines}} {{began to be}} closed from the late 1940s, the Wensleydale <b>line</b> being <b>the</b> first <b>in</b> 1948, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> Forrest <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1957, <b>the</b> Irrewarra <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1953, <b>the</b> Alvie <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1954, <b>the</b> Beech Forest <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1962 (<b>the</b> section from Weeaproniah to Crowes having been closed <b>in</b> 1954), and <b>the</b> Timboon <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1988.|$|R

5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd {{a few yards}} apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stationsâ€”one at {{each end}} of the tunnelâ€”the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Shanghai flooded 84city streets; in some locations insufficient {{water drainage}} left homes and apartments flooded, {{with a total}} of 20,000houses reporting flooding. The flooding also closed the city subway system for a few hours. Strong winds downed 2,700 trees and 400 power <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city, leaving three injured and one person killed. Throughout the city an estimated 15,000houses were destroyed. Additionally, four people were electrocuted {{as a result of the}} flooding. In Shanghai alone, damage totaled $1.33billion (2005CNY, $164.5million 2005USD); seven people died in the city.|$|E
5|$|HiÊ»iaka is {{the outer}} and, at roughly 350km in diameter, the larger and {{brighter}} {{of the two}} moons. Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 Âµm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface. The unusual spectrum, and its similarity to absorption <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spectrum of Haumea, led Brown and colleagues to conclude that {{it was unlikely that}} the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects into orbit around the dwarf planet: instead, the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} along its path through Baja California Sur. At least 85 homes in La Paz sustained damage, and many telephone <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region were {{down at the}} height of the storm. Wind gusts estimated at 120mph (195km/h) swept through San JosÃ© del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite the damage, no deaths were reported in the wake of Paul.|$|E
