5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender <b>locos,</b> the only tender <b>locos</b> to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated head-on collision. Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 the L {{was absorbed}} into the Southern Railway, and began an upgrade programme. All <b>locos</b> & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and {{buildings}} were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with improvements to the original Manning Wardle design.|$|E

5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric <b>locos.</b> as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
5|$|Barr {{died before}} AAA {{had a chance}} to move on with the storyline after When Worlds Collide. Barr's death was {{followed}} shortly afterwards by the Mexican peso crisis, which meant most of the US-based wrestlers were able to earn only a fraction of what they were used to while working for AAA. The peso crisis led to Eddie Guerrero working for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) instead. At the time of Barr's death, both wrestlers were in negotiations to work for ECW part-time, which became full-time in 1995. Guerrero would later end up working full-time for World Championship Wrestling, which had produced When Worlds Collide. After Barr's death, AAA retired the AAA World Tag Team Championship in Barr's honor. With Barr dying and Guerrero leaving, Los Gringos <b>Locos</b> was abandoned as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos <b>Locos,</b> Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

25|$|The batch D5096–D5113 {{were all}} {{allocated}} to Gateshead depot in 1966 to replace 9F steam <b>locos</b> on the Tyne Dock to Consett iron ore trains. These workings used a special design of bogie hopper wagon, and these <b>locos</b> had an additional compressor and associated pipework. These workings, typically with loads of around 1,000 tons, were double-headed and continued until {{taken over by}} Class 37s in the 1970s, when these <b>locos</b> were reallocated to Scottish depots.

25|$|After Guerrero {{turned on}} Santo and allied with Art Barr as La Pareja del Terror (The Pair of Terror), the duo became {{arguably the most}} hated tag team in lucha libre history. Along with Barr, Konnan, Chicano Power, and Madonna’s Boyfriend, Guerrero formed Los Gringos <b>Locos</b> (The Crazy Americans), a villainous stable. Guerrero later said {{that no matter how}} many people joined Los Gringos <b>Locos,</b> the stable was all about Barr. <b>Locos</b> feuded mostly with El Hijo del Santo and his partner Octagón, {{eventually}} ending in a Hair vs. Mask match at the first lucha pay-per-view in America, When Worlds Collide, which they lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot scheme}} {{locomotives}} were delivered in overall green livery with a grey roof and black below the body.

This light grey stripe may have appeared bluish and {{has been described as}} pale blue or eggshell, but in most illustrations it appears to be off-white. At first green liveried <b>locos</b> had plain green ends, but this was changed from 1962 to small yellow warning panels, and then from 1967 to full yellow ends, some <b>locos</b> receiving these while still in green livery. At least five <b>locos</b> were repainted in two-tone green livery (applied along with the small yellow warning panel) in a similar manner to Class 47s and some Class 25s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>loco</b> gene encodes several {{different}} isoforms of a regulator of G-protein signalling. These different isoforms of <b>LOCO</b> {{are part of}} a pathway enabling cells to respond to external signals. <b>LOCO</b> is known to be required at various developmental stages including neuroblast division, glial cell formation and oogenesis. Less is known about <b>LOCO</b> and its involvement in male development therefore to gain further insight into the role of <b>LOCO</b> in development we carried out a genetic screen and analysed males with reduced fertility. Results We identified a number of lethal <b>loco</b> mutants and four semi-lethal lines, which generate males with reduced fertility. We have identified a fifth <b>loco</b> transcript and show that it is differentially expressed in developing pupae. We have characterised the expression pattern of all <b>loco</b> transcripts during pupal development in the adult testes, both in wild type and <b>loco</b> mutant strains. In addition we also show that there are various G-protein α subunits expressed in the testis all of which may be potential binding partners of <b>LOCO.</b> Conclusion We propose that the male sterility in the new <b>loco</b> mutants result from a failure of accurate morphogenesis of the adult reproductive system during metamorphosis, we propose that this is due to a loss of expression of <b>loco</b> c 3. Thus, we conclude that specific isoforms of <b>loco</b> are required for the differentiation of the male gonad and genital disc. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{complete}} {{production run}} of 50 locomotives {{was built in}} {{just over a year}} and numbered from D400 to D449. D400 entered service in October 1967 and deliveries were completed with D449 in November 1968. Unusually, the ownership of the locomotives remained with the manufacturer and they were operated by British Rail on a 10-year lease which included certain stipulations relating to availability. The D prefix was quickly dropped as for all diesel <b>locos</b> after steam had disappeared in 1968. The <b>locos</b> ran as 400 to 449 from 1969 to 1974.|$|E
25|$|As {{deliveries}} continued allocations {{were made}} to both the London Midland Region and Eastern Region, and with the class becoming familiar to crews and staff around London they were used on freight trains over the Metropolitan Widened Lines, <b>locos</b> so used being fitted with London Transport tripcocks – although these were removed after closure of this route in 1971. <b>Locos</b> allocated to East Anglia for use on freight soon became redundant due to the run down of freight in that region, and these were in turn moved to Wales and Lancashire.|$|E

These 5000 hp locomotives are fit {{to run at}} 140 km/h but due to limitation of sectional speed, coromandel express runs at a maximum permissible speed of 120 km/h. Immediately after electrification, this train was hauled by Secunderabad (Lallaguda) based WAP-4 <b>loco</b> from Chennai to Howrah but due to difficulty and excessive time required to reverse <b>loco</b> at Vishakhapatnam, subsequently {{it was decided to}} run it by Santragachi based <b>Loco</b> from Howrah to Vishakhapatnam and from Vishakhapatnam to Chennai by Erode-based <b>loco.</b> When Royapuram shed came up near Chennai, Royapuram based <b>loco</b> is utilized to haul it from Vishakhapatnam to Chennai.|$|R

25|$|Initial {{deliveries}} {{were for}} {{operation in the}} Crewe and Derby areas, but fifteen of the initial twenty were diverted for use on the Southern Region to cover for delays in the Kent Coast Electrification scheme. Here the heavy weight was not acceptable and the <b>locos</b> in question had to have their boilers removed before they were accepted. Later some <b>locos</b> had their boilers re-fitted and these examples could be found, often in tandem with a Class 33 to provide steam heating to the coaches, the 33s only having electric train heat (ETH).|$|E

25|$|The next {{batch of}} <b>locos,</b> D5114–D5132, were {{allocated}} to Inverness, and became synonymous with rail {{operations in the}} Scottish Highlands, as did a similar batch of Class 26 <b>locos,</b> the two being considered interchangeable in operation. Single Class 24s operated from Inverness on passenger and freight trains of up to 290 tons, and double-headed on trains up to 580 tons including the Royal Highlander which was regularly made up of 16 coaches. Class 24s and Class 26s were used turn and turn about until all Class 24s allocated to Inverness were replaced by Class 26s in 1975.|$|E
