50|$|<b>Lardons</b> are {{frequently}} used in French cuisine to flavor salads, stews (such as beef bourguignon and Julia Child's coq au vin), quiches (quiche Lorraine), potatoes, omelettes and other dishes. A particular Parisian use of <b>lardons</b> {{is in the}} salade aux <b>lardons,</b> a wilted salad (often made with frisée (endive) lettuce) in which the lettuce leaves are wilted slightly {{by the addition of}} still-hot <b>lardons</b> and hot vinaigrette. A nineteenth-century recipe for a pie à la chasse calls for beef to be larded with <b>lardons</b> made of ham and bacon. A traditional dish from the Alsace region is the tarte flambée, a thin pizza-like bread covered with crème fraiche, onion, and <b>lardons.</b> A regional specialty from the Savoie is tartiflette, which is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, cream, and <b>lardons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quiche lorraine is {{a popular}} variant that was {{originally}} an open pie with eggs, cream and <b>lardons.</b> In English-speaking countries, modern preparations of the dish usually include mature cheese (Cheddar cheese often being used in British varieties), and the <b>lardons</b> are replaced by bacon.|$|R

He continued his work with the Olympic athletes while expanding his presence in the golf world. He has worked with the 2001 British Open champion, David Duval; the 2002 PGA champion, Rich Beem, the 2005 U.S. Open champion, Michael Campbell [...] and five-time major champion Phil Mickelson.

50|$|<b>Lardon</b> Chase, the Holies and Lough Down {{are three}} {{adjacent}} National Trust countryside {{properties in the}} English county of Berkshire. They are situated {{on the edge of}} the Berkshire Downs above the village of Streatley and overlooking the Goring Gap. Together they comprise an outstanding area of 27 hectares (67 acres) of downland and woodland with many attractive walks and views. <b>Lardon</b> Chase, and a part of the Holies known as Holies Down, are also designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The properties lie within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and in an area known for the presence of several Neolithic and Iron Age forts.|$|E

50|$|In many cuisines {{around the}} world, pork fat {{is used as}} a flavoring, and <b>lardons</b> are found in various other cultures. In Puerto Rico, they are called tocino and are added to dishes such as arroz con gandules.|$|R
5000|$|A {{traditional}} use for <b>lardons</b> is in {{a technique}} called [...] "larding", in which long strips of chilled pork fat are threaded (with {{the use of a}} needle) into meats that are to be braised or roasted, such as beef filets or veal (especially lean cuts), poultry, and lean fish such as salmon. These <b>lardons</b> are to be cut in strips about 3 mm thick and 3 mm wide, and it is essential that the fat be chilled before cutting and threading. The technique is explained at length in the classic book of French cuisine La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange, which details two techniques: surface larding, or [...] "studding", in which the <b>lardons</b> are threaded onto the surface, and interior larding, in which the <b>lardons</b> are left in a channel (made with a larger-sized needle than is used for studding) inside the meat. Madame St. Ange recommends larding for braised calf's sweetbreads (as does the French Laundry cookbook) and for a specific style of cooking hare. American food writer James Peterson specifically recommends using fatback for larding; salt pork, he says, [...] "has a funny taste and won't work". [...] Julia Child recommends using lard or porkbellies (pancetta); she too thinks that neither salt pork nor bacon work, and suggests blanching these first, {{to get rid of the}} overwhelming cured or smoked flavors. The origin of larding is in the Middle Ages, when edible meat was sourced from hunting game and was often too lean and tough because of the animal's natural physical activity; larding provided the equivalent of today's marbling.|$|R
5000|$|A former United States Table Tennis Junior Champion, as {{well the}} 1981 United States National Sports Festival gold {{medalist}} in mixed doubles table tennis, <b>Lardon</b> attended Stanford University, where he studied psychology. Lardon’s senior research paper for Professor Albert Bandura (Social learning theory) was on mental visualization {{in the context of}} human peak performance. He also was a teaching assistant for Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Principal investigator of the Stanford Prison Study), Dr. Robert Ornstein (Author of the [...] "Psychology of Consciousness") and for Dr. Stephen LaBerge, a leader in the scientific study of lucid dreaming. In 1985, <b>Lardon</b> received his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lardon</b> Chase and Lough Down {{comprise}} a spur of downland which lies {{to the west}} of Goring and Streatley. Since it was acquired by the National Trust, the land has been managed by a mixture of scrub clearance and cattle grazing, so as to encourage the growth of chalk-loving plants. The Holies is a woodland fringed grassy coombe which is separated from <b>Lardon</b> Chase and Lough Down by the B4009 road from Streatley to Newbury. Before acquisition by the National Trust, the Holies was used for motorbike scrambling and turf stripping, resulting in considerable damage to the ground. The National Trust is encouraging the natural recolonisation of the area by chalk-loving plant species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lardons</b> (spekjes) {{are often}} added for flavoring. It is also common {{to make a}} small hole {{in the top of the}} mix on the plate and fill it with gravy, known in Dutch as a kuiltje jus (little gravy pit).|$|R
50|$|In French cuisine, <b>lardons</b> {{are served}} hot in salads and salad dressings, {{as well as}} on some tartes flambées, stews such as beef bourguignon, quiches such as quiche Lorraine, in omelettes, with potatoes, and for other dishes such as coq au vin.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the meat}} was larded with <b>lardons,</b> but modern beef is {{sufficiently}} tender and well-marbled, so this very time-consuming technique is rarely used any more. However, bacon {{cut into small}} cubes is still used to produce the initial cooking fat and added to the dish at the end.|$|R

50|$|In July 1994 <b>Lardon</b> {{continued}} his clinical studies in athletic peak performance during his fellowship in Psychobiology and Psychopharmacology at UCSD. After his fellowship {{he started his}} career as a sports psychiatrist on the PGA Tour, first helping Kemper Open champion Mike Springer. In 2001, <b>Lardon</b> was contacted by James Bauman, Senior Sports Psychologist at the United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, CA, to evaluate U.S. Olympic skeleton hopeful Jimmy Shea who had been referred to him for the treatment of depression. Jimmy Shea won the Olympic gold medal in the skeleton in 2001. Immediately after winning Olympic gold medal Shea pulled out a picture card of his grandfather, Jack Shea (two-time Olympic speed skating champion) and held the picture up for the National and International media in celebration of his victory. In Guidepost magazine, Shea credits Dr. <b>Lardon</b> for giving the suggestion of taking his grandfather’s photo and putting it in his helmet {{on the day of the}} race. After the 2002 Olympics, Jimmy Shea and Dr. Lardon’s work together was chronicled in an article in Sports Illustrated magazine, they then went on a public relations tour, sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst focusing on the destigmatization of depression in men.|$|E
