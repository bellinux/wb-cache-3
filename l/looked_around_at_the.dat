6000|$|Frenson <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little library. [...] "Well, I'll {{hold them}} {{together}} for a while. Maybe you'll {{be able to come}} back and graduate, after all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} he would prefer a good home to {{traveling}} around with a cheap jewelry man," [...] was Matt's comment, as he <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> comfortable house Mrs. Inwold occupied. [...] "I know I would." ...|$|E

60|$|Jeanne {{turned and}} walked toward the door. On the threshold, however, she paused. There were many times, she remembered, when her {{stepmother}} had been kind to her. She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Princess, sitting with her head resting upon her clasped hands.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{tiny room}} with its {{struggling}} fire and horsehair sofa, linoleum for carpet, oleographs for pictures, and he shivered, not for his own sake but for hers. On the sideboard were some bread and cheese {{and a bottle of}} ginger beer.|$|E
