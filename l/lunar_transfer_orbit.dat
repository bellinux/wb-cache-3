Additionally, these designs can be restricted by {{the selection of the}} Cubesat subsystem design such as propulsion or communication. Nonetheless, many trajectory options can be designed with have a wide range of transfer durations, fuel requirements, and final destinations. Our investigation of potential trajectories highlights several design options including deployment into low Earth <b>orbit</b> (LEO), geostationary <b>transfer</b> <b>orbits</b> (GTO), and higher energy direct <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>orbits.</b> In addition to direct transfer options from these initial orbits, we also investigate the use of longer duration Earth-Moon dynamical systems. For missions with an intended lunar orbit, much of the design process is spent optimizing a ballistic capture while other science locations such as Sun-Earth libration or heliocentric orbits may simply require a reduced Delta-V imparted at a convenient location along the trajectory. In this article we examine several design options that meet the above limited deployment and subsystem drivers. We study ways that both impulsive and low-thrust Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) engines can be used to place the Cubesat first into a highly eccentric Earth orbit, enter the Moon's Sphere of Influence, and finally achieve a highly eccentric lunar orbit. We show that such low-thrust transfers are feasible with a realistic micro-thruster model, assuming that the Cubesat can generate sufficient power for the SEP. Two examples are shown here: (1) A Cubestat injected by Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1) then employing low thrust; and (2) a CubSat deployed in a GTO, then employing impulsive maneuvers. For the EM- 1 injected initial design, we increase the EM- 1 targeted lunar flyby distance to reduce the energy of the lunar flyby to match that of a typical lMoon system heteroclinic manifold. Figure 1 presents an option that encompasses the similar dynamics as that of the ARTEMIS mission design. Low-thrust maneuvers are used along the manifold trajectory to raise perigee to that of a lunar orbit, adjust the timing with respect to the Moon, rotate the line of apsides, and target a ballistic lunar encounter. In this design a second flyby decreases the orbital energy with respect to the Moon, so that C 3 - 0. 1 km 2 s 2. Another design, shown in Figure 2 emanates from a GTO then uses impulsive maneuvers to phase onto a local Earth-Moon manifold, which then transfers the CubeSat to a lunar encounter...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{how to use}} dynamical systemsmethods to construct families of low-energy ballistic <b>transfers</b> to <b>lunar</b> Halo <b>orbits.</b> The low-energy <b>transfers</b> implement invariant manifold pathways to transfer from an initial LEO parking orbit to a final lunar Halo orbit using only a single injection maneuver from LEO. The ballistic transfers require about 100 more days, but 15 % less energy, than conventionalHohmann transfers. The families of <b>lunar</b> Halo <b>orbit</b> <b>transfers</b> presented here reveal that missions may depart the Earth at nearly any inclination or {{at any time during}} the year; once at the Moon, these transfers permit access to almost any final lunar orbit, including polar orbits. The dynamical systems method makes it possible to quickly identify families of these transfers, allowing mission designers to review the parameters of many transfers simultaneously in order to meet their mission design requirements...|$|R

50|$|Long March 9 (LM-9, CZ-9, or Changzheng 9, Chinese: 长征九号) is a Chinese super-heavy {{carrier rocket}} that is {{currently}} in study.

40|$|We {{describe}} a space systems architecture for repeatedly transporting payloads between low Earth orbit {{and the surface}} of the moon without significant use of propellant. This architecture consists of one rotating tether in elliptical, equatorial Earth orbit and a second rotating tether in a circular low lunar orbit. The Earth-orbit tether picks up a payload from a circular low Earth orbit and tosses it into a minimal-energy <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit.</b> When the payload arrives at the Moon, the lunar tether catches it and deposits it on {{the surface of the}} Moon. Simultaneously, the lunar tether picks up a lunar payload to be sent down to the Earth orbit tether. By transporting equal masses to and from the Moon, the orbital energy and momentum of the system can be conserved, eliminating the need for transfer propellant. Using currently available high-strength tether materials, this system could be built with a total mass of less than 28 times the mass of the payloads it can transport. Using numerical simulations that incorporate the full three-dimensional orbital mechanics and tether dynamics, we have verified the feasibility of this system architecture and developed scenarios for transferring a payload from a low Earth orbit to the surface of the Moon that require less than 25 m/s of thrust for trajectory targeting corrections...|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{designing}} the Ares V cargo launch vehicle to vastly expand {{exploration of the}} Moon begun in the Apollo program and enable the exploration of Mars and beyond. As the largest launcher in history, Ares V also represents a national asset offering unprecedented opportunities for new science, national security, and commercial missions of unmatched size and scope. The Ares V is the heavy-lift component of NASA's dual-launch architecture that will replace the current space shuttle fleet, complete the International Space Station, and establish a permanent human presence on the Moon as a stepping-stone to destinations beyond. During extensive independent and internal architecture and vehicle trade studies {{as part of the}} Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), NASA selected the Ares I crew launch vehicle and the Ares V to support future exploration. The smaller Ares I will launch the Orion crew exploration vehicle with four to six astronauts into orbit. The Ares V is designed to carry the Altair lunar lander into orbit, rendezvous with Orion, and send the mated spacecraft toward lunar orbit. The Ares V will be the largest and most powerful launch vehicle in history, providing unprecedented payload mass and volume to establish a permanent lunar outpost and explore significantly more of the lunar surface than was done during the Apollo missions. The Ares V consists of a Core Stage, two Reusable Solid Rocket Boosters (RSRBs), Earth Departure Stage (EDS), and a payload shroud. For lunar missions, the shroud would cover the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM). The Ares V Core Stage is 33 feet in diameter and 212 feet in length, making it the largest rocket stage ever built. It is the same diameter as the Saturn V first stage, the S-IC. However, its length is about the same as the combined length of the Saturn V first and second stages. The Core Stage uses a cluster of five Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RS- 68 B rocket engines, each supplying about 700, 000 pounds of thrust. Its propellants are liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The two solid rocket boosters provide about 3. 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. These 5. 5 -segment boosters are derived from the 4 -segment boosters now used on the Space Shuttle, and are similar to those used in the Ares I first stage. The EDS is powered by one J- 2 X engine. The J- 2 X, which has roughly 294, 000 pounds of thrust, also powers the Ares I Upper Stage. It is derived from the J- 2 that powered the Saturn V second and third stages. The EDS performs two functions. Its initial suborbital burns will place the lunar lander into a stable Earth orbit. After the Orion crew vehicle, launched separately on an Ares I, docks with the lander/EDS stack, EDS will ignite a second time to put the combined 65 -metric ton vehicle into a <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>orbit.</b> When it stands on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center late in the next decade, the Ares V stack will be approximately 381 feet tall and have a gross liftoff mass of 8. 1 million pounds. The current point-of-departure design exceeds Saturn V s mass capability by approximately 40 percent. Using the current payload shroud design, Ares V can carry 315, 000 pounds to 29 -degree low Earth orbit (LEO) or 77, 000 pounds to a geosynchronous orbit. Another unique aspect of the Ares V is the 33 -foot-diameter payload shroud, which encloses approximately 30, 400 cubic feet of usable volume. A larger hypothetical shroud for encapsulating larger payloads has been studied. While Ares V makes possible larger payload masses and volumes, it may alternately make possible more cost-effective mission design if the relevant payload communities are willing to consider an alternative to the existing approach that has driven them to employ complexity to solve current launch vehicle mass and volume constraints. By using Ares V s mass and volume capabilities as margin, payload designers stand to reduce development risk and cost. Significant progress has been made on the Ares V to support a plaed fiscal 2011 authority-to-proceed (ATP) milestone. The Ares V team is actively reaching out to external organizations during this early concept phase to ensure that the Ares V vehicle can be leveraged for national security, science, and commercial development needs. This presentation will discuss Ares V vehicle configuration, the path to the current concept, accomplishments to date, and potential payload utilization opportunities...|$|E

Unforeseen circumstances can induce emergency situations necessitating contingency plans to ensure crew safety.

Thus an astrodynamic model for <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> has been developed to allow for characterization of the abort feasibility envelope for conceivable <b>transfer</b> <b>orbits.</b> In addition the model allows for several trade studies involving differently executed abort options, factoring in fuel margins. Two optimization schemes were utilized; one to expedite return via any fuel in excess of that required for the abort, and one to explore the boundary region of direct abort infeasibility envelope searching for plausible abort trajectories. The characterization and optimization of translunar abort trajectories for the Crew Exploration Vehicle can ensure increased crew survivability in emergency situations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{parametric design}} studies of electric propulsion <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> vehicles. In designing a <b>lunar</b> <b>transfer</b> vehicle, selecting the 'best' operating {{points for the}} design parameters allows significant reductions in the mass in low earth orbit (LEO) for the mission.

Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to reduce launcher delta-V (V) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk.
