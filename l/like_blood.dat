25|$|Microneurography is a {{technique}} using metal electrodes to observe neural traffic of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons in efferent and afferent neurons of the skin and muscle. This technique is particularly important in research involving C fibers. Single action potentials from unmyelinated axons can be observed. Recordings from efferent postganglionic sympathetic C fibers of the muscles and skin yield insights into the neural control of autonomic effector organs <b>like</b> <b>blood</b> vessels and sweat glands. Readings of afferent discharges from C nociceptors identified by marking method have also proved helpful in revealing the mechanisms underlying sensations such as itch.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, a Swedish {{pharmaceutical}} company, Kabi, contracted {{with a number}} of hospitals in Europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial GH product, Crescormon. Although an additional source of GH was welcomed, Crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. The first concern was that Kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the U.S., which would quickly undermine the NPA, which relied on a donation system <b>like</b> <b>blood</b> transfusion. As the number of autopsies continued to shrink, would pathologists sell pituitaries to a higher bidder? The second offense was Kabi-Pharmacia’s marketing campaign, which was directed at primary care physicians under the slogan, “Now, you determine the need,” implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short child might be a candidate for treatment. Although the Crescormon controversy in the U.S. is long forgotten, Kabi’s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in Europe as recently as 2000.|$|E

500|$|Grunge in Seattle has {{its roots}} in the area's [...] "varied music scene" [...] and [...] "diverse urban personality" [...] {{expressed}} by local [...] "post-punk garage bands". Grunge evolved from the local punk rock scene, and was inspired by bands such as The Fartz, The U-Men, 10 Minute Warning, The Accüsed, and the Fastbacks. Charles R. Cross states that grunge was the [...] "...culmination of twenty years of punk rock" [...] development. Cross states that the bands most representing the grunge genre were Seattle bands Blood Circus, TAD, and Mudhoney and Sub Pop's Denver band The Fluid; he states that Nirvana, with its pop influences and blend of Sonic Youth and Cheap Trick, was lighter-sounding than bands <b>like</b> <b>Blood</b> Circus.|$|E
500|$|Further {{criticism}} of the Canopus series followed, which included this comment by New York Times critic John Leonard: [...] "One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable {{is that it has}} discouraged Mrs. Lessing... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz." [...] Lessing replied by saying: [...] "What they didn't realize was that in science fiction is some of the best social fiction of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, <b>like</b> <b>Blood</b> Music, by Greg Bear. He's a great writer." [...] Lessing said in 1983 that she would like to write stories about red and white dwarves, space rockets powered by anti-gravity, and charmed and coloured quarks, [...] "ut we can't all be physicists".|$|E
500|$|There {{continues}} to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases, including BSE and CJD. They have an incubation period of months to decades, during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining the brain [...] using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc [...] form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids <b>like</b> <b>blood</b> or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood.|$|E

500|$|Swedish critics {{generally}} expressed {{positive reactions}} to the film. In 26 reviews listed at the Swedish-language review site Kritiker.se it achieved an average rating of 4.1 out of 5.

Göran Everdahl for SVT's Gomorron Sverige gave the film 4 out of 5 and described the film as [...] "kitchen sink fantasy" [...] that [...] "gives the vampire story back something it has been missing for a long time: the ability to really frighten us". Expressen and Göteborgs-Posten were less impressed and gave the film 3 out of 5. Expressen criticized it for being unappealing to those uninitiated in vampire films while Göteborgs-Posten believed the supporting characters had lost the emotional depth that made the novel so successful.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} divided into four parts: Equestrian, Bedouin, GlamPunk and Disco. The Equestrian segment of the show began with images of Madonna, riding crop in hand, and horses cantering across windswept plains on the big screens. A giant disco ball was then lowered onstage, and opened like a flower bud to reveal Madonna inside. As she took her dancers' reins, she {{performed}} [...] "Future Lovers/I Feel Love". This was followed by [...] "Get Together" [...] backed by her dancers in horse reins. She rode a carousel horse-like dancepole during [...] "Like a Virgin". The backdrops displayed the X-Ray of Madonna's broken bones, which she had during a previous accident. [...] "Jump" [...] followed this performance, where the dancers displayed the physical discipline parkour. After Madonna disappeared backstage, three of her dancers then revealed personal tragedies during an interlude called [...] "Confessions". The second segment titled Bedouin started with Madonna appearing on a mirrored crucifix to sing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] as a death toll of African AIDS victims counted down onscreen above her. She stepped down off the cross to perform [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] where two male dancers intertwined each other while displaying religious symbolism on the screens <b>like</b> <b>blood</b> corpuscles connecting to form symbols of hope and unity. Madonna brought a guest vocalist from her Confessions on a Dance Floor album onstage for [...] "Isaac", when a female dancer in an oversized Middle-Eastern burka danced within a cage with the backdrops displaying sand dunes. Madonna then recreated the dance-off scene from her [...] "Sorry" [...] music video live with her troupe for her performance of the song. The performance {{was followed by the}} song [...] "Like It Or Not" [...] where burlesque-style dancing was performed by Madonna {{with the help of a}} chair as a prop.
