25|$|An {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the hawkfish and fire coral. Thanks to their large, skinless pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on fire corals without harm. Fire corals {{are not true}} corals, but are hydrozoans possessing stinging cells called nematocysts which would normally prevent close contact. The protection fire corals offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk.</b> Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab crustaceans and other small invertebrates as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.|$|E

60|$|Cartwright was frankly puzzling. He looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sober country gentleman, {{and this}} was not the type Lister had thought to meet. His clothes were fastidiously good, his voice had a level, {{restrained}} note, but his eye was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk's,</b> as Vernon had said. Now and then one saw a twinkle of ironical amusement and some of his movements were quick and vigorous. Lister thought Cartwright's blood was red.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked upon}} Perseus keenly, {{and yet they}} never moved their eyes; and they came up the cliffs towards him more swiftly than the sea-gull, and yet they never moved their feet, nor did the breeze stir the robes about their limbs; only {{the wings of the}} youth’s sandals quivered, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk’s</b> when he hangs above the cliff. And Perseus fell down and worshipped, for he knew that they were more than man.|$|R

60|$|It is {{the fierce}} {{spirit of the}} Ego {{come out of the}} primal infinite, but detached, isolated, an aristocrat. He is not an Italian, dark-blooded. He is fair, keen as steel, with the blood of the mountaineer in him. He is like my old {{spinning}} woman. It is curious how, with his wife and child, he makes a little separate world down there in the theatre, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk's</b> nest, high and arid under the gleaming sky.|$|R

60|$|And she bore many children. For, as {{time went}} on, she never opposed her husband in word or deed. She took no notice of him, externally. She {{submitted}} to him, let him take what he wanted and do as he wanted with her. She was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> that sullenly submits to everything. The relation {{between her and her}} husband was wordless and unknown, but it was deep, awful, a relation of utter inter-destruction. And he, who triumphed in the world, he became more and more hollow in his vitality, the vitality was bled from within him, as by some haemorrhage. She was hulked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> in a cage, but her heart was fierce and undiminished within her, though her mind was destroyed.|$|E
60|$|And {{she loved}} the intent, far look of his eyes when they rested on her: intent, yet far, not near, not with her. And she wanted to bring them near. She wanted his eyes to come to hers, to know her. And they would not. They {{remained}} intent, and far, and proud, like a hawk's naive and inhuman as a hawk's. So she loved him and caressed him and roused him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk,</b> till he was keen and instant, but without tenderness. He came to her fierce and hard, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> striking and taking her. He was no mystic any more, she was his aim and object, his prey.

60|$|All {{the peasants}} {{have a passion}} for a high-road. They want their land opening out, opening out. They seem to hate the ancient Italian remoteness. They all {{want to be able to}} get out at a moment's notice, to get away--quick, quick. A village which is two miles off the high-road, even if it is perched <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk's</b> nest on <b>a</b> peak, still chafes and chafes for the great road to come to it, chafes and chafes for the daily motor-bus {{connection}} with the railway. There is no placidity, no rest in the heart of the land. There is a fever of restless irritation all the time.|$|R
60|$|Just one man {{was with}} his wife and child, and he was of the same race as my old woman at San Tommaso. He was fair, thin, and clear, abstract, of the mountains. He seemed to have {{gathered}} his wife and child together into another, finer atmosphere, like the air of the mountains, and to guard them in it. This is the real Joseph, father of the child. He has a fierce, abstract look, wild and untamed as a hawk, but <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> at its own nest, fierce with love. He goes out and buys a tiny bottle of lemonade for a penny, and the mother and child sip it in tiny sips, whilst he bends over, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> arching its wings.|$|E

60|$|Then he drew, and we fell to it desperately enough, {{till the}} sparks flew, indeed, and {{the rattle of}} steel upon steel rang down the quiet street. At first he had {{somewhat}} the better of me, for my hate made me wild in my play, but soon I settled to the work and grew cooler. I meant to kill him--more, I knew that I should kill him if none came between us.

5000|$|... "A {{horse of}} a strong and comely fashion, loving disposition, and {{infinite}} courageousness. His limbs and general features are so strong and well-knit together that he has ever been reputed the only beast for the wars, being naturally free from fear or cowardice. His head is long, lean and very slender; and does from eye to nose bend <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>hawk's</b> beak. He has a great, full eye, a sharp ear, and a straight leg, which, to an over curious eye might appear too slender -- which is all the fault curiosity itself can find. They are naturally of a lofty pace, loving to their rider, most strong in their exercise, and to conclude, as good in all points that no foreign race has ever borne a tithe so much excellence." ...|$|R
