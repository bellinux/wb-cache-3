Dornbrook to develop methods of controlling the pulverized coal's tarry ash residues with boiler feed water tube jackets that served to reduce the surface temperature of the firebox walls and allowed the ash deposits be easily removed. This plant became the first central power station in the United States to use pulverized fuel.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{analysis}} of electroencephalograms (EEG). In particular, small signals due to stimulation, so called evoked potentials, have to be detected in the background EEG. This is achieved by using a denoising implementation based on the wavelet decomposition. One recording of visual evoked potentials, and recordings of auditory evoked potentials from 4 subjects corresponding to dierent age groups are analyzed. We nd higher variability in older individuals. Moreover, since the evoked potentials are identied at the single stimulus level (without need of ensemble averaging), this will allow the calculation of better resolved averages. Since the method is parameter free (i. e. it {{does not need to be}} adapted to the particular characteristics of each recording), implementations in clinical settings are imaginable. 1 1 Introduction Evoked potentials (EP) are the alterations of the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) due to stimulation (e. g. tone, <b>light</b> <b>ash,</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{theoretically}} sound basis for the equi-partition of kinetic energy (EKE) kernel recently developed by our group to describe the evolution of granule size distributions in fluidized bed granulation. The approach taken is to show first by distinct element modelling that the statistics of fluctuating velocity and thus frequency of collisions are well described by the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) ¿that is, Maxwellian in nature. It is then possible to use KTGF to show that the size dependence of the aggregation process should indeed be given by the EKE kernel and that the rate constant depends only on the granular temperature, the particle density, the radial distribution function and the efficiency of collisions. It is shown how the kernel developed can be used to describe the evolution of a granule size distribution when low-density sodium carbonate particles (<b>Light</b> <b>Ash)</b> are sprayed with polyethylene glycol...|$|E

40|$|In a Pinus halepensis Mill. forest, a field {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate post-fire seed predation as affected by combinations of seed colour and soil substrates: light grey and black seeds combined with <b>light</b> grey <b>ash,</b> dark grey ash and pale brown sand.

40|$|The {{function}} of brain oscillations {{is seen in}} the context of various sensory, behavioural or cognitive states, and for the visual system a number of hypotheses have been proposed based on synchronized activity of different populations of neurons. A prerequisite for the type of synchronisation suggested is that visual stimuli are capable of affecting (resetting) the phase of brain oscillations. A change in the phase of brain waves assumingly also occurs in the Berger effect : If observers open their eyes, the amplitude of EEG oscillations in the alpha band (8 13 Hz) decreases or disappears completely. One interpretation is that due to visual stimulation oscillations in different neurons or neuronal populations are desynchronised. For a functional interpretation of brain oscillations it therefore seems crucial to nd out whether or not the phase of these brain oscillations can be affected by visual stimuli. To answer this question one has to examine whether brain waves are generated by linear or nonlinear mechanisms. If they are due to linear band pass ltering or linear oscillators, no phase resetting is possible, as the superposition law holds: the response to a stimulus is just superimposed on the ongoing oscillation, no phase resetting is possible. In contrast, in nonlinear oscillators (as described e. g. by the van der Pol equation), phases can be reset e. g. by an impulse. We analysed the question of linearity of alpha waves by investigating whether or not the superposition law holds: Light ashes were presented randomly, as usual, or at particular phases of the alpha waves. The result: the evoked potential to a ash, given at a particular phase, basically is the superposition of the alpha wave and the evoked potential to ashes presented randomly (which is without alpha contribution). This holds only, however, if one assumes that within 200 to 300 ms after a <b>light</b> <b>ash</b> the amplitude of alpha waves decreases in a ash intensity dependent degree. Conclusion: the phase of alpha, perhaps also of gamma waves cannot be reset by visual stimuli. This questions existing theories about the {{function of}} these waves. The Berger effect is not due to event related de- synchronisation. The amplitude of alpha waves after a ash are reduced {{in the same way as}} that of evoked potentials, due to the loss of sensitivity by light adaptation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} twenty years Mount Etna has {{produced}} more than one hundred explosive events ranging from <b>light</b> <b>ash</b> emissions to violent sub-plinian eruptions. Significant hazards arise from tephra plumes which directly threaten air traffic, and generate fallout affecting surrounding towns and infrastructures. We describe the first radar system, named VOLDORAD 2 B, fully integrated into a volcano instrumental network dedicated to the continuous near-source monitoring of tephra emissions from Etna's summit craters. This 23. 5 cm wavelength pulsed Doppler radar is operated in collaboration between the Observatoire de Physique du Globe de Clermont-Ferrand (OPGC) and the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Etneo (INGV-OE) since 2009. Probed volumes inside the fixed, northward-pointing conical beam total about 1. 5 km in length, covering the summit craters which produced all recent tephra plumes. The backscattered power, related to the amount of particles crossing the beam, and particle along-beam velocities are recorded every 0. 23 s, providing a proxy for the tephra mass eruption rate. Radar raw data are transmitted in real-time to the volcano monitoring center of INGV-OE in Catania and are used to automatically release alerts at onset and end of eruptive events. Processed radar parameters are also made available from the VOLDORAD database online ([URL] In addition to eruptive crater discrimination by range gating, relative variations of eruption intensity can be tracked, including through overcast weather when other optical or infrared methods may fail to provide information. Short-lived dense ash emissions can be detected as illustrated for weak ash plumes from the Bocca Nuova and New South East craters in 2010. The comparison with thermal images suggests that the front mushroom of individual ash plumes holds the largest particles (coarse ash and small lapilli) and concentrations at least within the first hundred meters. For these short-lived ash plumes, the highest particle mass flux seems to occur typically within the first 10 s. We also analyze data from the first lava fountain generating an ash and lapilli plume on 12 January 2011 that initiated a series of 25 paroxysmal episodes of the New South East Crater until April 2012. We illustrate the pulsating behavior of the lava fountain and show that vertical velocities reached 250 m s− 1 (with brief peaks exceeding 300 m s− 1), leading to mean and maximum tephra fluxes (DRE) of 185 and 318 m 3 s− 1 (with peaks exceeding 380 m 3 s− 1) respectively, and a total volume of pyroclasts emitted during the lava fountain phase of 1. 3 × 106 m 3. Finally, we discuss capacities and limits of the instrument, along with future work aimed at providing source term inputs to tephra dispersal models in order to improve hazard assessment and risk mitigation at Etna...|$|E

40|$|High-harmonic {{generation}} (HHG) is investigated theoretically {{aiming to}} improve its fundamental understanding and overcome current limitations. In the course of this, HHG is extended to higher energies and used to generate x-ray pulses with durations down to the zeptosecond regime. To this end, a route is discussed to generate multi-kiloelectronvolt harmonics with relativistic laser intensities circumventing both the phasematching problem and relativistic drift. In a different approach, the state-of-the art attosecond science is transferred to the x-ray regime by manipulating the atom during the excursion of the continuum electron. By coherently exciting a core electron, the continuum electron is forced to recombine with the core hole with a much higher binding energy. HHG is the cutting-edge technology allowing {{for the creation of}} the shortest coherent <b>light</b> <b>ashes</b> of all. However, particularly problematic is the intrinsic chirp of the HHG light that requires the use of optical elements to compensate it. For this purpose, the harmonic generation process is altered such that chirp-free pulses are generated with possible pulse duration below one attosecond. Moreover, in a more fundamental work, the HHG process is set into the framework of a unified interference picture. In that picture, all possible HHG transitions can be viewed as an interference between two wave packets in the binding potential leading to photoemission at their difference energy. A novel continuum-continuum transition is studied and its importance in the saturation regime is pointed out...|$|R
40|$|The {{heavy element}} ashes of rp-process {{hydrogen}} and helium burning in accreting neutron stars are compressed to high density where they freeze, forming the outer crust of the star. We calculate the chemical separation on freezing {{for a number of}} different nuclear mixtures resulting from a range of burning conditions for the rp-process. We confirm the generic result that light nuclei are preferentially retained in the liquid and heavy nuclei in the solid. This is in agreement with the previous study of a 17 -component mixture of rp-process ashes by Horowitz et al. (2007), but extends that result to a much larger range of compositions. We also find an alternate phase separation regime for the <b>lightest</b> <b>ash</b> mixtures which does not demonstrate this generic behaviour. With a few exceptions, we find that chemical separation reduces the expected Q_ imp in the outer crust compared to the initial rp-process ash, where Q_ imp measures the mean-square dispersion in atomic number Z of the nuclei in the mixture. We find that the fractional spread of Z plays a role in setting the amount of chemical separation and is strongly correlated to the divergence between the two/three-component approximations and the full component model. The contrast in Y_e between the initial rp-process ashes and the equilibrium liquid composition is similar to that assumed in earlier two-component models of compositionally driven convection, except for very light compositions which produce nearly negligible convective driving. We discuss the implications of these results for observations of accreting neutron stars...|$|R

This post-fire assessment is very useful because allow to identify the degree of destruction imposed by the fire. Among the techniques used to determine fire severity, ash colour is often used, that permit identify the degree of organic matter consumption (darker <b>ash</b> uncompleted combustion, <b>lighter</b> <b>ash</b> completed combustion). The objective {{of this paper was}} observed if fire severity changes in space and time, according to ash colour analysis, applying an index. The ash colour analysis was carried out one and fifteen days after the fire. In this area we identified ash with four different colours, black (B) dark grey (DG), light gray (LG) and white colour (W) and some uncovered areas classified as bared soil (BS). Black and DG represent medium fire severity, LG and W, higher severity. The results showed that in the studied fire, the severity was high and a great part of the plot was uncovered by ash (BS). Fifteen days after BS increased as the fire severity index, from 6. 05 to 6. 45, showing that during this period the ash redistribution in a short period after the fire can influence the fire severity assessment. We did not identified significant differences between measurements and the coefficient of variation (CV%) remained the same. However significant differences were identified with the spatial correlation analysis with Global Moran's I and the spatial structure of fire severity index. This is evidence that ash color changed in this period in the space and the traditional statistical methods did not detected, only with spatial analysis. The analysis of fire severity using ash color some days after the fire can induce important errors, because wind can (re) mix ash and a particle produced in one area can be easily exported to other...|$|R
