No fees were ever charged, and the rides proved to be quite popular. By 1951, three miniature engines were in operation on Sundays and holidays, [...] "two of them steam and the other diesel." [...] The miniature railway moved to Freeport in 1953, when the LIRR needed the land on which the New York <b>Live</b> <b>Steamer</b> Society had been using without charge.|$|E

5000|$|The Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum (LALSRM) is a {{non-profit}} public-benefit corporation founded in 1956 by live steam enthusiasts {{for the purpose}} of educating the public about railroad history and lore, and to promote live steam and scale model railroad technology. The museum is located in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California and is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Sunday weather permitting. In 1956, all of the model locomotives were steam-powered, hence the name [...] "Live Steamers".

The museum operates a [...] gauge miniature railway on which these locomotives pull trains that the public can ride.|$|R
5000|$|Ollie's lifelong hobby was {{live steam}} trains. Starting in 1949, he built the [...] gauge La Cañada Valley Railroad, a {{miniature}} backyard railroad with three 1:12-scale locomotives {{at his home}} in Flintridge, California. [...] The locomotives are now owned by his sons. This railroad was one of the inspirations for Walt Disney to build his own backyard railroad, the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, which inspired the building of the railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Ollie was a founding Governor of the Carolwood Pacific Historical Society along with his fellow Disney animator and railfan, Ward Kimball. The 1:4-scale Victorian depot from Ollie's backyard was restored and moved to a location near Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum in Griffith Park, Los Angeles.|$|R
5000|$|Tickets can be {{purchased}} to ride the Travel Town Railroad, a [...] gauge miniature railway for two circles around the museum grounds. This railway originally ran a train known as the Melody Ranch Special, which was once owned by Gene Autry. Its namesake originates from the Gene Autry film Melody Ranch. The passenger coaches are now covered and the original steam engine (which was sabotaged beyond economical repair) has been replaced with Courage, a chain-driven internal combustion motor housed within a façade representing a steam locomotive. This railroad {{is one of three}} miniature railway train rides within Griffith Park. The others are the [...] gauge Griffith Park & Southern Railroad and the [...] gauge miniature railway at the Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum. The latter is independently operated.|$|R
2500|$|After Lillian Disney died in 1997, the Disney residence, {{including}} {{the area where}} the CPRR was located, was put up for sale. Mexican investor Gabriel Brener, who bought the property in 1998, demolished the original house due to issues with lead paint, lead piping, asbestos, and a weak foundation. In 2013, before the property was sold to an unknown buyer the following year, the CPRR's tunnel was still in place. In 1999, Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, the CPRR's former control center, was relocated to the Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum. Morgan [...] "Bill" [...] Evans, the original landscaper of the Disney residence and several Disney theme parks, arranged for Walt Disney Imagineering to provide a landscaping plan for the barn's new site. On July 19, 1999, Diane Disney Miller, Walt Disney's daughter, participated in the rededication ceremony for the barn.|$|R
5000|$|The Maricopa <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> {{organization}} {{is the oldest}} {{of its kind in}} Arizona. They currently run three 7 1/2" [...] gauge train engines. From 1996 through 1999, the MLS created three miles of track which was placed outside the Sahuaro Central. A loop of the track was built around the museum in 1998 and there are now more than 14 miles of tracks. The MLS provides free train rides on Sundays during the months of September through May. The train rides begin in Adobe Station and run through the rugged desert. Among the layouts there are working block signals, a tunnel and many trestles. The MLS's Arizona Western Railroad is the largest miniature railroad setup {{of its kind in the}} United States. The MLS also created an old 1890 western themed town with false fronts on their storage units.|$|R

50|$|Hurlbut's {{amusement}} park experience began with designing and building small-scale trains {{for people to}} ride. He sold 12 of them to other operators, then installed one in his own kiddie park in El Monte, CA {{in the parking lot}} of Crafords market.One of Hurlbut's trainsets operated at The Pike in Long Beach, CA. He also designed the replica 1880's train that ran for many years in Santa's Village in the San Bernardino Mountains, and now is at the Santa Ana Zoo. He built the first train for the Nut Tree restaurant complex in Vacaville, CA that would ferry incoming flyers from the Nut Tree Airport to the toy shop and restaurant plaza. Another of Hurbut's trains, built in 1938, is in operation at Adventure City, which is part of the Hobby City complex in Anaheim, CA.

5000|$|Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, his {{personal}} workshop building and creative space for his miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad, was loaned to the City of Los Angeles by the Walt Disney Family Foundation in 1999. The barn is {{located within the}} Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum complex. Complementary public admission to these exhibits {{is available on the}} third Sunday of each month from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., which coincides with demonstrations of the stationary steam plant. The barn is referred to by the Carolwood Society as [...] "the only free Disney attraction in the world". The barn has an extensive collection of Disney and steam-train-related memorabilia.

A surviving locomotive and two train cars from the former Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland Disneyland attraction will also be displayed next to the barn after they are restored by the Carolwood Foundation.|$|R
40|$|The "Manitoulin" was {{a wooden}} {{propellor}} vessel built at Owen Sound, Ont. in 1879 - 1880, for the Great Northern Trans. Co. and operated between Collingwood, Owen Sound and the Canadian Sault. In her third season, she left Collingwood on May 17, 1882 with heavy freight and passengers for northern points. On {{the second day}} when on Manitowaning Bay, fire was discovered. The ship headed for shore and passengers jumped overboard with some loss of <b>lives.</b> The <b>steamer</b> burned to water's edge and later the hull was taken away and rebuilt into the "Atlantic", which burned in Georgian Bay near Parry Sound, Ont. on Nov. 10, 1903...|$|R

5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles <b>Live</b> <b>Steamers</b> Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|R
2500|$|From 1877 to 1927, {{government}} steamers {{such as the}} NZGSS Hinemoa, {{patrolled the}} depots to check for survivors and maintain the facilities.
