50|$|In certain cases, the <b>lien</b> <b>of</b> another {{creditor}} (or {{the interest}} of an owner) may take priority over a federal tax lien even if the NFTL was filed before the other creditor's lien was perfected (or before the owner's interest was acquired).

5000|$|Some {{supporters}} of infant baptism argue that circumcision is the sign <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> God made with Abraham {{and should be}} received by all the members <b>of</b> his <b>covenant.</b> The children <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> Abraham's <b>covenant</b> are themselves members <b>of</b> Abraham's <b>covenant.</b> Christians are members <b>of</b> Abraham's <b>covenant</b> [...] Therefore, the children of Christians are members <b>of</b> Abraham's <b>covenant.</b> Since baptism is the New Testament form of circumcision, the children of Christians should receive the sign <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> by being baptised.|$|R

40|$|Using three {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness, I {{examine the}} association between the ex ante design <b>of</b> debt <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness and the ex post exercise of creditor control rights. I find that contracts with higher level <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness at loan origination {{are more likely to}} subsequently experience both covenant violations and renegotiations, suggesting that stricter covenants translate into more frequent exercise of creditor control rights. Further, I find that the specific channel through which creditor control rights are exercised is influenced by the type of the most restrictive covenant in the original contract. Overall, my results imply that the ex ante design <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> restrictiveness {{plays an important role in}} the ex post transfer of control rights...|$|R

We argue that when lenders fix excessive stringent covenants this may generate inefficient underinvestment when a firm {{is close to}} a covenant violation, particularly for good quality firms. However, when a covenant violation does occur, these firms increase investment and this has a positive effect in performance. This paper warns of the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> tightness {{as a way to}} control borrowers and remarks on some positive aspects <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> violations particularly for good quality firms.

50|$|Concepts {{foundational}} {{to covenant}} theology {{can be found}} in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God's salvation economy under the categories <b>of</b> a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. John Calvin (Institutes 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger (A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> God), focused on the continuity <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534-83) in Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536-87) in Concerning the Substance <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace between God and the Elect (De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555-99) in A Treatise of our Effectual Calling (Tractatus de vocatione efficaci, 1597), developed the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.|$|R
