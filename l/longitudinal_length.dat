Methods 40 neonate Wistar female rats were separated into: monosodium glutamate group (GluM, n = 20) and received MSG solution (4. 0 mg/g) on alternate days during the first 14 days after birth, and Saline group (SAL, n = 20) which received saline solution {{for the same period}} of time and at the same dose. At 60 days of age, GluM group was ovariectomized (GluMO) and SAL group just suffered surgical stress. Subsequently, half the animals in each group started swimming, resulting in groups: sedentary saline (SALsed, n = 10), swimming saline (SALswi, n = 10), sedentary ovariectomized Glutamate (GluMOsed, n = 10) and swimming ovariecto- mized Glutamate (GluMOswi, n = 10). At the end of the experiment, we measured the ani- mals’ <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> and weight; their radius was weighed and its length measured. ResultsThe animals of the GluMOsed group had lower body weight and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> compared to SALsed. Swimming decreased body weight, but had no influence on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> of the GluMOswi group compared to GluMOsed group. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> and body weight were lower in SALswi animals compared to SALsed animals. Radius weight and length of GluMOsed animals were lower than in SALsed animals.

40|$|Based on the {{extended}} Huygens-Fresnel principle, the mutual coherence function of quasi-monochromatic electromagnetic Gaussian Schell-model (EGSM) beams propagating through turbulent atmosphere is derived analytically. By employing the lateral and the <b>longitudinal</b> coherence <b>length</b> of EGSM beams {{to characterize the}} spatial and the temporal coherence of the beams, the behavior {{of changes in the}} spatial and the temporal coherence of those beams is studied. The results show that with a fixed set of beam parameters and under particular atmospheric turbulence model, the lateral coherence of an EGSM beam reaches its maximum value as the beam propagates a certain distance in the turbulent atmosphere, then it begins degrading and keeps decreasing along with the further distance. However, the <b>longitudinal</b> coherence <b>length</b> of an EGSM beam keeps unchanging in this propagation. Lastly, a qualitative explanation is given to these results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Purpose: to verify, through pelvic ultrasound, the {{existence}} {{of changes in the}} internal genitalia of girls with central precocious puberty, submitted to treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs. Methods: pelvic ultrasound was performed in 18 girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty, before and after three months of onset of the treatment with GnRH analogs, to investigate the impact of the therapy on the internal genitalia. Ovarian and uterine volumes, uterine <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length,</b> relation between the longitudinal diameter of the uterine corpus and the uterine cervix, the relation between the anterior-posterior diameter of the uterine corpus and the uterine cervix, and endometrial echogenicity were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed through Shapiro-Willkis's test, to assess data normality. When normality was present, Student's test t was applied. For data without normality, a non-parametric test (the signal test) was used. Results: after therapy, statistically significant decline of the mean uterine volume (from 5. 4 cm 3 to 3. 0 cm 3, p< 0. 001), of the mean ovarian volume (from 2. 2 cm 3 to 1. 1 cm 3, p= 0. 004), of the mean uterine <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> (from 4. 2 cm to 3. 4 cm, p= 0. 001), and of the mean endometrial echogenicity (from 1. 8 mm to 0. 6 mm, p= 0. 018) occurred.

30|$|Another {{important}} question {{refers to the}} fact that with alternative database resources that merge into EHRs, what is the expected effects on the quality of results? Interesting evidences have appeared showing that the same drug was reported to yield conflicting significant results (decreased vs increased risk) [38]. However, a possible underestimation of heterogeneity may underlie such uncertainty. Simply pooling data or performing meta-analysis is not a best practice towards good outcomes, in particular toward causal interpretation. With large heterogeneity, what is the ability of observational data to address clinical questions? We need joint quantitative and qualitative (study-specific) evaluations. It is important to notice that EHRs originate from diverse data capture processes, mostly separated from research intentions (claims reflect reimbursement process, thus diagnosis codes). EHRs are often conceived to support clinical care, through information required by providers to perform services not medical histories.

40|$|A general {{architecture}} of an emittance exchanger (EEX) is considered, where the horizontal and longitudinal phase spaces are exchanged.

Using higher-order particle simulations, a preferred configuration is found, which has better compression capability and less emittance growth than the standard EEX design at high beam energy. An alternative design is also found which eliminates any final energy-phase coupling. Features of compression using an EEX are significantly different than with a chicane because the final longitudinal phase space is decoupled from the initial longitudinal phase space. Advantages of using an EEX for compression include less susceptibility to the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) microbunch instability, less susceptibility to bunch length broadening from CSR effects, and elimination of the initial energy-phase correlation that is needed for compression using a chicane as well as any residual energy-phase correlation after compression.

40|$|Wind {{velocity}} {{data are}} often analysed to determine gust (peak) and mean (average) statistics for design to sustain in extreme conditions and for control to monitor these extreme levels through continuous {{measurement of the}} related means {{over a period of}} time. The relationship between the gust and the mean is simply expressed as the ratio of the gust to mean wind speeds, termed as the Gust Factor, G. The shorter the averaging period for the mean, the closer of the measured mean to the gust wind speed this becomes. The gust maximum value itself would also be higher when averaged over a shorter gust duration, t, or measured with higher turbulence intensity Iu or higher <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> scale Lux. Therefore, it is important in the description of a Gust Factor to qualify the averaging duration both for gust and for mean wind speeds as well as the turbulence characteristics in the wind flow. This paper presents an analysis of wind tunnel data to relate the gust wind speed measurements and hence the Gust Factors for various averaging durations in neutral wind flow conditions of various turbulence intensities and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>length</b> scales. Some full scale wind data are also compared. The proposed relationship with respect to the hourly mean wind speed is as follows: G = 1 + 0. 075 • Iu • Lux 0. 25 • [ln(t/ 3600) ] 2 • [0. 3 + 0. 02 ln(t/ 3600) ...|$|E
