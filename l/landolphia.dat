5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from <b>Landolphia</b> owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the <b>Landolphia</b> vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Congo rubber, {{formerly}} {{a major source}} of rubber, came from vines in the genus <b>Landolphia</b> (L. kirkii, L. heudelotis, and L. owariensis).|$|E
50|$|Both {{flora and}} fauna are those {{characteristic}} of {{the greater part of}} tropical Africa. As far south as Benguela the coast region is rich in oil palms and mangroves. In {{the northern part of the}} province are dense forests. In the South towards the Kunene are regions of dense thorn scrub. Rubber vines and trees are abundant, but in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the primitive methods adopted by native collectors of rubber. The species most common are various root rubbers, notably the Carpodinus chylorrhiza. This species and other varieties of carpodinus are very widely distributed. <b>Landolphias</b> are also found. The coffee, cotton and Guinea pepper plants are indigenous, and the tobacco plant flourishes in several districts. Among the trees are several which yield excellent timber, such as the tacula (Pterocarpus tinctorius), which grows to an immense size, its wood being blood-red in colour, and the Angola mahogany. The bark of the musuemba (Albizzia coriaria) is largely used in the tanning of leather. The mulundo bears a fruit about the size of a cricket ball covered with a hard green shell and containing scarlet pips like a pomegranate.|$|R

50|$|<b>Landolphia</b> owariensis is {{a species}} of liana from the family Apocynaceae found in {{tropical}} Africa. Latex can be extracted from this plant for the manufacture of natural rubber. Other names for this vine are eta, the white rubber vine and the Congo rubber plant.|$|E
50|$|Congo rubber, {{formerly}} {{a major source}} of rubber, came from vines in the genus <b>Landolphia</b> (L. kirkii, L. heudelotis, and L. owariensis). These cannot be cultivated, and the intense drive to collect latex from wild plants was responsible for many of the atrocities committed under the Congo Free State.|$|E
5000|$|In {{modern times}} <b>Landolphia</b> owariensis Beauv., known as [...] "white rubber vine" [...] and Congo rubber, eta, or abo, is {{primarily}} used for its fruits, but occasionally for rubber band production; {{it was a}} major source for rubber from nations including Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria in the early 1900s.|$|E
50|$|There is also large {{expense of}} green grasses {{especially}} during the wet season. This supports large population of cattle and other herbivorous animals during the wet season. The common grass spp are albazia zygia, tridax precumbense, <b>landolphia</b> spp among others. During the rainy season the grasses are green but turn brownish during the dry season.|$|E
50|$|Red Kasai and Congo rubbers are {{obtained}} from the same species of vines, namely, the <b>Landolphia,</b> Owariensis Pal. Beauv., L. Gentilii De Wild and L. Droogmansiana De Wild. The difference in color, which is the chief distinction, is {{probably due to the}} different climatic conditions in the two districts, and different modes of collecting and coagulating, and not to any inherent property of the latices. <b>Landolphia</b> Klainei also gives a reddish rubber when grown under the same conditions as the above mentioned species. The red colour of the rubber appears to be accentuated more and more as the district in which the vine is cultivated is farther from the zone known as the Great Equatorial Forest. In the south of the Congo territory, for instance, latitude 7S and 8S, the india-rubber collected is almost red. In the Upper Congo the latex from these varieties is very watery, whilst in the Kasai district it is thick. In the former district it is coagulated by means of Bosanga, and in the latter it coagulates spontaneously in contact with air.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on a {{wide range}} of plants, {{including}} Adenia, Calophyllum inophyllum, Chrysophyllum viridifolium, Cola minor, Deinbollia borbonica, Diospyros kabuyeana, Diphasia, Dovyalis macrocalyx, Dracaena mannii, Flacourtia indica, Hirtella zanzibarica zanzibarica, Inhambanella henriquezii, <b>Landolphia,</b> Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius scassellatii, Lepisanthes senegalensis, Ludia mauritiana, Manilkara sansibarensis, Mimusops aedificatoria, Olea woodiana disjuncta, Oxyanthus goetzei keniensis, Rourea minor, Saba comorensis, Salacia elegans, Strychnos madagascariensis, Terminalia catappa, Toddalia asiatica, Trichilia emetica, Trilepisium madagascariense, Vepris nobilis, Ximenia caffra and Xylopia.|$|E
50|$|Among {{other common}} {{trees in the}} tidal várzea are the timber species Virola surinamensis, Cedrelinga castanaeformis, Ceiba pentandra, Calycophyllum brasiliensis and other large trees such as Ficus species, Macrolobium acaciifolium, Pachira aquatica, Symphonia globulifera, Triplaris surinamensis and Mora paraensis.The shrub Machaerium lanatum forms dense {{thickets}} {{along the banks of}} the rivers. There are large lianas in the flooded areas such as Strychnos blackii, <b>Landolphia</b> paraensis and Guatteria scandens.The ecoregion also includes seasonally flooded forest and permanently flooded igapó swamp forest.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} fifty species of <b>Landolphia</b> in {{continental}} Africa and about fourteen more species in Madagascar. They are typically found in forest habitats in tropical West and Central Africa, scrambling over trees, {{but a few}} species are large shrubs. They have simple, glossy green leaves in opposite pairs, jasmine-like flowers with tubes and parts in fives, and hard-shelled, fleshy fruits with several seeds embedded in the pulp. After fruiting, the flower stem develops into a twisting tendril which branches near its tip.|$|E
5000|$|There may be {{reports of}} limited dietary uses of plants from this family,—see however {{the section on}} {{toxicity}} above. The edible flower of Fernaldia pandurata (common name: [...] ) is a popular part of El Salvadorian and Guatemalan cooking. Carissa (Natal plum) produces an edible fruit. The genus Apocynum was reportedly used {{as a source of}} fiber by Native Americans. The aromatic fruit juice from Saba comorensis (syn. <b>Landolphia</b> comorensis, the Bungo or Mbungo fruit) is a popular drink, on Pemba Island and other parts of coastal Tanzania.|$|E
5000|$|The Lulonga Company was a {{concession}} {{company of the}} Congo Free State. [...] It was, with the Société Anversoise and the Abir Congo Company, {{one of the main}} producers of rubber in the Free State. [...] The company's rubber production declined in the early 20th century as a result of over harvesting of the natural rubber vine (<b>Landolphia</b> owariensis gentili) and the entire concession produced just seven tons of rubber in 1905. [...] Alongside Abir and the Société Anversoise the Lulonga Company handed back control of the concession to the Congo Free State in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>Landolphia</b> kirkii are oblong and {{sometimes}} ovate and can reach up to 9 cm in length. They are glossy green coloured from above, {{and have a}} channeled midrib. They have 10-12 pairs of lateral veins, with a net-veining that is slightly raised just above the midrib, that is pubescent underneath. The inflorescence has many flowers, which are white or creamy-yellow coloured and have a diameter of 1 cm. The flowers also have a tube that is 3.5 - 4 mm long. The green fruits are spherical with a diameter of 15 cm, and are edible.|$|E
50|$|The Biaka (Bayaka) and Baka pygmies of the {{northern}} Congo basin relate tales of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé, a legendary, dinosaur-like creature purportedly inhabiting the Lake Tele region of the Republic of the Congo (ROC). It is thought to feed on <b>Landolphia,</b> a type of liana. Other denizens of the ROC include moustached guenons, crowned guenons, red colobus monkeys, okapis and the blue duiker. Figs sustain great blue turacos, black mangabeys and various hornbills. The forests of Tanzania’s Gombe National Park support common chimpanzees and the bais of Dzanga-Sangha National Park in the Central African Republic support numbers of forest elephant. Other Congolese inhabitants featured include red river hogs, bongos, forest buffalo, orb-web spiders and colonial spiders. Returning again to the ROC, the Biaka are seen to expertly craft Portuguese-style crossbows and arrows made from seven different kinds of wood and other plants. Gorillas are again viewed at the Odzala National Park.|$|E
50|$|Western gorillas' diets {{are high}} in fiber, {{including}} leaves, stems, fruit, piths, flowers, bark, invertebrates, and soil. The frequency of when each of these are consumed depends on the particular gorilla group and the season. Furthermore, different groups of gorillas eat differing numbers and species of plants and invertebrates, suggesting they have a food culture. Fruit comprises most of the gorillas' diets when it is abundant, directly influencing their foraging and ranging patterns. Fruits of the genera Tetrapleura, Chrysophyllum, Dialium, and <b>Landolphia</b> are favored by the gorillas. Low-quality herbs, such as leaves and woody vegetation, are only eaten when fruit is scarce. In the dry season from January to March, when fleshy fruits {{are few and far}} between, more fibrous vegetation such as the leaves and bark of the low-quality herbs Palisota and Aframomum are consumed. Of the invertebrates consumed by the gorillas, termites and ants make up the majority. Caterpillars, grubs, and larvae are also consumed in rarity.|$|E
50|$|When {{growing in}} savannah, <b>Landolphia</b> owariensis is an erect bush or small tree, but when growing among trees, it can {{develop into a}} woody vine with a stem that grows to a metre wide and 100 m long. The bark is rough, dark brown or greyish-brown, and often covered with pale yellow lenticels; it exudes a milky juice when damaged. The leaves grow in {{opposite}} pairs and are oblong, elliptical or obovate, up to 25 by 12 cm. The young leaves are reddish at first but the upper sides of the leaf blades later become dark green and glossy, with a pale midrib. The flowers are in terminal panicles. The peduncles and calyx lobes are clad in brown hairs, and the corolla tube and lobes are yellowish, pinkish or white. The flowers are followed by rounded, wrinkled fruit resembling oranges. These are juicy and slightly acid when ripe, with usually three seeds surrounded by soft, edible pulp.|$|E
