5|$|One Supreme Court lawyer {{alleged that}} his elderly mother was harassed {{by members of}} staff and she {{collapsed}} and suffered a <b>laceration</b> on her chin. Among others, a member of staff in-charge at the airport {{was reported to have}} told him to go do whatever he could.|$|E
5|$|During the event, five wrestlers {{suffered}} legitimate injuries. Randy Orton dislocated {{his shoulder}} while Ted DiBiase suffered a concussion, {{and although they}} both appeared on Raw the following night, they did not wrestle. CM Punk required 13 staples to close the wound in his forehead he sustained during his match with Mysterio. Batista suffered a back and tailbone injury during his match with John Cena, who himself suffered a <b>laceration</b> and lost a tooth.|$|E
5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial <b>laceration.</b> Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{legislation}} requiring deposits for beverage containers on the incidence of <b>lacerations</b> in urban children. Records of emergency room visits for <b>lacerations</b> and fractures were reviewed for three years pre-legislation (1980 - 82) and the immediate post-legislation period (1983). The incidence of total sutured <b>lacerations</b> did not change substantially after the legislation, but glass-related <b>lacerations</b> fell by 60 per cent, due to a reduced incidence in <b>lacerations</b> occurring outside of the home...|$|R
5000|$|Pistol {{whipping}} {{may leave}} unusual <b>lacerations</b> {{on the body}} of the injured due to various protruding details of the pistol. [...] When blows are struck using the butt of the weapon rather than its barrel or flank semicircular or triangular <b>lacerations</b> on the skin may be produced. The magazine well at the bottom of an automatic pistol and its surrounding base produce rectangular <b>lacerations</b> on the skin. These <b>lacerations</b> can vary in depth and severity, but [...] "whipped" [...] fractures are common.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the incidence of cervical <b>lacerations</b> with cerclage removal planned before labor compared to after the onset of labor by a systematic review of published studies. STUDY DESIGN: Searches were performed in electronic databases from inception of each database to November 2014. We identified all studies reporting the rate of cervical <b>lacerations</b> and the timing of cerclage removal (either before or after the onset of labor). The primary outcome was the incidence of spontaneous and clinically significant intrapartum cervical <b>lacerations</b> (i. e. <b>lacerations</b> requiring suturing). RESULTS: Six studies, which met the inclusion criteria, were included in the analysis. The overall incidence of cervical <b>lacerations</b> was 8. 9...|$|R
5|$|In the 2009â€“10 season, Yi {{returned}} to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a <b>laceration</b> on his upper lip on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, {{as well as a}} 40% shooting percentage from the field and 37% on three-point field goals.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: <b>laceration,</b> avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The <b>laceration</b> may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
30|$|On contrast-enhanced CT images, splenic <b>lacerations</b> mostly present {{themselves}} as ill-defined, irregular, geographic hypodense areas within the spleen {{due to a}} lack of perfusion with contrast material. <b>Lacerations</b> can be located anywhere in the spleen (i.e. centrally, close to the hilum, subcapsular). On non-contrast-enhanced CT images, the density of <b>lacerations</b> is usually higher than the density of the normal spleen due to haemorrhage. Large <b>lacerations</b> or intraparenchymal haematomas can cause a mass effect, which is also responsible for clinical symptoms including left upper quadrant pain.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{a study to}} evaluate the tensile properties of partial tendon <b>lacerations</b> {{and the effects of}} peripheral sutures on the tendon strength. Seventy-two fresh pig flexor digitorum profundus tendons were divided equally into eight groups. Tendons in four of the groups were subjected to partial <b>lacerations</b> (60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 90 %) and were not repaired. In the other four similar groups partial <b>lacerations</b> were repaired with running peripheral sutures. The tendons were subjected to load-to-failure tests in an Instron tensile machine to determine the initial, 1 mm, 2 mm gap formation forces and the ultimate strength. The tendons with <b>lacerations</b> of 80 % and 90 % had a remarkably lower tensile strength than those 60 % and 70 % <b>lacerations.</b> Running peripheral sutures increased the gap formation forces and the ultimate strength of all the tendons, though particularly those with 80 % and 90 % <b>lacerations...</b>|$|R

5|$|On September 26, 2006, Holly {{received}} 24 stitches from WWE Doctor Ferdinand Rios in {{his back}} after suffering a severe <b>laceration</b> during an Extreme Rules match against Rob Van Dam when he landed on the metal railing of a table he was suplexing Van Dam {{out of the ring}} and through during an ECW show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Holly obtained the injury early in the match but continued to wrestle until the match's conclusion when he was pinned. After the match, as he was being helped out of the ring, he received a standing ovation from fans. The legitimate incident caused fans to cheer Holly in the following weeks, leading him to become a face character and a feud with Paul Heyman's other enforcer Test. His second to latest run as a face was short lived as he eventually turned on Rob Van Dam when they were partners in a tag match.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal <b>laceration.</b> In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|At the OVW tapings on May 10, Kennedy {{returned}} to in-ring action facing the Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, in a title match that Kennedy {{was unable to}} win. Kennedy made his return to SmackDown! on the June 9 episode with a victory over Scotty 2 Hotty after using the Kenton Bomb. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, Matt Hardy used a roll-up to defeat Kennedy, ending Kennedy's streak of never being defeated by pin or submission. On the July 21 episode of SmackDown!, Batista put out an open challenge to find an opponent for The Great American Bash, as his original opponent, Mark Henry, had been injured. Kennedy accepted the challenge and won the match by disqualification, however, he suffered a severe injury during the match after being thrown headfirst into the steel steps, resulting in an exposed cranium <b>laceration</b> which required twenty stitches to close. He then entered into a short feud with Batista, defeating him by countout in their second match, but losing via pinfall in the third. Kennedy helped The McMahons (Vince and Shane) in their feud with D-Generation X (DX), appearing at both SummerSlam and the August 28 episode of Raw to attack DX.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the risk factors of third- and fourth-degree <b>lacerations</b> following vaginal deliveries in Taiwanese women, and to offer clinical guidance for the reduction of severe perineal <b>lacerations.</b> Materials and methods: A total of 1879 women who underwent vaginal deliveries assisted by midline episiotomy at a tertiary hospital were included. Obstetric risk factors were analyzed for women with and without third- and fourth-degree <b>lacerations.</b> Results: Two hundred and five deliveries (10. 9 %) resulted in third- or fourth-degree <b>lacerations.</b> Parity, duration of first and second stages of labor, rate of instrument-assisted vaginal deliveries, the newborn's birth weight and head circumference, and the ratio of the newborn's birth weight to maternal body mass index were significantly different between women with and without severe perineal <b>lacerations.</b> Logistic regression demonstrated that nulliparity (odds ratioÂ =Â  3. 626, pÂ <Â  0. 001), duration of second stage of labor (odds ratioÂ =Â  1. 102, pÂ =Â  0. 044), instrument-assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratioÂ =Â  4. 102, pÂ <Â  0. 001), and newborn's head circumference (odds ratioÂ =Â  1. 323, pÂ <Â  0. 001) were independent risk factors of severe perineal <b>lacerations.</b> Instrument-assisted vaginal delivery was a common independent risk factor for severe <b>lacerations</b> shared between primiparous and multiparous women. Conclusions: With regard to severe perineal <b>lacerations</b> during vaginal delivery, there are multiple obstetric contributory factors despite routine episiotomy, among them, nulliparity, longer labor duration, greater newborn head circumference, and instrument-assisted vaginal delivery. The latter should only be performed after careful evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{uncomplicated}} skin <b>lacerations</b> {{who attended}} a rural family-practice clinic {{were randomly assigned to}} have their cut repaired using either full sterile technique or a surgically-clean technique. No significant differences were found in the rate of healing or in the incidence of complications. It was concluded that full sterile technique is not needed to repair simple skin <b>lacerations,</b> and that to suture the <b>lacerations</b> using a surgically clean technique would save both time and money...|$|R
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the <b>laceration</b> {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|The Combine use a large {{array of}} science fiction technology. They have access to {{teleportation}} technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause <b>laceration</b> injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves {{into the air and}} detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} St. Ambrose Hospital {{chief of staff}} Charlotte King (KaDee Strickland) hiding in a supply closet after being raped in her office. Alternative-medicine {{specialist}} Dr. Pete Wilder (Tim Daly) finds and examines her, diagnosing a broken wrist, eye socket and nose and a deep arm <b>laceration,</b> and admits her to the hospital. King lies to Wilder, telling {{him that she was}} injured in a mugging. Wilder calls the police; King attempts to contact her boyfriend, Dr. Cooper Freedman (Paul Adelstein), but cannot reach him because he is out drinking with Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) and Dr. Sam Bennett (Taye Diggs). At the police station psychiatrist Sheldon Wallace (Brian Benben) interrogates Lee McHenry (Nicholas Brendon), who was found with blood on his clothes. After nurses photograph King's injuries, Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) realizes that King was raped and offers her a rape kit. During her pelvic examination, King refuses the rape kit and tells Montgomery not to tell anyone else about the rape. Freedman arrives with Shepherd and Bennett, and is surprised at the extent of King's injuries. During the CT scan, King and Shepherd bond over their shared drug addiction when King refuses pain medication. Shepherd admits drinking alcohol again, and King offers to take her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Shepherd sutures King's wounds, which causes King great pain; Freedman feels powerless, unable to protect her.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{if there is an}} association between BMI and 3 rd- or 4 th-degree perineal <b>lacerations</b> in normal spontaneous and operative vaginal deliveries. Study Design. We performed a retrospective case control study using a large obstetric quality improvement database over a six-year period. Cases were identified as singleton gestations with third- and fourth-degree <b>lacerations.</b> Controls were obtained randomly from the database of patients without third- or fourth-degree <b>lacerations</b> in a 1 [*]:[*] 1 ratio. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results. Of 32, 607 deliveries, 22, 011 (67. 5 %) charts with BMI documented were identified. Third- or fourth-degree <b>lacerations</b> occurred in 2. 74 % (n= 605) of patients. 37 % (n= 223) were identified in operative vaginal deliveries. In the univariate analysis, obesity, older maternal age, non-Asian race, and birth weight < 4000 [*]g were all protective against 3 rd- and 4 th-degree <b>lacerations.</b> After controlling for age, race, mode of vaginal delivery, and birth weight, obesity remained significant. Conclusion. Being obese may protect against third- and fourth-degree <b>lacerations</b> independent of parity, race, birth weight, and mode of delivery...|$|R

5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12â€“15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a <b>laceration</b> on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

40|$|Distal limb <b>lacerations</b> {{are common}} {{injuries}} in horses, {{with a better}} prognosis reported for extensor tendons <b>lacerations</b> compared to flexor tendons <b>lacerations.</b> The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the influence of type and location of injury, modalities of treatment and post surgical complications on the outcome of extensor tendon <b>lacerations.</b> The medical records of 156 horses surgically treated for extensor tendon <b>lacerations</b> over a 10 -year period were analysed retrospectively. Information was obtained for 124 horses with a minimum of 18 months follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed on 129 horses (five horses were euthanatized during hospitalization) in order to determine factors affecting outcome. Seventy-four percent of the horses returned to soundness, 17 % had moderate gait impairment and 9 % remained lame. Approximately 60 % of the sports horses returned to an equal or higher level of performance, and 17. 5 % returned to a lower level. In the multivariate statistical analysis, the only significant factor that favourably influenced outcome was complete suture of the wound. A significant association could not be detected between outcome and absence of a functional extensor tendon, The most important post-surgical complication was extensive scarring of the wound. The present results report outcome of extensor tendon <b>lacerations</b> in a large number of horses and outline the importance of primary wound healing in order to ovoid major scarring with potential functional consequences...|$|R
