50|$|<b>Lampworking</b> {{is a type}} of glasswork where a torch or lamp is {{primarily}} used to melt the glass. Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. It is also known as flameworking or torchworking, as the modern practice no longer uses oil-fueled lamps. Although lack of a precise definition for <b>lampworking</b> makes it difficult to determine when this technique was first developed, the earliest verifiable lampworked glass is probably a collection of beads thought to date to the fifth century BC. <b>Lampworking</b> became widely practiced in Murano, Italy in the 14th century. In the mid 19th century lampwork technique was extended to the production of paperweights, primarily in France, where it became a popular art form, still collected today. <b>Lampworking</b> differs from glassblowing in that glassblowing uses a furnace as the primary heat source, although torches are also used.|$|E

5000|$|Borosilicate (or [...] "boro", as it {{is often}} called) is used {{extensively}} in the glassblowing process lampworking; the glassworker uses a burner torch to melt and form glass, {{using a variety of}} metal and graphite tools to shape it.

50|$|Early <b>lampworking</b> {{was done}} in the flame of an oil lamp, with the artist blowing air into the flame through a pipe. Most artists today use torches that burn either propane or natural gas, or in some {{countries}} butane, for the fuel gas, mixed with either air or pure oxygen as the oxidizer. Many hobbyists use MAPP gas in portable canisters for fuel and some use oxygen concentrators as a source of continuous oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, {{dichroic}} {{glass is}} being used to produce high-end art beads. Dichroic glass has a thin film of metal fused {{to the surface of the}} glass, resulting in a surface that has a metallic sheen that changes between two colors when viewed at different angles. Beads can be pressed, or made with traditional <b>lampworking</b> techniques. If the glass is kept in the flame too long, the metallic coating will turn silver and burn off.|$|E
5000|$|Beads can be sandblasted, or {{they can}} be faceted, using {{lapidary}} techniques. [...] "Furnace glass" [...] beads, which are more elaborate versions of the old Seed bead technique, are widely made today. Chevron beads are multi-layer beads once exclusively made using hot-shop techniques to produce the original tubing; but now some lampworkers make similar designs on their torches before lapping the ends to reveal the various layered colors. As torches get bigger and more powerful, the cross-over between <b>lampworking</b> and furnace glass continues to increase.|$|E
5000|$|Effetre glass (pronounced [...] , Italian F3, {{abbreviated}} form of fratelli tre, [...] "three brothers"), {{once known}} as Moretti glass, {{is a kind of}} glass used in <b>lampworking.</b> It is considered a medium-soft glass and is popular because of its wide range of colors and the ease with which it is molded and shaped when hot.

50|$|Most lampworkers use rods {{of glass}} 7-8 mm in diameter, though pre-made {{stringers}} {{are available in}} 1-3 mm sizes, or rods of 15 mm or more. Sheet glass can be cut with tools into strips, though {{it is easier to}} manipulate if attached to a rod first. Glass is also available in particles of various sizes (frit or powder), which is typically used for surface decorations in lampworked beads. Many manufacturers who once only sold their glass in sheet or very thick rod now provide rods for <b>lampworking</b> use. Window glass is usually not used, as it is not formulated for flameworking and there is little variation of color available.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{resurgence}} of <b>lampworking</b> as a technique to make handmade glass beads, borosilicate has become a popular material in many glass artists' studios. Borosilicate for beadmaking comes in thin, pencil-like rods. Northstar, Trautman Art Glass, Glass Alchemy and Momka's Glass are popular manufacturers, although there are other brands available. The metals used to color borosilicate glass, particularly silver, often create strikingly beautiful and unpredictable results when melted in an oxygen-gas torch flame. Because it is more shock-resistant and stronger than soft glass, borosilicate is particularly suited for pipe making, as well as sculpting figures and creating large beads. The tools used for making glass beads from borosilicate glass {{are the same as}} those used for making glass beads from soft glass.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lampworking</b> can be {{done with}} many types of glass, but the most common are {{soda-lime}} glass and lead glass, both called [...] "soft glass," [...] and borosilicate glass, often called [...] "hard glass." [...] Leaded glass tubing was commonly used in the manufacture of neon signs, and many USA lampworkers used it in making blown work. Some colored glass tubing that was also used in the neon industry was used to make small colored blown work, and colored glass rod, of compatible lead and soda-lime glasses, was used to ornament both clear and colored tubing. The use of soft glass tubing has been fading due, somewhat, to environmental concerns and health risks, but mainly due to the adoption of borosilicate glass by most lampworkers, especially since colored glasses compatible with clear borosilicate were developed.|$|E
50|$|Most Murano beads {{are made}} using an air pump burner <b>lampworking</b> or torch and mandrel technique. Once the mandrel {{was made by}} using an iron rod covered with a release {{material}} stuck {{on the top of}} the rod; now a copper tube has taken its place. The copper tube helps make many other different shapes. The lamp-work method is the most time-consuming method of glass bead-making, as each bead must be formed individually. Using a torch for heat, Murano glass rods and tubes are heated to a molten state and wrapped around a metal rod until the desired shape is achieved. Several layers of different colored glass, as well as gold and silver leaf, are used to produce the desired effect. After the bead is slowly cooled, it is removed from the rod, resulting in a hole for eventual stringing as jewelry.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the wound glass beadmaking technique, and a labor-intensive one, is what is {{traditionally}} called <b>lampworking.</b> In the Venetian industry, where very large quantities of beads were produced in the 19th century for the African trade, {{the core of a}} decorated bead was produced from molten glass at furnace temperatures, a large-scale industrial process dominated by men. The delicate multicolored decoration was then added by people, mostly women, working at home using an oil lamp or spirit lamp to re-heat the cores and the fine wisps of colored glass used to decorate them. These workers were paid on a piecework basis for the resulting lampwork beads. Modern lampwork beads are made by using a gas torch to heat a rod of glass and spinning the resulting thread around a metal rod covered in bead release. When the base bead has been formed, other colors of glass can be added to the surface to create many designs. After this initial stage of the beadmaking process, the bead can be further fired in a kiln to make it more durable.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, English {{metallurgist}} John Burton {{brought his}} hobby of hand-mixing metallic oxides into borosilicate glass to Los Angeles. Burton began a glass workshop at Pepperdine College, with instructor Margaret Youd. A {{few of the}} students in the classes, including Suellen Fowler, discovered that a specific combination of oxides made a glass that would shift from amber to purples and blues, depending on the heat and flame atmosphere. Fowler shared this combination with Paul Trautman, who formulated the first small-batch colored borosilicate recipes. He then founded Northstar Glassworks in the mid-1980s, the first factory in the world devoted solely to producing colored borosilicate glass rods and tubes for use by artists in the flame. Trautman also developed the techniques and technology to make the small-batch colored boro that is used by a number of similar companies. By the time Trautman sold Northstar in 2002, he had composed hundreds of his own recipes for colored borosilicate that are still in production today. In 2004, Trautman came back to making glass, founding Trautman Art Glass. At TAG he developed a number of newer colors that are also industry standards for the boro art community. Fowler continues to teach <b>lampworking</b> and hand-mixing of color in the [...] "Burton style" [...] around the US and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Mdina Glass is a {{manufacturer}} of glassware, based in Malta. It was founded in 1968 by Michael Harris, a lecturer in industrial glass design at the Royal College of Art.Attracted by various government incentives offered by newly independent Malta, Eric Dobson and Michael Harris (Royal College of Art colleagues) ventured out to Mediterranean island from the UK {{with the aim of}} opening Malta's first ever glassware manufacturer. The company, Maltese Glass Industries (which soon changed to Mdina Glass), became an active glassmaking company in 1968.Mdina Glass was an instant success and soon the company was taking on local trainees to learn the craft. One of these trainees was Joseph Said, quickly impressing Harris and Dobson with his natural abilities in glassmaking. In 1971, two Italian maestros, the father and son team of Vincente and Ettore Boffo joined Mdina Glass to introduce Italian glassmaking techniques.Following independence from the UK in 1964, the Maltese government offered incentives for skilled workers and entrepreneurs from outside the island, in order to build up the industrial and commercial sectors of the economy. This included a 10-year tax holiday.Due to personal reasons, Harris left Mdina Glass in 1973, leaving Eric Dobson alone at the helm and by 1975, once promising trainee Joseph Said had climbed the ranks to become the company’s Production Manager, acting as a catalyst for a number of changes, revolutionising the way the company operated and what it produced.At the end of 1967 Harris and Eric Dobson, another lecturer from the RCA, imported glassmaking equipment to Malta, and set up Maltese Glass Industries.In 1985 Eric Dobson chose to relinquish control of Mdina Glass and return to the UK. The company wasn’t doing as well as it had done in previous years. Joseph Said took over and, under his control, the company went through some quick changes to remedy the commercial situation in challenging times.Said’s influence was evident by 1987 when Mdina Glass won the International Award for Tradition and Prestige in Brussels.Two years later, Mdina Glass presented a glass sculpture to the Maltese Prime Minister to commemorate the Bush - Gorbechev Malta summit. In 1992, the company won the Malta Achievement in Industry Award.Further significant changes in glassmaking techniques, production processes and product range marked the 1990s. Basic raw materials were changed for those of a much higher quality. In 1990, Mdina Glass introduced <b>lampworking</b> techniques to Malta, and by 1995 its artisans were also honing their skills in applying the newly introduced fusion techniques to a whole new range of products.Harris trained a number of Maltese nationals as glassmakers, employing around 15 people when the firm became established. His first apprentice, Joseph Said, took over Mdina Glass (as it became known) after Harris left in 1973.Joseph Said’s children Olivia, Nevise, Pamela and Alan now form {{an integral part of the}} company, which employs around 50 people, from glassmakers, sales staff in the various outlets and administration. Olivia Said now holds the position of Production and Product Design Manager and has shown her passion for the craft by expanding the company’s range even further.In 2012 Mdina Glass was invited to participate in an exhibition at Harrods, London entitled ‘This Is Malta’. Mdina Glass has also won the National Artisan Award over two consecutive years.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{from the perspective}} of an artist working with glass and <b>lampworking</b> techniques. <b>Lampworking</b> involves working with prepared glass tubes and canes which are heated {{with the aid of a}} gas burner and shaped with small pincers. This art-based project offers an example of an artist attempt to integrate what might be termed ‘Chinese’ and ‘Western’ <b>lampworking</b> approaches. Through the creation of artworks this project offers a model of artistic practice using <b>lampworking</b> which forms a counterpoint to the more common kilnformed approach currently prevalent in China. In addition, the artworks that form part of this PhD submission are examples of a current interest amongst some Chinese artists in combining inspiration, commentary and experiences from ‘East’ and ‘West’ into their practice. This project details and contextualizes examples of how <b>lampworking</b> might be used as a medium to this end. ‘Craft’ objects are used as a starting point to develop artworks that highlight what I personally found to be diminishing aspects of Chinese culture; for example the Chinese notion of ‘Change’. This project offers a new body of lampworked artworks which have been exhibited in professional venues at a national level and that demonstrate an artist’s approach to combining aspects of Chinese and Western culture in glass art. The themes, inspiration and making process of the creative works are documented in a written thesis to form a model on which other artists might build. The recent history of Chinese <b>lampworking</b> (1930 - 2013) is presented, building on interviews and literature review of works not previously published in English. The emergence of <b>lampworking</b> in China as a medium for studio glass practice is also charted. For Western audiences, this research offers an example of how the inspirations from Chinese culture and philosophy have been incorporated into contemporary glass art. It also clarifies the current situation of contemporary Chinese <b>lampworking.</b> For Chinese audiences, this research is an instance of western art influence in Chinese <b>lampworking</b> practice.

40|$|This is practice-based {{research}} about glass art, undertaken by an artist specialising in the <b>lampworking</b> technique. Over many centuries, <b>lampworking</b> {{has been widely}} used for scientific, industrial and craft purposes. In the early 1990 s, there was a notable shift where traditional <b>lampworking</b> began merging with contemporary glass art, {{but there is still}} room for further development. The research focus is line-making through <b>lampworking.</b> Building upon Hoyt (1989), who determined the fundamental procedures in <b>lampworking,</b> this research identifies five operations relating to line-making: ‘bending’, ‘stretching’, ‘thickening’, ‘adding’ and ‘tooling’. Before this research, these techniques were already well practised in traditional lampwork training. However, they were recognised as only basics to construct larger pieces, and line-making itself did not gain real attention. Neither has the theoretical concept of making lines in glass been discussed enough. This research re-examines each of these operations and searches for dormant possibilities to exploit for artistic expression. The significance of glass lines is discussed in comparison to other line-making techniques and media in visual art. The taxonomy of lines advocated by Ingold (2007) is referred to as a guide for deeper exploration in this field. The investigation highlights the unique material feature of glass and contributes the idea of ’spatial traces’ and ‘projected lines’ to the discussion. A series of artworks is subsequently made to demonstrate and evaluate the research outcomes. The particular innovation generated by this research is the development of ‘calligraphic lampworking’, which is technically an extension of the ‘stretching’ operation. The act of stretching molten glass is observed to be comparable to ink calligraphy, in that they both leave a trace of movement. The distinctive difference is that the strokes of calligraphic <b>lampworking</b> are spatially liberated, whereas those of ink calligraphy are confined to the plane of a two-dimensional surface. The ‘multi-dimensionality’ of glass lines is also theoretically explored and discussed in terms of the glass’s clarity, reflections and shadows...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{understand}} how antimonate opacifying crystals were obtained throughout history. Two archaeological glass productions opacified with calcium and lead antimonates are studied in this paper, in order to rediscover ancient opaque glass technologies: Roman mosaic tesserae (1 st cent. B. C. - 4 th cent. A. D.) and Nevers <b>lampworking</b> glass (18 th cent. A. D.). The fine examination of crystalline phases and of the vitreous matrix is undertaken using various and complementary techniques. Results are compared with a modern reference production, for which the technological process is well known. We demonstrate that Ca-antimonate opacifiers in Roman mosaic tesserae, as well as in Nevers <b>lampworking</b> glass, were obtained by in situ crystallization. Nevertheless, Roman and Nevers glass would have undergone different firing processes. We propose that the addition of previously synthesized crystals or the use of "anime" could be the process used to obtain Pb-antimonate opacified glass, for both productions studied. We demonstrate that CaO, PbO and Sb 2 O 3 concentrations in the bulk compositions and in the matrices, and their evolution with the crystallinity ratio, offer robust criteria for the distinction of the opacification process used. Also, the different crystalline structures help to provide information on the experimental condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and create a process for manufacturing replacement glass prisms for the Piedras Blancas lighthouse and several other lighthouses nationwide. The prisms were designed to be in multiple metal arrays spread across {{the floor of the}} beacon room (the topmost room of the lighthouses). The prisms functioned to transmit extra, radiant light from the beacon light through the floor of the beacon room and disperse it into the maintenance room below. Using computer aided drafting (CAD) software, an original prism was measured and modeled; the corresponding mold was also modeled. G-codes for controlling the movement of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill were created to machine the two halves of the mold. A donated block of graphite was machined according to the developed G-codes. As a proof of concept method for casting these prisms, I used a <b>lampworking</b> setup – consisting of a propane-oxygen torch, the associated hoses, regulators, and tanks, an annealing kiln, and the necessary <b>lampworking</b> tools – to melt one end of a borosilicate glass rod into a large gather of molten glass. I forced this gather into the mold, thereby filling the mold, and allowed the glass to solidify. Then I opened the mold, removed the prism, melted off the extra rod, and flattened the top face of the prism. This method, although suitable for the proof of concept, will not be efficient for casting the needed quantity of prisms due to the additional, time consuming steps required. For producing large quantities of these prisms, suggested future work may involve pouring molten glass into the mold via the use of a crucible...|$|E
40|$|Fire and {{inspiration}} melted glass art’s enchanting ways {{into the center}} of my passions. <b>Lampworking</b> is a small-scale method of glass blowing, which is the term to refer to an art form where one shapes molten glass into a variety of items. To create glass art, propane and oxygen supply a flame torch which melts the glass. Gravity and rhythmic hands work symbiotically to shape glass rods and tubes. The result is unique three-dimensional visual art. After years of aspiring to work with borosilicate glass, the opportunity to incorporate the endeavor with academia presented itself. Through months of time and dedication, I was able to connect glass art with psychology by monitoring and recording the learning curve of a novice lampworker. Simply defined, a learning curve is a graphical representation of the increase of Learning or Proficiency (Vertical axis) with Experience (Horizontal axis.) Beginning with my first time using a torch, I kept a journal of my daily experiences, advancements, and accomplishments over the course of 14 weeks. This journal allowed me to observe the increase of knowledge and skills gained over time. Photographic and physical items were collected to provide a visual display of <b>lampworking</b> progress. To conclude my observation period, I constructed a final piece of psychology-inspired artwork that incorporated my highest levels of skills at the time. This project inspired me to question and observe some of the psychological processes related to art creation. It allowed me to discover and immerse myself in a mental state of flow, which involves full-capacity engagement in a goal-driven task. Tranquility, focus, challenge-skill balance, and control are some factors that accompany the flow of glasswork. The project also provided me with the basic skills I need to become an advanced glassworker. Through my involvement, I have acquired a true grasp on the value of working with one’s hands...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} cross-cultural approaches to contemporary Western glass Jewellery design {{by using the}} Chinese philosophical notion of ‗harmony between man and nature‘ on glass and metal jewellery. By analysing the principle of ‗harmony between man and nature‘, new approaches are developed. This is achieved by using cross-cultural practices, 3 D prototyping techniques and glass studio practices to create glass jewellery designs. The methodologies include: philosophical methodology and experimental research. Tacit knowledge drawn from previous experience is deployed to encourage experimentation with materials and the ways they are used in glass and jewellery practices. The research also utilises Chinese ‗holistic approaches‘, such as ‗harmony‘, ‗balance‘, ‗flexibility‘ and ‗change‘ to glass and jewellery making and the resulting aesthetics provide new practical strategies and contemporary glass jewellery designs. By analysing Chinese culture and traditions I have facilitated six case studies which explore philosophical understandings through studio practice including the following six philosophical approaches: ‗Integration of Yin and Yang‘, ‗Unification of Time and Space‘, ‗Same Structure of Man and Nature‘, ‗the Concept of Change‘, ‗Self-cognition and External-cognition‘ and ‗Combination of Subject and Object‘. Case studies are also used to examine personal approaches to studio practice using Chinese paintings and interpreting them into 3 D designs and glass jewellery.
