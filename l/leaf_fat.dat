40|$|Adipose {{genes are}} {{potential}} candidates for meat quality. In the present study, two ESTs, coding for ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACL) and Adipose Differentiation-Related Protein (ADRP) gene were isolated via mRNA differential display technique. A C/T SNP in the 5 ’-flanking region of ACL gene and an insertion/deletion mutation {{in the fourth}} intron of ADRP gene were found, respectively. The selected pigs were genotyped at porcine ACL XhoI-RFLP and ADRPinsertion/deletion mutation. The {{results showed that the}} ACL genotypes presented a significant effect on <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> weight (p< 0. 01), caul fat weight (p< 0. 05), pH (LD) (p< 0. 01) and water holding capacity (p< 0. 05). Moreover, this site seemed to be significantly dominant in action (p< 0. 01 for <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> weight, caul fat weight and pH (LD); p< 0. 05 for water holding capacity) and allele B was associated with increase of both leaf and caul fat weights whereas with decrease of meat pH of Longissimus Dorsi and water holding capacity. The ADRP genotypes showed significance both on <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> weight and water moisture (p< 0. 05). The additive effects were significant for these traits while allele D increased the traits' phenotypic values.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was designed using 30 Yorkshire pigs {{to study the}} influence of slaughter weight and feed restriction on carcass cut-out data and to relate these physical measurements to the chemically-determined proximate components. As slaughter weight increased from 79 to 102 kg., the percent of all lean cuts decreased significantly, while that of fat cuts and back-fat thickness increased significantly. Absolute amounts of both fat and lean cuts increased with slaughter weight. Feed restriction significantly increased most of the lean parameters studied and reduced the fat measurements. It increased percent of head and reduced the percent of offal (gastrointestinal tract minus contents, head, respiratory tract and all other internal organs). Correlations between <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> and empty body weight and between <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> and carcass extractable fat were higher than between back fat and the same parameters. Therefore, <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> {{may be a more}} satisfactory index of true body fat than is back fat, although the best index still is the carcass extractable fat, for which the correlation with the empty body fat was 0. 99. The offal proximate chemical components were highly correlated with those of the carcass and the empty body. A knowledge of the chemical composition of the offal alone is, therefore, a good reflection of the chemical composition of the empty body. Percent of extractable fat in the empty body, carcass, or offal were positively correlated with fat measures and negatively correlated with all lean measures and with the protein and water. Percents of water and protein were positively correlated with the lean parameters and negatively correlated with all fat characteristics. The saturated fatty acids were positively related to all fat measures and to average daily gain and gross energy of the body and negatively correlated with all lean measures and water and protein. The reverse was true for the unsaturated fatty acids. Also, some strong inverse relationships were found between some unsaturated and saturated fatty acids. The chilled dressing percent was poorly correlated with nearly all physical and chemical measures and, therefore, should not be regarded as a satisfactory index of physical or chemical parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} diet {{supplemented}} with red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) leaf on antioxidant status of plasma and tissue {{was investigated in}} C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The mice were randomly {{divided into two groups}} after one-week acclimation, and fed a high fat (20 %) and high cholesterol (1 %) diet without (control group) or with 8 % freeze-dried red beet leaf (RBL group) for 4 weeks. In RBL mice, lipid peroxidation determined as 2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS value) was significantly reduced in the plasma and selected organs (liver, heart, and kidney). Levels of antioxidants (glutathione and β-carotene) and the activities of antioxidant enzyme (glutathione peroxidase) in plasma and liver were considerably increased, suggesting that antioxidant defenses were improved by RBL diet. Comet parameters such as tail DNA (%), tail extent moment, olive tail moment and tail length were significantly reduced by 25. 1 %, 49. 4 %, 35. 4 %, and 23. 7 %, respectively, in plasma lymphocyte DNA of RBL mice compared with control mice, and indicated the increased resistance of lymphocyte DNA to oxidative damage. In addition, the RBL diet controlled body weight together with a significant reduction of fat pad (retroperitoneal, epididymal, inguinal fat, and total fat). Therefore, the present study suggested that the supplementation of 8 % red beet <b>leaf</b> in high <b>fat</b> high cholesterol diet could prevent lipid peroxidation and improve antioxidant defense system in the plasma and tissue of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To analyse the {{phytochemical}} {{contents of}} leaf, stem bark and root of Jatropha curcas (J.  curcas) in four solvent extracts and their proximate and mineral compositions. Methods: Standard analytical procedures {{were used for}} the determination of phytochemicals, proximate and mineral compositions of the leaf, stem bark and root extracts of J.  curcas. Results: Results of the analysis showed the presence of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, coumarins, saponins, terpenoids, steroids, triterpenoid saponins, carotenoids, phlobatannins and tannins in the leaf, stem bark and root of all the solvent extracts. Flavonoids were present in the highest amount in the ethyl acetate extracts of the leaf (7. 35 % ±  0. 02 %), stem bark (4. 12 % ±  0. 01 %) and root (3. 35 % ±  0. 02 %) followed by polyphenols in the methanol extracts of leaf (4. 62 % ±  0. 02 %), stem bark (2. 77 % ±  0. 05 %) and root (2. 49 % ±  0. 02 %). Poly-acetylated compounds were absent in all the solvent extracts of the leaf, stem bark and root. However, some anti-nutritional agents such as oxalates, phytates and cyanates were present in all the solvent extracts of the leaf, stem bark and root except the ethyl acetate. Phytates were high in the aqueous solvent of the leaf (6. 12 % ±  0. 00 %) but low in the stem bark (1. 00 % ±  0. 05 %) and root (0. 89 % ±  0. 03 %). Proximate composition showed appreciable amounts of total carbohydrate (36. 33 % ±  0. 72 %), crude protein (26. 00 % ±  0. 47 %) and reducing sugars (5. 87 % ±  0. 14 %) in the <b>leaf,</b> while crude <b>fat</b> was more in the stem bark (16. 70 % ±  0. 30 %). There was corresponding substantial energy in the leaf [(1514. 77  ±  20. 87) kJ/ 100  g] and stem bark [(907. 00  ±  8. 52) kJ/ 100  g]. Moisture and ash contents of the leaf, stem bark and root were within acceptable limits for the use in drugs formulation. The mineral composition showed substantial amounts of important elements such as Fe, Ca, Na, Mg and Zn. Others were P, K and Se. Conclusions: The outcome of this study suggests that the leaf, stem bark and root of J.  curcas have very good medicinal potentials, meet the standard requirements for drug formulation and serve as good sources of energy and nutrients except for the presence of some anti-nutritional elements predominant in the leaf...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} trait locus (QTL) analysis of carcass composition data from a three-generation experimental cross between Meishan (MS) and Large White (LW) pig breeds is presented. A total of 488 F 2 males issued from six F 1 boars and 23 F 1 sows, the progeny of six LW boars and six MS sows, were slaughtered at approximately 80 kg live weight and were submitted to a standardised cutting of the carcass. Fifteen traits, i. e. dressing percentage, loin, ham, shoulder, belly, backfat, <b>leaf</b> <b>fat,</b> feet and head weights, two backfat thickness and one muscle depth measurements, ham + loin and back + <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> percentages and estimated carcass lean content were analysed. Animals were typed {{for a total of}} 137 markers covering the entire porcine genome. Analyses were performed using a line-cross (LC) regression method where founder lines were assumed to be fixed for different QTL alleles and a half/full sib (HFS) maximum likelihood method where allele substitution effects were estimated within each half-/full-sib family. Additional analyses were performed to search for multiple linked QTL and imprinting effects. Significant gene effects were evidenced for both leanness and fatness traits in the telomeric regions of SSC 1 q and SSC 2 p, on SSC 4, SSC 7 and SSC X. Additional significant QTL were identified for ham weight on SSC 5, for head weight on SSC 1 and SSC 7, for feet weight on SSC 7 and for dressing percentage on SSC X. LW alleles were associated with a higher lean content and a lower fat content of the carcass, except for the fatness trait on SSC 7. Suggestive evidence of linked QTL on SSC 7 and of imprinting effects on SSC 6, SSC 7, SSC 9 and SSC 17 were also obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the interactive effects of porcine somatotropin (pST) and the beta-agonist salbutamol on the growth and carcass characteristics of three genotypes of pigs differing in lean and fat deposition potential. Thirty-two pigs each of either 1 / 4 Duroc- 3 / 4 white composite (Duroc crossbred), purebred Meishan, or 1 / 4 Meishan- 3 / 4 white composite (Meishan crossbred) breeding were injected daily with 0 or 4 mg pST and fed a diet containing 0 or 2. 75 ppm salbutamol for approximately 34 d and subsequently slaughtered. As the percentage Meishan in the genotype increased, loin muscle area, semitendinosus weight, average daily gain (ADG), and carcass gain decreased. There was an interaction between salbutamol and genotype for ADG, daily protein gain, and total carcass gain, resulting in Meishan crossbred pigs having similar rates to non-treated Duroc crossbred pigs. When Duroc crossbred pigs were treated with salbutamol, both daily protein gain and total carcass gain were greatest, whereas ADG was nonsignificantly greater than that of untreated Duroc crossbred and salbutamol-treated Meishan crossbred pigs. Meishan pigs did not respond to salbutamol treatment for the criteria mentioned. Both pST and salbutamol increased loin muscle area and semitendinosus weight across genotypes. <b>Leaf</b> <b>fat</b> was reduced more by pST treatment in purebred Meishan pigs than in the other two genotypes, and salbutamol treatment resulted in small reductions in <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> across genotypes. Efficiency of feed utilization was similar among genotypes but increased with either pST or salbutamol treatment. The results of this research indicate that porcine somatotropin and the beta-agonist salbutamol have additive effects on the growth and carcass criteria of pigs. However, both growth modifiers appear to have differing degrees of response in different genotypes of swine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} the mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody against 40 kDa adipocyte-specific plasma membrane protein on porcine adipocytes and carcass composition were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results revealed that the in vitro complement-mediated cytotoxicity of this monoclonal antibody can lead to adipocyte lysis, remarkable reduction of adipocyte lipid accumulation (P< 0. 01), and significant decrease of well-differentiated fat cells (P< 0. 01). Treatment of adipocytes with this antibody alone in vitro did not induce cell lysis, but could lead to noticeable reduction of well-differentiated cells and lipid accumulation (P< 0. 05) at the pre-adipocyte stage. In vivo, pigs injected with 0. 5 mg/kg or 1. 0 mg/kg of antibody showed smaller adipocyte sizes (P< 0. 01) and reduced lipid accumulation of adipocytes (P< 0. 01). Our results also indicated that pigs intraperitoneally or subcutaneously immunized with 0. 5 mg/kg of monoclonal antibody at 15 kg or 1. 0 mg/kg antibody at 60 kg had a higher lean meat percentage (P< 0. 05), larger loin eye area (P< 0. 05), lower fat meat percentage (P< 0. 05), less backfat thickness (P< 0. 05) and smaller <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> weight (P< 0. 05) than the control pigs, but other carcass traits such as caul fat weight, heart weight, liver weight, spleen weight, kidney weight, lung weight, and dressing percentage were not significantly affected.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between CBG and pork quality in 5 European breeding lines, Pietrain, Large White (LW), and Landrace purebred lines, a Duroc synthetic line, and a Meishan (MS) x LW advanced intercross. Cortisol-binding globulin maximum binding capacity (CBG-Bmax) was twice as high (P or = 0. 364) association between CBG-Bmax and carcass quality traits in Pietrain gilts, but CBG-Bmax was associated with increased loin yields in LW (P = 0. 010) and Landrace (P = 0. 103) gilts, decreased ham yields (P = 0. 082) in Duroc gilts, and increased fat depth (P = 0. 064) and <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> (P = 0. 001) in MS x LW gilts. There was no association between CBG-Bmax and pork quality traits in Pietrain (P > or = 0. 269) and Duroc (P > or = 0. 114) gilts. Conversely, CBG-Bmax was associated with lighter (higher L* values; P < 0. 05) pork in Land-race gilts, as well as lower (P <or = 0. 055) ultimate pH in the LM and semimembranosus, and a tendency for lower (P = 0. 095) L* values of pork from LW gilts. Within MS x LW pigs, CBG-Bmax was associated with increased drip loss (P = 0. 001) and decreased i. m. fat in the semimembranosus (P = 0. 005).

40|$|Obesity is {{a rising}} {{worldwide}} public health problem. Difficulties to precisely measure various obesity traits and the genetic heterogeneity in human have been major impediments to completely disentangle genetic factors causing obesity. The pig is a relevant model for studying human obesity and obesity-related (OOR) traits. Using founder breeds divergent {{with respect to}} obesity traits we have created an F 2 pig resource population (454 pigs), which has been intensively phenotyped for 36 OOR traits. The main rationale for our study is to characterize the genetic architecture of OOR traits in the F 2 pig design, by estimating heritabilities, genetic and phenotypic correlations using mixed- and multi-trait BLUP animal models. Our analyses revealed high coefficients of variation (15 - 42 per cent) and moderate to high heritabilities (0. 22 - 0. 81) in fatness traits, showing large phenotypic and genetic variation in the F 2 population, respectively. This fulfills the purpose of creating a resource population divergent for OOR traits. Strong genetic correlations were found between weight and lean mass at dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning (0. 56 – 0. 97). Weight and conformation also showed strong genetic correlations with slaughter traits (e. g. rg between abdominal circumference and <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> at slaughtering: 0. 66). Genetic correlations between fat-related traits and the glucose level vary between 0. 35 and 0. 74 and show {{a strong correlation between}} adipose tissue and impaired glucose metabolism. Our power calculations showed a minimum of 80 % power for QTL detection for all phenotypes. We revealed genetic correlations at population level, for the first time, for several difficult to measure and novel OOR traits and diseases. The results underpin the potential of the established F 2 pig resource population for further genomic, systems genetics and functional investigations to unravel the genetic background of OOR traits...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{quality is}} of {{increasing}} economic {{importance to the}} pork industry today, which is {{in contrast with the}} more traditional focus of pig selection for lean growth. Meat quality is however determined by many factors with a complex mutual relationship. In this regard, PPARGC 1 A is a very interesting candidate gene because it not only plays a crucial role in energy and fat metabolism but also has an important influence on the muscle fibre type composition. However, only {{little is known about the}} regulation of expression of this gene in the pig and its usefulness in pig selection. In order to get a better understanding of the regulation of PPARGC 1 A expression, 1 898 base pairs (bp) from the promoter region and the complete 3 'UTR (3 826 bp) were sequenced and screened for mutations in 7 diverse pig breeds. Respectively 5 and 6 new mutations were discovered in these regions, of which several were in complete linkage disequilibrium with each other. None of the detected SNPs appeared to be located in any conserved part of the sequence when comparing different species. In an association analysis with intramuscular fat percentage, <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> weight or last rib backfat depth carried out in a Landrace-Duroc-Yorkshire commercial research population (n = 960), no associations were detected for the new SNPs from this study or for 2 previously described SNPs in exon 8 and 9.

Two groups of 12 pigs genetically selected for either high or low serum cholesterol were used to determine the differences in cholesterol metabolism produced by either high or low cholesterol levels in the neonatal diet. The pigs were fed either a high (. 5 %) or low (O%) cholesterol diet from birth until 4 weeks. They then were feed the low cholesterol diet until 8 weeks after which they were fed a high (. 5 %) cholesterol diet until 6 months. Brain (P. 05). Back fat at the first rib (P <. 01), at the last lumbar vertebrae (P <. 05), and at the 10 th rib (P <. 01), when adjusted for weight, were affected by diet. The four lean cuts, both rough and trimmed, were heavier due to diet, but not genetics. But when data were examined as a percentage of body weight, only the trimmed ham was affected by diet. Brain cholesterol concentration was higher in the high diet groups (P <. 03). This finding possibly indicates the ability of cholesterol to cross the blood-brain barrier, but more conclusive evidence is needed. Liver cholesterol was higher in the high diet group. Longissimus dorsi muscle, semitendinosus muscles, and subcutaneous fat cholesterol concentrations showed no relationship to any of the treatments. Mesenteric fat and <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> cholesterol levels were statistically higher due to diet. Throughout all variables, no diet x genetic interactions were seen.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} preservation methods of catfish by-products (CBP), and the effects of replacing marine fish meal (FM) with these processing byproducts on diet digestibility, performance, feed efficiency and carcass quality in growing-finishing pigs. Paper I presents data on catfish production, processing and the nutritive value of catfish by-product meals (CBM) in the Mekong Delta (MD) of Vietnam. In Paper II, CBP silage made with 20 - 40 % addition of sugar cane molasses (M) was of a better quality than when made with rice bran (RB) at the same levels. The optimum proportion for successful silages with M was 8 : 2, and with RB 7 : 3 (CBP and M or RB, fresh weight basis). The total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of CP in CBP ensiled with RB or M was comparable to that of FM, but ether extract (EE) digestibility in ensiled CBP was higher. However, N utilization was not significantly different among FM and silage diets. In Paper III, the coefficient of ileal apparent digestibility (CIAD) of CP in CBP ensiled with M (ECM) tended to be higher than that in CBM, processing waste water (WWB) and FM. However, the CIAD and CTTAD of EE in FM were lower than in CBP. Amino acid digestibility and nitrogen retention were not affected by replacement of FM. Results from Paper IV showed that, the higher the inclusion level of WWB as replacement for FM in the diet, the lower the average daily feed intake (ADFI), amino acid intake and average daily gain (ADG). However, feed conversion ratio (FCR) was improved, and the feed cost was reduced to 68 % of that of the FM diet. In Paper V, a higher inclusion level of ECM as replacement for FM in the diet resulted in slightly lower ADFI, but increased ADG. As a result, FCR was improved and feed cost of the diet with 100 % CP coming from ECM reduced to 72 % of the cost of the diet with 100 % of the CP from FM. Carcass yield and dressing percentage were not affected by ECM replacement, but <b>leaf</b> <b>fat</b> and back fat thickness were higher with higher ECM replacement of FM.
