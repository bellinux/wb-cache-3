In 2012, the combined population of the downtown neighbourhoods (including the Downtown Commercial Core, the Downtown East Village, the Downtown West End, Eau Claire, Chinatown, and the Beltline) was 36,228.

Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property.

The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E

25|$|While {{long after}} {{designing}} the Long Island parkway system, Robert Moses constructed three stations along the Northern State Parkway. One was located {{east of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway interchange (exit31A) in Carle Place, which was closed in 1986. The second was located in Commack, located west of CR4, opened in the early 1950s and abandoned in 1985. The Commack station, which still stands, was proposed in 1989 by the Huntington town historian Rufus Langhans the save the station, which {{was in danger of}} being demolished, suggesting the station be declared a town landmark and possibly be a welcome center for the Northern State. However, at the time, the New York State Department of Transportation, was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> angles to {{what to do with the}} former gas stations.|$|E
25|$|Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation, {{a company}} known {{at that time}} for the {{production}} of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study {{on the second floor of}} his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin.|$|E

Johnson also used his line-item-veto power thousands of times. He credits his heavy veto pen for eliminating New Mexico's budget deficit and cutting the growth rate of New Mexico's government in half." [...] According to the Myrtle Beach Sun News, Johnson [...] "said his numerous vetoes, only two of which were overridden, stemmed from his philosophy of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> things for their cost–benefit ratio and his axe fell on Republicans as well as Democrats." ...|$|E

People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E

In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it seems to me like he is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E

500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I remember <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before stepping foot on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E
