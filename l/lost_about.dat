The series was cancelled after 13 weeks, last airing on July 15, 1977.

5|$|Before the battle, both armies {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by smaller units; {{by the time}} of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 15,000 men (approx. 5,000 killed), although some sources suggest a slightly higher number, perhaps 15,600 or 15,700, about 26 percent. Christopher Duffy places Russian losses at 13,477; in addition, the Russians had <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 4,000 at the Battle of Kay a week earlier. Sources differ on Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, a casualty rate of more than 37 percent. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 39 percent, and that two thirds (12,000) of the 19,000 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.|$|E

An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 {{on the slopes of}} Hill 123.

5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> half the forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E
5|$|Despite some protests, on 18 September 1773, the Committee {{formally}} {{signed the}} treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories. The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty. By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting {{at that time to}} about 733,000km²), with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were <b>lost.</b> <b>About</b> 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, the North Koreans {{resumed their}} attack. A {{battalion}} of North Korean troops drove the ROK police out of T'ongyong {{but did not}} hold it long. UN naval forces heavily shelled T'ongyong as three companies of ROK Marines from Koje Island made an amphibious landing near the town. The ROK force then attacked the North Koreans and, supported by naval gun fire, drove them out. The North Koreans at T'ongyong <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 350 men, the survivors withdrew to Chinju.|$|E
5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E

Offshore, waves reached 40feet (12m) in height. The Lithuanian freighter Linkuva, en route to Long Beach, California, encountered the waves and strong winds as the hurricane was undergoing its period of rapid intensification. After an engine failure, the freighter was <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 220miles (355km) southwest of Acapulco. A naval vessel from both the United States Navy and the Mexican Navy searched for the freighter for three days, though the crew was lost and presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|The Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men {{during the}} conflict, 80 {{percent of them}} to disease. It was {{estimated}} that the Italians <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> {{three times as many}} men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules. With Gazzera's surrender, Gondar became the only area in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control. The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final season of The O.C., an American teen drama {{television}} series, aired in the United States from November 2, 2006 to February 22, 2007 and consisted of sixteen episodes. The O.Cs final season aired Thursdays at 9:00p.m. ET in the United States on Fox, a terrestrial television network. Fox tested a new timeslot by airing the second episode on Wednesday at 9:00p.m. ET against ABC's Lost and CBS's Criminal Minds. With <b>Lost</b> <b>about</b> to enter a three-month hiatus, Fox hoped that changing the timeslot for The O.C. would attract back viewers it had lost {{since the end of}} the previous season; however, the move was unsuccessful and the show returned to its Thursday timeslot.|$|E

5|$|Wealth, like {{income and}} taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% {{of the adult}} {{population}} possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> a quarter of their value. Since peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2007, household wealth was down $14trillion, but has since increased $14trillion over 2006 levels.

5|$|While the Union <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 1,500 {{killed and}} wounded, the Confederate {{casualty}} rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses {{are estimated to}} be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox's brigade reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.|$|E

The Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with −6.9%, a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28.4% lower than in 2005, and with 111,000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). As a result, Greeks have <b>lost</b> <b>about</b> 40% of their purchasing power {{since the start of}} the crisis, they spend 40% less on goods and services, and the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate grew from 7.5% in September 2008 to a record high of 27.9% in June 2013, while the youth unemployment rate rose from 22.0% to as high as 62%.
