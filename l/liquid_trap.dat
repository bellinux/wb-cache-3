5000|$|A <b>Liquid</b> <b>Trap</b> Diode has {{a wicked}} {{reservoir}} at the evaporator {{end of the}} heat pipe, with a separate wick {{that is not in}} communication with the wick in the remainder of the heat pipe. [...] During normal operation, the evaporator and reservoir are heated. The vapor flows to the condenser, and liquid returns to the evaporator by capillary forces in the wick. The reservoir eventually dries out, since there is no method for returning liquid. When the nominal condenser is heated, liquid condenses in the evaporator and the reservoir. While the liquid can return to the nominal condenser from the nominal evaporator, the liquid in the reservoir is trapped, since the reservoir wick is not connected. Eventually, all of the liquid is trapped in the reservoir, and the heat pipe ceases operation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to study two {{important}} features of the Mechanically Fluidized Reactor (MFR) : the good distribution of injected liquid on fluidized particles and the high heat transfer rate from the heated wall to the bed. Multiple industrial processes use liquid injection in fluidized bed reactors. The liquid distribution in the reactor should be efficient to minimize bed defluidization and to maximize the yield {{and quality of the}} products. The study used two MFR units, with internal volumes of 1. 0 and 4. 42 litre, respectively. Induction heating was used to rapidly heat the bed, which is a unique feature of the system. To characterize the distribution of injected liquid, an experimental method measured the amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>trapped</b> in agglomerates and the mass of agglomerates. The amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>trapped</b> in agglomerates decreased with increasing impeller rotation speed. The best impeller speed to achieve nearly perfect liquid distribution, with only 1 wt. % of the injected <b>liquid</b> <b>trapped</b> in agglomerates, was 130 rpm. To study wall to bed heat transfer, temperature measurements for the small MFR were used to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficients. It was observed that the overall heat transfer coefficient increased significantly with increasing particle size and a strong influence of the superficial velocity of the vaporized liquid on the heat transfer coefficients was noted. The wall to bed heat transfer coefficient was typical of the values that can be achieved with traditional bubbling fluidized beds, even at vapour velocities below the minimum fluidization velocity.

40|$|Host-seeking female tabanid flies, {{that need}} {{mammalian}} blood {{for the development}} of their eggs, can be captured by the classic canopy trap with an elevated shiny black sphere as a luring visual target. The design of more efficient tabanid traps is important for stock-breeders to control tabanids, since these blood-sucking insects can cause severe problems for livestock, especially for horse- and cattle-keepers: reduced meat/milk production in cattle farms, horses cannot be ridden, decreased quality of hides due to biting scars. We show here that male and female tabanids can be caught by a novel, weather-proof liquid-filled black tray laid on the ground, because the strongly and horizontally polarized light reflected from the black liquid surface attracts water-seeking polarotactic tabanids. We performed field experiments to reveal the ideal elevation of the <b>liquid</b> <b>trap</b> and to compare the tabanid-capturing efficiency of three different traps: (1) the classic canopy trap, (2) the new polarization <b>liquid</b> <b>trap,</b> and (3) the combination of the two traps. In field tests, we showed that the combined trap captures 2. 4 - 8. 2 times more tabanids than the canopy trap alone.

Laboratory scale solid phase digesters were operated with intact, untreated leaf biomass feedstock in a weekly-fed, batch mode without spent material removal for a period of 300 days. High biogas production rates were achieved by a twice daily sprinkling of the biomass bed with recycled liquid phase containing biodegradative bacteria.

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. This paper {{describes}} a thermal switching cryogenic heat pipe, which {{is needed to}} thermally manage two CCD cameras within the ABC instrument on the NASA/JPL SIM Lite telescope. The primary requirement is to transport 12 W from the 150 K CCD cameras to a 140 K primary radiator 1. 4 m away. The heat pipe is a 1. 5 cm OD Al axial groove design with methane as the working fluid, which provides 75 W-m of transport capacity at 140 K. A secondary requirement is to periodically heat (decontaminate) the CCD cameras to 293 K with minimal heater power. To meet the decontamination requirement, the heat pipe was modified to provide thermal switching by using small diameter SS tubing to connect it to a <b>liquid</b> <b>trap</b> (LT) cooled by a small secondary radiator (SR) which is thermally isolated from the primary radiator (PR). The LT is a scaled-up version of the LTs used on the CRISM flight system. During normal operation, a small heater keeps the LT filled only with vapor. During decontamination, the LT heater is turned OFF, the PR is heated by midsized heaters and/or heat pipe conduction, the SR-cooled LT captures the working fluid effectively turning the heat pipe OFF, and a small evaporator heater raises the instrument temperature to 293 K. When the LT heater is re-enabled, the system returns to normal operation. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and testing of this demonstration system...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recently in our {{laboratory}} {{we needed}} a reliable and relatively simple source of aqueous solutions of [11 C]CO 2. We examined various methods of trapping [11 C]CO 2 gas both in solution and on ion exchange resins, followed by elution into aqueous phase. We favor simple methods that have high trapping and elution efficiencies and produce a highly concentrated solution. Furthermore, we desired methods that would minimize the use of hazardous reagents and materials with respect to both handling and disposal. We also considered the formulation of the final solution in terms of chemical compatibility with contacted materials, working {{with the assumption that}} dilute bicarbonate or carbonate solutions will have little reactivity with many materials. In a phantom, compatibility with materials (i. e. plastics, glues, metals, etc.) is important (1 - 4), while in (bio) geochemical studies – where transport of carbon is important – the chemical form of the radiolabelled molecule is important, but compatibility must be determined on a case-by-case basis (5 - 7). Small medical cyclotrons can easily produce carbon- 11 as gaseous [11 C]CO 2, and various methods are utilized to incorporate carbon- 11 into solution, often with unfavorable resource requirements, costs, or chemical properties. Commonly [11 C]CO 2 gas is bubbled through a strong base, forming the carbonate anion; but neutralizing a strong base (as to avoid special handling or disposal requirements) requires a large volume of diluent or buffer; or a very precise addition of acid – which if done improperly – may lead to an acidic pH and subsequent loss of [11 C]CO 2 from solution (8, 9). Alternatively, [11 C]CO 2 (or [11 C]CH 4) can be converted to [11 C]CH 3 I at high-yield, but requires specialized, expensive radio-synthesis equipment (10 - 12). [11 C]CH 3 I can then be trapped in DMSO (albeit providing a volatile and hazardous solution) or used as a synthon en route to water soluble compounds such as [11 C]choline (13). Finally, leftover radiolabelled radiopharmaceuticals from a carbon- 11 imaging experiment could be used, but chemical compatibility (i. e. lipophilicity) of the radiolabelled compound may be of concern. Carbon dioxide gas will dissolve with a solubility of 1. 5 g/L at STP (9) and slowly react with water to generate carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3), a weak acid. Passing [11 C]CO 2 through a base-activated ion exchange cartridge, the [11 C]CO 2 reacts with hydroxide ions to form [11 C]carbonate which is bound to the resin due to its higher selectivity for carbonate than hydroxide (14). Elution with excess bicarbonate displaces [11 C]carbonate and neutralizes any remaining hydroxide, providing a 11 C aqueous solution that is mildly basic, chemically non-hazardous, and very concentrated. Material and Methods [11 C]CO 2 gas trapping efficiency was evaluated for solutions and base-activated ion exchange resins. The gas was delivered either rapidly in a high-flow bolus directly from the cyclotron target or slowly in a low-flow helium stream during heating of a carbosieves column. Elution efficiency of ion exchange cartridges were evaluated for both fraction of trapped activity eluted and volume of solution needed for elution. [11 C]CO 2 was produced via the 14 N(p,α) 11 C reaction on a CTI RDS 111 – 11 MeV cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Bio-medical Isotope Facility. The 7 mL target is pressurized to 315 psi with 1 % O 2 /N 2 gas, equating to 150 mL gas at STP. For direct-from-target trapping experiments, the target was decompressed and routed to the cartridge via 50 feet of 0. 020 ” I. D. tubing until the target falls to atmospheric pressure (~ 55 seconds) providing an inhomogeneous flow – a short rapid burst of flow followed by a longer low-flow bleed. For helium-eluted experiments, the [11 C]CO 2 was unloaded from the cyclotron target and trapped on a room-temperature carbosieves column (15). Target gases were subsequently flushed from the column for 30 seconds with helium at 50 mL/min. After heating the column to 125 °C without gas flow, [11 C]CO 2 was eluted off the column in helium at 15 mL/min. [11 C]CO 2 /He was bubbled through 9 aqueous and 2 organic solutions to test for trapping efficiency in a slow, steady helium stream at 15 mL/min (sodium hydroxide (0. 96 M, 0. 096 M, 0. 0096 M), sodium bicarbonate (1. 14 M, 0. 57 M, 0. 057 M), sodium carbonate (2. 0 M, 1. 0 M, 0. 10 M), ethanol, and DMSO (2 mL ea.). An Ascarite-filled cartridge was attached to trap any untrapped [11 C]CO 2. Measures of radioactivity were made using a Capintec CRC- 15 R dose calibrator. Trapping efficiency for solutions is calculated as the fraction of radioactivity captured in solution relative to the sum of the solution and the Ascarite trap. Three different commercially available, ion ex-change cartridges were evaluated for trapping and elution efficiencies. FIGURE 1 shows a photo-graphic comparison of the physical size and shapes of the cartridges as well as a X-ray computed tomography (CT) cross sectional view of the internal ion exchange resin volume and dead volume of the cartridges. All cartridges were activated with 1 mL of 1 N aqueous NaOH followed by passing 10 mL deionized water then 10 mL of air through the cartridge. In both direct-from-target (n = 4) and helium-stream experiments (n = 3 or 4), cartridges were connected to [11 C]CO 2 delivery lines via Luer connections. The gas exiting the cartridge passed through an empty 3 mL crimp-top vial as a <b>liquid</b> <b>trap</b> en route to an Ascarite trap on the vent needle as described above. Trapping efficiency for cartridges is calculated as the fraction of radioactivity captured on the cartridge relative to the sum of the cartridge, the empty vial, and the Ascarite trap. Cartridges were eluted with 0. 5 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (1. 14 M @ 20 °C) followed by 9. 5 mL water and 10 mL air. Elution efficiency is calculated as the fraction of radioactivity eluted in 10 mL relative to the sum of the spent cartridge following elution and the 10 mL eluate (Equation 5). The pH of the eluate was measured using 0 - 14 pH test strips. Results and Conclusion The trapping of [11 C]CO 2 in all solutions was less than 70 % of the total radioactivity {{with the exception of the}} 0. 96 M and 0. 096 M NaOH. With a higher concentration of base driving equilibrium towards carbonate stability, it could be expected that the most basic solution had the best trapping efficiency, but this attribute also means it is least desirable solution to work with from a hazardous material or chemical compatibility perspective. When [11 C]CO 2 was delivered in a helium stream, all three cartridges performed at near 100 % efficiency, as shown in FIGURE 4. With higher flow, direct-from-target delivery, the cartridges trapped [11 C]CO 2 with a wider range of efficiencies: ICOH (99 ± 1 %), ORTG (90 ± 2 %), and QMA (79 ± 4 %). Elution resulted in > 99 % release of carbon- 11 activity for both QMA and ORTG cartridges, but only 39 ± 3 % release from the ICOH cartridge. Elution efficiency of the trapped radioactivity (Equation 5) was independent of the method of [11 C]CO 2 delivery. Across all cartridges and delivery methods, the eluate was at about pH = 10. We recommend that the ORTG cartridge be used for trapping of [11 C]CO 2 gas with elution by > 300 µL of saturated bicarbonate solution. This recommendation is based on the better trapping for ORTG cartridges compared to the QMA cartridges in the direct-from-target [11 C]CO 2 delivery method and the smaller volume needed for elution of all trapped carbon. This method excels based on its simplicity, adaptability to automation, low-cost ($ 5 /cartridge), and observations that a single ORTG cartridge suffers no loss of performance after multiple uses. A potential disadvantage to this method is that it involves using a carbon-containing eluent, which means that this method cannot be used for imaging experiments that require high specific activity. However, considering the eluate is a mildly basic aqueous solution, we expect that it will be compatible with a wide variety of materials and experimental applications...|$|E

At low withdrawal velocity V, it is shown experimentally that the film exactly fills {{the gap between the}} pillars; its thickness hd is independent of V and corresponds to the pillar height hp. At larger velocity, hd slowly increases with V and tends towards the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin (LLD) thickness h LLD observed on a flat solid. We model the entrainment by adapting the LLD theory to a double layer consisting of <b>liquid</b> <b>trapped</b> inside the texture and covered by a free film. This model allows us to understand quantitatively our different observations and to predict the transition between hp and hLLD. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|In an {{experiment}} in space {{it was found that}} when a cubical frame was slowly withdrawn from a soap solution, the wire frame retained practically a full cube of liquid. Removed from the frame (by shaking), the faces of the cube became progressively more concave, until adjacent faces became tangential. In the present paper a mathematical model describing the shape a liquid takes due to its surface tension while suspended on a wire frame in zero-g is solved by use of Lagrange multipliers. It is shown how the configuration of soap films so bounded is dependent upon the volume of <b>liquid</b> <b>trapped</b> in the films. A special case of the solution is a soap film naturally formed on a cubical wire frame...|$|R
