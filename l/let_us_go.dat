500|$|This policy became {{immediately}} {{evident in}} the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal, the Tulunids: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and a further 200,000 dinars in arrears, {{as well as the}} return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar. To seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada ("Dew Drop") as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a [...] "wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history" [...] (Thierry Bianquis). Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. According to a story, after a thorough search, al-Mu'tadid's chief eunuch could only find five ornate silver-and-gold candlesticks to decorate the palace, while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick. Thereupon al-Mu'tadid is said to have remarked [...] "come <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> and hide ourselves, lest we be seen in our poverty".|$|E

2500|$|When Gladstone first joined Palmerston's {{government}} in 1859, he had opposed further electoral reform, but {{he changed his}} position during Palmerston's last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns; the policy caused friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement. [...] At {{the beginning of each}} session, Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him.

2500|$|The Dutch {{now made}} a second attempt on Fontenoy, {{reinforced}} with Austrian cavalry and two battalions of British infantry, including the Highland Regiment.

[...] However, concerted French fire drove the allied forces off again. This dispirited the Dutch who retired out of range and {{did not participate in}} the main attack. Along the French right flank the allies had been routed; but the battle was not yet over. On being congratulated by Monsieur de Bauffremont, Saxe simply replied, [...] "all is not said; <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> to the English, they will be harder to digest", and, at about 10:15, he abandoned his wicker carriage and mounted his famous white palfrey.|$|E
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E
