40|$|A lifting fixture {{has been}} {{designed}} to handle the Samus counters. These counters are being removed from the D-zero area and will be transported off site for further use at another facility. This fixture is designed specifically for this particular application and will be transferred along with the counters. The future use of these counters may entail installation at a facility without access to a crane and therefore a lift fixture suitable for both crane and/or fork lift usage has been created The counters weigh approximately 3000 lbs. and have threaded rods extended through the counter at the top comers for lifting. When these counters were first handled/installed these rods were used in conjunction with appropriate slings and handled by crane. The rods are secured with nuts tightened against the face of the counter. The rod thread is M 16 x 2 ({approx}. 625 -inch dia.) and extends 2 -inch (on average) {{from the face of the}} counter. It is this cantilevered rod that the lift fixture engages with 'C' style plates at the four top comers. The strongback portion of the lift fixture is a steel rectangular tube 8 -inch (vertical) x 4 -inch x. 25 -inch wall, 130 -inch long. 1. 5 -inch square bars are welded perpendicular to the long axis of the rectangular tube at the appropriate lift points and the 'C' plates are fastened to these bars with 3 / 4 - 10 high strength bolts -grade 8. Two short channel sections are positioned-welded-to the bottom of the rectangular tube on 40 feet centers, which are used as locators for fork lift tines. On the top are <b>lifting</b> <b>eyes</b> for sling/crane usage and are rated at 3500 lbs. safe working load each - vertical lift only...|$|E
