500|$|The global {{recession}} grew steadily worse throughout 2008, and saw large {{falls in}} the stock market at the beginning of October when Britain's <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> index, the FTSE100, recorded its largest single-day points fall since 1987. On 8 October, in response to the crisis, the government announced a bank rescue package of £500billion; approximately [...] The plan aimed to restore market confidence, help stabilise the British banking system and provide for a range of short-term loans and guarantees of interbank lending, and up to £50billion of state investment in the banks themselves. Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, said that Brown [...] "defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort".|$|E

He remained at Brussels until August 1782, when he was despatched to Paris by Lord Shelburne as plenipotentiary to negotiate a peace with the crowns of France and Spain, and with the States General of the United Provinces and on 20 January 1783 the preliminaries of peace with the first two powers were duly signed. The peace with the American colonies, which was agreed to {{at about the same}} date, was not brought to a conclusion under Fitzherbert's charge, but he claimed to have taken a <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> in the previous negotiations which rendered it possible. This successful diplomacy led to his promotion in the summer of 1783 to the post of envoy extraordinary to the Empress Catherine of Russia, and he accompanied her in her tour round the Crimea in 1787.|$|E

60|$|The puppet monarch, terrified at the {{disorder}} that prevailed, and finding his authority was purely nominal--the real power {{resting in the}} hands of his own sons, who had taken a <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> in getting up the revolt, and in those of the Sepoy generals--began to long for rest and quiet. The heavy shell which from time to time crashed into his palace disturbed his peace, and, through his wives, he secretly endeavored to open negotiations with the British. These overtures were, however, rejected. The king had no power whatever, and he and his household were all concerned in the massacres which had taken place in the palace itself.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps, however, {{it may be}} {{well for}} me to observe that {{approbation}} of {{the manner in which}} a great biblical scholar, for instance, Reuss, does his work does not commit me to the adoption of all, or indeed any of his views; and, further, that the disagreements of a series of investigators do not in any way interfere with the fact that each of them has made important contributions to the body of truth ultimately established. If I cite Buffon, Linnæus, Lamarck, and Cuvier, as having each and all taken a <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> in building up modern biology, the statement that every one of these great naturalists disagreed with, and even more or less contradicted, all the rest is quite true; but the supposition that the latter assertion is in any way inconsistent with the former, would betray a strange ignorance of the manner in which all true science advances.|$|E

Every man saw that the struggle with Rome must ere long take place, and was eager to take a <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> in the conflict. It was upon them that the blow had fallen most heavily in the former partial rising, and they knew that the other tribes of the Iceni held that their defence of their camp should not have been overborne by the Romans as it was; hence they had something of a private wrong as well as a national one to avenge. Another fortnight was spent in constant work, until one day the news came that Boadicea's daughters had been most grossly insulted by the Roman officers, and that the queen herself had started for Camalodunum to demand from Decianus a redress of their wrongs and the punishment of the offenders. The excitement was intense. Every man felt the outrage upon the daughters of their queen as a personal injury, and when Beric took his place before the men of the tribe, who were drawn up in military order, a shout arose: [...] "Lead us to Camalodunum! Let us take vengeance!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{order of}} the Knights of St. John, which for some centuries played a very {{important}} part in the great struggle between Christianity and Mahomedanism, was, at its origin, a semi-religious body, its members being, like other monks, bound by vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty, and pledged to minister to the wants of the pilgrims who flocked to the Holy Places, to receive them at their great Hospital--or guest house--at Jerusalem, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and to defend them on their passage to and from the sea, against attack by Moslems. In a comparatively short time the constitution of the order was changed, and the Knights Hospitallers became, like the Templars, a great military Order pledged to defend the Holy Sepulchre, and to war everywhere against the Moslems. The Hospitallers bore a <b>leading</b> <b>share</b> in the struggle which terminated in the triumph of the Moslems, and the capture by them of Jerusalem. The Knights of St. John then established themselves at Acre, but after a valiant defence of that fortress, removed to Crete, and shortly afterwards to Rhodes. There they fortified the town, and withstood two terrible sieges by the Turks. At {{the end of the second}} they obtained honourable terms from Sultan Solyman, and retiring to Malta established themselves there in an even stronger fortress than that of Rhodes, and repulsed all the efforts of the Turks to dispossess them. The Order was the great bulwark of Christendom against the invasion of the Turks, and the tale of their long struggle is one of absorbing interest, and of the many eventful episodes none is more full of incident and excitement than the first siege of Rhodes, which I have chosen for the subject of my story.|$|E

The bottom-up algorithm can dramatically {{reduce the number of}} edges examined, which in turn accelerates the search as a whole.
