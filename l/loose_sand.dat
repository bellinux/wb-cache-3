5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} part of US-89, running northerly from Kanab, mostly follows a succession of linear valleys. The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad opened a branch (later the Marysvale Branch) from its main line at Thistle to Manti in 1890, and extended it (through a subsidiary, the Sevier Railway), to Salina in 1891, Belknap in 1896, and Marysvale in 1900. No rail line ever reached farther south, and so residents of towns such as Junction, Panguitch, Alton, Glendale, and Kanab had to travel north to the railhead at Marysvale. The old county road through Circleville Canyon was poorly constructed, with steep grades and a rough surface. The State Road Commission designated the highway from Nephi east through Salt Creek Canyon and then south through these valleys to Kanab as a state road in or soon after 1910. Initially the route from the summit at Long Valley Junction to Kanab went through Alton and Johnson Canyon, entering Kanab from the east. A more direct route via Long Valley was considered, serving the communities of Glendale, Orderville, and Mt. Carmel, but this would have required difficult construction over a mesa covered in <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> to reach Kanab. In summer 1912, the commission added a branch from Long Valley Junction to Mt. Carmel, allowing these communities access to the state road system, along with a connection west from the junction to Cedar City. Several years later, in December 1915, the commission added the Mt. Carmel-Kanab road over the sand hills to the system, and began construction of a sand-clay road in 1916. A connection from Pigeon Hollow Junction north to Thistle was also added in 1912, following the rail line through a canyon and providing another route to Salt Lake City.|$|E

25|$|A {{dust storm}} or sandstorm, a {{meteorological}} phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions, arises when a gust front passes {{or when the}} wind force exceeds the threshold value where <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> and dust are removed from the dry surface.

25|$|Shimōsa Plateau sits {{above the}} , a {{geological}} group under the Bōsō Peninsula. The Shimōsa Group {{dates from the}} Tertiary and Pleistocene periods, and is roughly divided into the Jizodo, Yabu, and Narita formations. The geological group consists primarily of sedimentary layers of <b>loose</b> <b>sand,</b> and secondarily of clay silt and pebbly-sand layers. Above the Shimōsa Group are more recent rich, fertile layers of volcanic ash. The Shimōsa Plateau yields great deposits of fossils, notably molluscan fossils, as the plateau was originally submerged under water.|$|E
25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the column}} of General Abercromby made very slow {{progress}} along the beach, mostly because {{the tide was}} coming in again, which narrowed the beach to a very small band, consisting of <b>loose</b> <b>sand.</b> The troops and horses were suffering severely from fatigue and thirst. In {{the course of the}} afternoon they were observed by the French who brought up sharpshooters at first, who caused a number of casualties, especially of the officers. The French sent more and more substantial reinforcements through the dunes and eventually General Vandamme brought up a substantial cavalry force which he led personally in a charge against the British horse-artillery batteries that temporarily fell into French hands. This cavalry attack was eventually repulsed by a counter-attack led by Lord Paget, who drove the French {{all the way back to}} Egmond aan Zee.|$|E
40|$|Granular piles/stone columns {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} preferred ground engineering systems for improving a variety of weak soils, such as soft clays, <b>loose</b> <b>sands,</b> waste fills, and ash ponds. They are installed using a range of techniques, namely vibro compaction, vibro replacement, composer method, rammed stone columns, and geopiers, based on on-site conditions and availability of machinery. Granular piles improve the ground by densification especially in <b>loose</b> <b>sands,</b> by reinforcement in case of waste fills and ash ponds, by reinforcement and consolidation in case of soft clays, and mitigate damages from liquefaction by functioning as drains. The paper presents a critical review of developments related to granular piles encompassing recent analytical, experimental, numerical studies, and field investigations of their compressive, uplift, and seismic responses. Three well-documented case histories of an embankment, a mechanically stabilized earth wall, and a liquid storage tank on granular pile-engineered ground are presented to illustrate their versatility...|$|R

25|$|All Batavian {{activity}} during the main {{phase of the}} battle was therefore on the British right flank, by the Batavian left wing. Here Daendels deployed his forces in three lines, as the front was too narrow to deploy more than two battalions in line at a time. He first had Col. Crass attack with the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 5th Demi-brigade, supported by cavalry and two pieces of horse artillery under Capt. d'Anguerand. He was opposed by the British 3rd Brigade (now under command of Gen. Coote, as Gen. Pulteney had received a wound in the arm and been forced to leave the field). The British had only enough room to deploy one battalion in line {{and there was a}} threat that they would be outflanked near Groote Keeten, where the main action was fought. However, the Batavians were severely hampered by the terrain. The horses sometimes sank to their bellies into the dune sand and the artillery was constantly immobilized by the <b>loose</b> <b>sand.</b> Besides, the British gunboats were able to get very close to the beach and supported the British infantry vigorously, whenever they got sight of the enemy though gaps in the dunes. This British naval gunfire wrought havoc on the Batavian troops.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is most often}} observed in saturated, loose (low density or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> {{has a tendency to}} compress when a load is applied; dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or 'dilate'. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the ground water table or sea level, then water fills the gaps between soil grains ('pore spaces'). In response to the soil compressing, this water increases in pressure and attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g. earthquake shaking, storm wave loading) such that it does not flow out in time before the next cycle of load is applied, the water pressures may build to an extent where they exceed the contact stresses between the grains of soil that keep them in contact with each other. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers are transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of soil structure causes it to lose all of its strength (the ability to transfer shear stress) and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence 'liquefaction').|$|E
500|$|Since {{the sides}} of the pit consist of <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> at its angle of repose, they afford an {{insecure}} foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as ants. Slipping to the bottom, the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit, it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> which are thrown at it from below by the larva. By throwing up <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> {{from the bottom of the}} pit, the larva also undermines {{the sides of}} the pit, causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them. Thus, it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers.|$|E

He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface.

"Man, however, had {{in former}} days {{considered}} {{this as a}} remote or unlikely event; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or, as other accounts said, and as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply an ancient Earl of the Orkneys had elected this neck of land as the place for establishing a mansion-house.

The windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure had rested, in former times, certain smaller compartments of the mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary for the Earl's retainers and menials. But these had become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood, or for other purposes; the walls had given way in many places; and, to complete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the ruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers the contained, to the depth of two or three feet.|$|E
500|$|Excavation of the 3rd Avenue tunnel segment {{began with}} the {{ceremonial}} launch of the [...] "Mighty Mole", a , [...] tunnel boring machine (TBM), on March 6, 1987. The TBM, designed by Robbins Company of Kent, Washington, and built by Nicholson Manufacturing in Seattle, began digging the western tunnel from Union Station the following May. A second, identical [...] "Mighty Mole" [...] TBM began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on June 29. During tunnel boring under 3rd Avenue between Spring Street and Madison Street on October 21, a small earthflow damaged a water main and caused pavement on 3rd Avenue to drop , shutting down water in the nearby Seattle City Light and 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza buildings. While repairing the broken water main, electricians working on damaged high-voltage cables caused a small power outage that affected eight downtown buildings {{on the night of}} October 28, but were able to restore power by the following morning. Work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in November, when the TBM hit an unexpectedly large pocket of <b>loose</b> <b>sand</b> under Madison Street that had to be stabilized with grout to prevent damage to the adjacent Seattle City Light building. Boring on both tunnels was stopped in early January 1988, when a pocket of wet sand was encountered [...] before the planned 90-degree turn onto Pine Street. Metro and tunnel contractors Atkinson/Dillingham, who had scheduled tunnel excavation for completion in mid-January, closed 3rd Avenue between Pike and Pine streets and installed 40 drilled wells to remove water from the sand pocket in February. Digging resumed on the western tunnel on March 14, and the TBM reached Westlake station on April 9, completing the first of the two tunnels.
