If the axial surface is a planar surface then it is called the axial plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane.

40|$|Abstract. We {{disprove}} Holtz and Ron’s conjecture {{that the}} power ideal CA,− 2 of a hyperplane arrangement A (also called the internal zonotopal space) is generated by A-monomials. We also show that, {{in contrast with the}} case k ≥ − 2, the Hilbert series of CA,k is not determined by the matroid of A for k ≤ − 6. Remark. This note is a corrigendum to our article [1], and we follow the notation of that paper. 1. Introduction. Let A = {H 1, [...] ., Hn} be a hyperplane arrangement in a vector space V; say Hi = {x | li(x) = 0 } for some linear functions li ∈ V ∗.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} a new {{approach}} to the numerical modelling of groundwater flow in compact rock massifs. Empirical knowledge of hydrogeologists is summarized first. There are three types of objects important for the groundwater flow in such massifs—small fractures, which can be replaced by blocks of porous media, large deterministic fractures and <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> the large fractures. We solve problem of the linear Darcy's flow on each of these three separated domains and then we join them by coupling the equations. We do not require geometrical correspondence between 1 D, 2 D and 3 D meshes, which simplifies the process of the spatial dicretization. The mixed-hybrid FEM with the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas elements is used for approximation of the solution. The advective mass transfer is solved by the FVM on the same discretization as the flow problem. Results of numerical experiments with the model are shown in the end of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{assessment}} of the potential sliding of wedge blocks involves identification <b>of</b> the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> the two planes on a stereograph. The stereographic envelope for kinematically feasible wedge intersections exists between {{the plane of the}} slope face and a friction circle. An alternative method of stereographic analysis is presented involving fitting great circles to a pair of poles representing the planes of the wedge. If the great circle passes through the polar daylight envelope for the slope face,without passing through the friction circle,wedge sliding on the pair of discontinuities is kinematically feasible. Thismethod is advantageous as 1) the distribution of discontinuity poles on a stereograph can be interpreted directly without showing the individual planes as great circles, 2) only pairs of discontinuities from opposing orientations are included, 3) geometric attributes of the potential wedges, such as symmetry and shape, can be assessed directly on the stereograph and 4) reduction of data to sets is not required prior to kinematic assessment...|$|R

40|$|Fifty seven short fatigue {{cracks in}} the Ni-base {{superalloy}} AP 1 have been examined, to ascertain how the paths taken by growing fatigue cracks are determined.

Initiation occurred in mode II, with the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> the initiation sites with the specimen top surface orientated at approximately 45 ° to the tensile axis.
