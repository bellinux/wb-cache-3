40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in the Department of Horticulture of Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute and 14 nurseries of prefectures of Taipei, Tainan, Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Miaoli and Changhwa. The purpose was to look for the proper ligatures to increase the percentage of take after grafting. The combirattions of the treatments were: (1) jute string for ligature and piling with earth, (2) jute string and enveloping with bamboo <b>leaf,</b> (3) jute <b>string,</b> enveloping with polystyene bag and piling with earth, (4) jute string, enveloping with polystyrene bag and bamboo <b>leaf,</b> (5) polystyrene <b>string,</b> enveloping with polystyrene bag and bamoo <b>leaf,</b> (6) polystyrene <b>string</b> and enveloping with polysyrene bag. 1. Jute ligature, piling with earth: It was commonly used in Hsinchu and Miaoli prefectures in Taiwan. The percentage of take averaged 86. 86 % under con-tinuously fine days, under rainy days there was only 3 % of take. 2. Jute ligature, enveloping with bamboo leaf: It was adopted wisely in Taipei, Han and Changhawa prefectures in Taiwan. 83. 75 percentage of take was obtained under continuously fine days. But 55. 10 percentage of take was the result under rainy day. 3. Jute ligature, enveloping with polystyrene bag, piling with earth: The percentage of take of this combination was 96. 62 under fine weather. But very low percentage of take was gained under rainy days, due to the decay of jute string. The work of piling earth was also too complicate to achieve for large nuresry. 4. Jute ligature, enveloping with polystyrene bag and bamboo leaf: The percent-tage of take was 88. 17 under fine days. But only low percentage of take was obtained under rainy days, due to the too much moisture inside the polystyrene bag inducing the decay of the jute. 5. Polystyrene ligature, enveloping with polystyrene bag and bamboo leaf: By adopting the above combination for six years (up to 1961) under any condition of weather, the percentage of take were all above 60. This percentage is higher than those of old practices by using jute ligature, bamboo leaf or piling with earth. 6. Polystyrene ligature, enveloping with polystyrene bag: For the reason of white polystyrene admitting the ultra-violet rays increasing the chlorophyl of the new shoot, the speed of new shoot formation is increased faster than enveloping with bamboo leaf. 7. For the reason of the little drops of water in the polystyrene bag can bend the light, so the percentage of take is still high under strong sun light. 8. The best ligature for citrus veneer grafting in Northern part of Taiwan found out in this {{experiment was}} palystyrene string and enveloping with polysty-rene bag.

Cypress Creek and the Little Tallahatchie Canal were channelized and incised {{and had little}} woody cover; Puskus Creek was unchannelized and unincised and had abundant woody cover. We constructed three types of bundles (cane, <b>leaf,</b> and <b>string)</b> and deployed replicates of each in winter and spring. Occupancy of bundles by fish and crayfish was high and included 32 fish species representing eight families. Fish abundance did not differ among bundle types or between channel positions (bank or midchannel), but abundance of crayfish showed mixed responses to bundle type and position. Fish and crayfish use of bundles was higher in the channelized streams (89 % occupied) than in the unchannelized stream (49 % occupied). Furthermore, after a winter storm, fish use increased in the channelized streams {{but not in the}} unchannelized stream. Bundles yielded abundance estimates with modest to poor precision (40 - 73 % for fish; 37 - 125 % for crayfish); about 110 - 140 bundles would be necessary to consistently achieve precision of 30 %. Bundles were effective for sampling a subset of fish assemblages (e. g., darters Etheostoma spp. and Percina spp. and madtoms Noturus spp.), but other fish species were conspicuously underrepresented or absent in our samples relative to sampling by electrofishing and seine (e. g., openwater species and large individuals). Nevertheless, microhabitat bundles can be effective for sampling smal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIndoor {{handling}} of {{large amounts of}} plant materials occurs in different occupational settings including greenhouses and causes exposure to bioaerosols. The bioaerosol components fungi, β-glucan, bacteria and endotoxin are involved in different airway symptoms and health effects can be dose-dependent. Therefore, there is a persistent need to reduce exposure. The aims {{of this study were}} to identify tasks causing exposure and to evaluate preventive measures aimed at reducing exposure of greenhouse workers to bioaerosols, and to study factors affecting the exposure. We have focused on different exposure scenarios; one with high short-term exposure found during clearing of old cucumber plants; the other with long-term, mid-level exposure found during tomato picking, <b>leaf</b> nipping, <b>stringing</b> up tomato plants, and packaging of cucumbers. Clearing of non-dried cucumber plants compared with clearing of dried cucumber plants significantly reduced the exposure to dust, endotoxin, bacteria, fungal spores and β-glucan. More endotoxin and fungi are emitted and more of the emitted particles were of respirable size if the leaves were dried. Along the cucumber packaging line, exposure levels were highly specific to each personal subtask. The subtask ‘unloading of cucumbers’ was the source of exposure making task ventilation or shielding of the process a possibility. Elimination of leaf debris on the floor reduced the exposure to fungi significantly. However, leaf debris on the floor did not contribute significantly to the exposure to dust, endotoxin and bacteria. Furthermore, to eliminate leaf debris, it had to be cleared away and this was associated with a higher exposure to dust and endotoxin. The age of the plants affected the exposure level to bioaerosols with higher exposures from old plants. In conclusion, different tasks and subtasks cause very different exposure levels. It is possible to reduce exposure by identifying subtasks causing the exposure and by modifying work processes, e. g., not drying out of plants...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{stripping}} of burley {{tobacco is}} labor intensive and typically requires 50 to 75 worker hours per acre (wkr•hr/ac). The {{goal of the}} project was to reduce labor by optimizing <b>leaf</b> removal by <b>string</b> trimmer heads using combinations of strings lengths and motor speeds. In tests conducted on a single grade, all leaves outside the grade were removed by hand. Plants were run through the machine for sting lengths of 5, 7 and 9 inches and associated motor speeds which were monitored and recorded. Stripping efficiencies were calculated for each plant and collectively for each set of four plants. The machine was then tested for three grade stripping efficiency. Particle size analysis tests were run to determine potential losses due to leaf shredding. Efficiencies for single grade testing ranged from 93 to 96 % for optimal string length and speed combinations. Stripping three grades by machine resulted in an average of 97 % efficiency. Potential losses due to shredding accounted for 5. 6 % of the total weight mechanically removed. It is believed that this stripping concept, implemented on a full scale four grade basis, coul...|$|R
40|$|U crkvi Gospe Gusarice u Komiži na Visu kameni Gospin oltar pripisuje se radionici Bokanića. Nastao u prvom desetljeću 17. stoljeća, nosi sve odlike stila ove radionice. The {{professional}} {{activity of}} the Bokanić’s workshop, which during the 16 th and 17 th century was established in Dalmatia on the islands of Brač and Hvar, through Omiš, Trogir and Zadar, had also been recognized earlier {{on the island of}} Vis. The most famous member of this known family of builders and stonemasons was Trifun Bokanić, whom the Trogir’s historian Pavao Andreis, pointed out as early as the 17 th century, as the builder of {{the top floor of the}} Trogir bell tower. In Zadar, together with his father Jerko, Trifun built the altars in the Benedictine church of Saint Francis and Saint Mary (from 1841, in Nin), while in Hvar, he built the town loggia and the altar of Our Lady of Karmen in the cathedral (the altar was transported to the parish church in Brusje in 1750). Even after Trifun’s death in 1609, the members of this large and widespread family of stonemasons from Pučišća on the island of Brač, take part in building and ornamenting many of the secular and sacral buildings on Dalmatian islands and its mainland. For a long period of time, the island of Hvar was the main center of their professional activity. After the devastation by Algerian pirates in 1571, the whole town of Hvar, the whole island in fact, became a large building site, while the Hvar Cathedral, on which many craftsmen from the islands of Brač, Hvar and Korčula worked, becomes the source of widespread professional building activity in Dalmatia, where in the ascent of anti-reformation flows, many churches were built or restored. The craftsmen gathered around and “trained” on the Hvar Cathedral, played an important role in spreading a Late Renaissance and Mannerism style. While building stone altars and while participating in the construction of many private and public buildings, they were passing on and spreading new styles. On this occasion, one more stone altar on the island of Vis is attributed to the Bokanić’s workshop. The main altar, dedicated to the Madonna, is situated in the church of the Madonna of the Pirates, in its central and oldest part of the subsequently expanded church. The stone altar has a painted triptych with an attic showing the Madonna with Child and Saint Catherine of Sienna, flanked by side fields with saint Rocco and Saint Anthony the Abbot, and surmounted by the figure of God, Our Father. The altar is situated in a shallow apsidal niche of the central nave over which is a pointed vault. It is made of white limestone, polychromised and gold plated. It is of the architectural type: its columns and semi-columns carry the triangular gable framing the gold plated relief frame made of stone, in which there is a Renaissance painting. The emphases and the division of architectural elements of the altar, point to Renaissance characteristics. The traditional tripartite relation in the vertical compositions, stylobate, columns, and tripartite beams, still copies characteristics of antiquity. The choice of the ornamental motifs from the architectural (small consoles, cogs, astragal and ovulo moldings) to plant motifs (<b>leafs,</b> <b>strings,</b> rosettes, vines), surely points to the cinquecento style. However, the flat ornament “caught” the altar; still, there were no forms of the Baroque ornaments (cartilages, cartouches). The basic features of visual artistic relations of altars are characterized by steady and well balanced architectural parts, as well as in the proportionality (compatibility) of a structure and an ornament. Polychromy, and especially gilt, gave liveliness to the unity of the altar with a painting in relation to the natural color of the stone. The altar of the Madonna of the Pirates church bears recognizable characteristics of the Bokanić’s style (channelled columns, leafy ornaments, composite capitals), although some of the morphological elements are different when compared to altars Trifun made in Nin and Brusje. The altar of the Madonna of the Pirates church is for the first time mentioned in documents in 1625. The documents speak about the apostle visit of the Zadar archbishop Ottaviano Garzadori. In the bishop visit of the Madonna of the Pirates church in 1627, which instead of the Hvar bishop Petar Cedulin, was made by his apostle vicar, otherwise the canon from Chioggia, Pietro Morari, he found the church to be extended and remade. It can be concluded that the altar of the Madonna of the Pirates church could be made some time between years 1603 and 1625, when it was for the first time listed as altare lapideum. It is obvious that the Bokanićs were actively working in Komiža during the first decades of the 16 th century when they worked for the island of Hvar, and at the time, the island of Vis was a constituent part of the Hvar commune. Besides the altars, their professional activity can be also noticed on many architectural elements on churches in Komiža. A part of the arch made in Bokanić’s style and decorated with angels’ heads made in relief, was preserved in the yard of the complex of former Benedictine Abbey in Komiža that became the Church of Saint Nicholas. There is a big baptizing well (approximately 2 m high), made in the Bokanićs’ style with a pyramid and a balustrade on top, in the sacristy of the Baroque church of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows in Komiža. This monumental statuary carved part of the church set up requires special professional and scientific analysis. The wall tabernacle with brass door frames decorated with angels’ heads is in the same sacristy. It is identical to the consoles of the wall niches in Muster. Both, the well and the tabernacle, according to their dimensions, had to belong to the equipment of the Church of Saint Nicholas. Later on, during the “Baroqueisation” of the interiors, they were moved to the church of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows. We can also assume that the Bokanić’s did the complex constructional and stonemason jobs of expanding the churches of the Madonna of the Pirates and the church of Saint Nicholas. At the beginning of the 17 th century, former modest buildings with a single nave were rebuilt into complex churches with three naves. Both churches, the Madonna of the Pirates with its present three, joined facades and the monumental Muster, or the church of Saint Nicholas, were expanded between the years of 1603, when the visitor Priuli still describes them as buildings with a single nave, and 1627 when Pietro Morari describes them as already extended. The extension made with making arches in side walls, adding side naves and reshaping of the façade, have a recognizable profile of the workshop, with the insertion of the characteristic centralstone decorated with woman’s head...|$|R
