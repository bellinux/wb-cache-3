25|$|Marache {{was born}} in Meaux, France in June 1818, three years to the month after his namesake Napoleon Bonaparte's final defeat at Waterloo. Marache moved to the United States at around 12 years of age. He learned the game around 1844 and {{immediately}} became a serious student of the game. He <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> quickly that he was able, three weeks after his first lesson, to give his tutor rook odds.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the InterCity 125 are steeped in irony, because it was planned as a stop-gap. Research had begun for the tilting Advanced Passenger Train (APT) {{but it was not}} {{possible}} to predict when it could enter service. The HST would apply what had been <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> far to traditional technology - a parallel project based on conventional principles but incorporating the newly discovered knowledge of wheel/rail interaction and suspension design. Although the APT never achieved all its design objectives the InterCity 125 was an outstanding success.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|Tommy Handley died {{suddenly}} on 9 January 1949; the BBC {{decided that he}} was [...] "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" [...] of ITMA, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was [...] "one of the greatest radio performers we have ever known. I <b>learned...</b> <b>so</b> much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, [...] "don't you think it's about time we got married?" [...] The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar's Office. After a week's honeymoon in Southsea, {{she returned to the}} Players' where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{curriculum}} {{varies from}} country to country, but the training generally includes both theoretical and experiential learning. All course participants are introduced to the 1st Gilwell Scout group or Gilwell Scout Troop 1 (the latter name {{is used in the}} Boy Scouts of America and some other countries). In the Boy Scouts of America, they are also assigned to one of the traditional Wood Badge [...] "critter" [...] patrols. Instructors deliver training designed to strengthen the patrols. One-on-one work with an assigned troop guide helps each participant to reflect on what he has <b>learned,</b> <b>so</b> that he can better prepare an individualized [...] "ticket". This part of the training program gives the adult Scouter the opportunity to assume the role of a Scout joining the original [...] "model" [...] troop, to learn firsthand how a troop ideally operates. The locale of all initial training is referred to as Gilwell Field, no matter its geographical location.|$|E
500|$|Various {{writers have}} {{commented on the}} book. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it [...] "This sweet {{delightful}} book". The novelist Virginia Woolf observed that [...] "By some apparently unconscious device [...]. a door [...] left open, through which we hear distant sounds." [...] Among poets, Edward Thomas wrote that [...] "In this present year, 1915, at least, {{it is hard to}} find a flaw in the life he led" [...] while W. H. Auden stated that [...] "Selfishly, I, too, would have plumbed to know you: I could have <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] The naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough called White [...] "A man in total harmony with his world."

500|$|Aguilera {{revealed}} {{that some of}} the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque, stating, [...] "There is dancing, and I <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> much also as a dancer doing the 'Burlesque' film, moving my body in ways that were, I feel, never as precise before [...] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for 'Not Myself Tonight,' but it was really, really fun to take what I learned from the movie." [...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|The 2016 Summer Games marked Karma's Olympic début. She {{qualified}} for the women's individual archery tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripitate Commission in June 2016 based on her results at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships and the 2016 Archery World Cup qualification event in Antalya. In an interview with Kuensel before the Games, Karma said: [...] "I’m very excited and nervous at the same time. It is {{time for me to}} show what I’ve <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> far against the world’s best archers.”, and to Archer 360, [...] "While in the Sambodromo, I’m hoping to make my country proud. I have a good chance if I am able to maintain my home scores." [...] She competed on 5 August in the ranking round, finishing 60th out of 64th competitors with 588 points. Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition. After the events ended, Karma stated that despite being defeated she enjoyed the match and wanted to compete with archery champions whether she won or lost: [...] "I remember being a bit nervous with the big cameras in the blinds.

500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I <b>learned</b> <b>so</b> much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E
