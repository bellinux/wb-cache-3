25|$|The company's {{third and}} last {{production}} was Handel's Acis and Galatea (performed with The Masque of Love) which {{opened at the}} Great Queen Street Theatre on March 10, 1902. Shaw had convinced the theatre's owner, W. S. Penley, to let them rent it for only £40 a week. Nevertheless, the production's finances were precarious. The 1901 Dido and Aeneas revival had not made any profit, and Acis and Galatea had no working capital apart from two or three small donations from friends, including one of £10 from Walter Crane. With insufficient {{money to pay the}} stage hands and other creditors, the planned two-week run had to be curtailed to six performances. According to Craig, the creditors' agents called at the theatre on the <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> ensure that no property was removed and even searched the bags of the chorus members as they left. Ellen Terry eventually paid the outstanding bills, but the Purcell Operatic Society was essentially bankrupt, and with no funds forthcoming for future productions, finally had to close down.|$|E

And the local American Legion post presented him with a medal. The Bessemer Herald reported that “friends and admirers of Ralph Heikkinen [...] [...] [...] came {{from all parts of}} the Upper Peninsula <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> pay tribute to the football star.” The following day, he spoke to students in the assembly room of Bessemer high school where the school band gave a concert and Heikkinen was “given a boisterous welcome by the students.” ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} week, the show had already gained over 18 million viewers, beating out ABC's show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in ratings. After the season finale, Carter said that Survivor [...] "built over a 13-week run {{to what was}} {{expected}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> be the biggest single television audience ever assembled for a summer television series, far eclipsed every expectation the network had when it acquired {{the rights to the}} show last year." [...] Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television said that [...] "it has beaten our expectations by about double." [...] The finale of Survivor was watched by 51.7 million viewers, the second-highest viewership of any American television episode during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, exceeded only by the finale of Friends. The finale had higher ratings than the World Series, NBA finals, NCAA men's basketball finals, and Grammy Awards of that year. CBS was able to make the cost of commercial advertisers up to $600,000 during the season finale.|$|E
