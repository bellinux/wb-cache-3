5000|$|Grosset & Dunlap {{obtained}} {{permission from}} <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown,</b> to reprint Thornton Burgess's many children's books, and began issuing the [...] "Bedtime Stories" [...] series (20 books originally published 1913-1919, including such titles as The Adventures of Reddy Fox and The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel) in 1949. The original <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown</b> editions had plates {{of high quality}} paper for the illustrations, but the Grosset & Dunlap editions were to print the illustrations on the same stock as the text. They commissioned the original artist, Harrison Cady, to recreate the illustrations as line drawings appropriate for that type of paper, and to create many additional illustrations. Where the original <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown</b> editions had six full-page illustrations, the Grosset & Dunlap had 14 (fourteen) full-page drawings, plus many smaller drawings placed throughout the text. Cady had matured as an artist in the decades since the original <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown</b> illustrations. The line drawings he did for Grosset & Dunlap are simpler than the illustrations he had made for <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown,</b> and are generally more charming. The original <b>Little,</b> <b>Brown</b> illustrations better convey Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures.|$|R
