500|$|Charles {{had been}} in poor health for some time. After going {{shopping}} on a chilly day in Funchal to buy toys for Carl Ludwig, {{he was struck by}} an attack of bronchitis. This rapidly worsened into pneumonia, not helped by the inadequate medical care available. Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita (at the time eight months pregnant) helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April, his last words to his wife being [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] After his funeral, a witness said of Zita [...] "This woman really is to be admired. She did not, for one second, lose her composure... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral. They were all under her charm." [...] Zita wore mourning black in Charles's memory throughout sixty-seven years of widowhood.|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrical themes explore [...] "hate, {{ignorance and}} sexism", and AllMusic noted its feminist lyrics. According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you that they <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much, and they put you up on a pedestal and make you feel great, then they {{turn around and say}} 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] was inspired by a serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E

Doherty frequently posted about to Barât on the Libertines forum; in one post from 2003, referring to an incident in 1997 in which Barât had wanted to form a suicide pact, Doherty wrote: [...] "let's keep going i love you i <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] Speaking of his separation from Doherty in 2004, Barât revealed, [...] "There was one point where I very very nearly, just {{to be close to}} him, started taking full on heroin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles did {{not leave}} Madeira again. On 9 March 1922 he had caught a cold in town, which {{developed}} into bronchitis and subsequently progressed to severe pneumonia. Having suffered two heart attacks, he died of respiratory failure on 1 April, {{in the presence of}} his wife (who was pregnant with their eighth child) and nine-year-old Crown Prince Otto, remaining conscious almost until his last moments. His last words to his wife were [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much." [...] His remains except for his heart are still interred on the island, in the Church of Our Lady of Monte (Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Monte), in spite of several attempts to move them to the Habsburg Crypt in Vienna. His heart and the heart of his wife are entombed in Muri Abbey, Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|... "Something" [...] {{was also}} a Top 10 US hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles of this period {{included}} the hit [...] "Never Never Never", an English version of the Italian [...] "Grande grande grande", reaching the Top 10 in the US Adult Contemporary Chart, the UK Top 10 and No. 1 in Australia and South Africa. The success of [...] "Something" [...] (single No. 4, album No. 5 in the UK) spawned a series of successful albums on the United Artists label, including Something Else (1971), And I <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> <b>So</b> (1972), I Capricorn (1972), Never Never Never (1973), Good, Bad but Beautiful (1975), Love, Life and Feelings (1976), You Take My Heart Away (1977) and Yesterdays (1978). Additionally, two of Bassey's earlier LPs also entered the charts in the '70s: And We Were Lovers (1967, re-issued as Big Spender), and Let's Face the Music (1962, re-issued as What Now My Love).

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> <b>So</b> Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t let you go / I’ll be your friend / I will <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America. The young couple {{maintained}} their intimacy through letters. Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely to have somebody, even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more than everybody on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> <b>so</b> much with every day, every hour more and more. I wish it were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise. Soon Maria Pavlovna was once again looking forward with enthusiasm to a new life. The wedding took place at Tsarskoye Selo on [...]|$|E
