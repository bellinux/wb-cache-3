500|$|Keeping in {{line with}} the most {{prominent}} theme of Beyoncé, [...] "Rocket" [...] explores frank female sexuality. It opens with Beyoncé expressing feelings of lust in the first line, [...] "Let me sit this assssss [...] on ya" [...] for which she adopts a soft and sultry vocal style. She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let me take this off while you watch me / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks about how their evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If you <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do all that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She {{also noted that the}} album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{was written}} by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Claude Kelly, while {{produced}} by Luke and Blanco. Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] put the whole album together as far as what I wanted my show to be <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> play with a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California. Background vocals were provided by Cathy Dennis, Kelly and Myah Marie. Main instrumentation was done by Luke and Blanco. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia. [...] "Circus" [...] was announced on October 31, 2008, as the second single from the album, and was officially serviced to American radio stations on December 2, 2008.|$|E
500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you <b>like,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E

The film, entitled , was directed by Bruce Hendricks and produced by Art Repola. The film compiled some of the show's performances, along with backstage footage. Cyrus said Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was made for individuals who did not attend a concert during the tour due to ticket scalping.

It became the highest box office total for Super Bowl weekend, the highest-grossing opening for a three-dimensional film, and highest per-screen average ever– $42,000 per screen. It went on to gross over $42.8million in its entire opening week, becoming the highest-grossing film of that week and the film with the fewest theaters to debut at number one. Following its commercial success, the film's run was extended; it eventually closed on May15,2008, playing in theaters for 15 weeks. With a total gross of $70.6million worldwide, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was once the highest-selling concert film of all time, until surpassed by Michael Jackson's This Is It (2009), which sold over $189million worldwide.|$|E
