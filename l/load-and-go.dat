40|$|Emergency medical {{services}} (EMS) has evolved greatly since its inception. The model {{has gone from}} a <b>load-and-go</b> philosophy to one that integrates high-level medical knowledge and techniques. As the practice of prehospital medicine evolves, these models must also evolve to provide good care. This requires efficient utilization of resources and placement of these resources {{in areas that are}} quickly accessible to those in need. A proposed solution has been to dispatch units based on screening by 911 call-takers. EMS response can be grouped into two categories: uniform and tiered. Uniform response means an advanced life support (ALS) unit is always dispatched. A tiered response sends first responders, basic life support (BLS) units, and/or ALS units depending on how the caller answers a series of questions asked by the dispatcher. Persse et al. investigated the difference in survival of patients in the uniform versus tiered response areas within a single, large system. Survival rates for those with out-of-hospital ventricula...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the use of cell phones and PDAs as {{teaching}} tools and target platforms for teaching undergraduate computer science. The advantages are numerous and compelling. Cell phones and PDAs are less expensive than PCs. Many students may already have one. The devices support <b>load-and-go</b> course material that students can access anytime and anywhere, including short breaks. With network connectivity, students can use them to collaborate in groups. As a target platform for applications, students can show their work to friends and family, and can use the applications they create in their daily lives. Finally, with {{so much of our}} software being developed in far-away places, cell phones present unique economic opportunities for local content and micro-market applications, especially in developing countries. In this paper we discuss the advantages and opportunities in greater detail, discuss development tools appropriate for students and instructors, and discuss some of the courses currently being taught on PDAs. We find many low or no cost tools available for programming with handhelds. We also find many schools that have started to use handhelds in their courses. Never-the-less, handhelds are still novelties that requires special instruction aside from the main material in the curriculu...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of spaceborne earth observation (EO) {{to meet some}} of the requirements for urban monitoring is high but not fully recognized. Especially the {{potential of}} radar interferometry for the urban application domain is not yet evaluated. The main objective of the project described in this paper was to analyze the benefits and the limitations of ERS-InSAR data analysis for urban monitoring. The evaluation focuses on three main applications: monitoring small surface movement (e. g. subsidence, dunes, crustal movements), change detection analysis (urban sprawl monitoring) and the generation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Using the technology of repeat-pass radar interferometry, there are three different products to process for the urban application domain: Coherence, DEM and differential InSAR. The method of InSAR processing was tested at two validation sites, Cairo and Taipei, which are different in size and urban structure and which are also located in different climatic and vegetation zones. The results of the interferometric analyses have finally to be integrated into urban information systems for further value adding processing or thematic analyses. In future, the recently available ready-to-use interferometric products (e. g. Spot Image Coherence products) will reduce the complex processing effort required to use radar interferometry data. There will be a <b>load-and-go</b> solution to simply use interferometric products in urban monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prehospital {{resuscitation}} {{for patients}} with major trauma emphasizes a <b>load-and-go</b> principle. For traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) patients, the administration of vasopressors remains under debate. This study evaluated the effectiveness of epinephrine in the prehospital setting {{for patients with}} TCA. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a prospectively collected registry for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Taipei. Enrollees were ≥ 18 years of age with TCA. Patients with signs of obvious death like decapitation or rigor mortis were excluded. Patients were grouped according to prehospital administration, or lack thereof, of epinephrine. Outcomes were sustained (≥ 2 h) recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to discharge. A subgroup analysis was performed by stratified total prehospital time. Results: From June 1 2010 to May 31 2013, 514 cases were enrolled. Epinephrine was administered in 43 (8. 4 %) cases. Among all patients, sustained ROSC and survival to discharge was 101 (19. 6 %) and 20 (3. 9 %), respectively. The epinephrine group versus the non-epinephrine group had higher sustained ROSC (41. 9 % vs. 17. 6 %, p < 0. 01) and survival to discharge (14. 0 % vs. 3. 0 %, p < 0. 01). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of epinephrine effect were 2. 24 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 05 - 4. 81) on sustained ROSC, and 2. 94 (95 % CI 0. 85 - 10. 15) on survival to discharge. Subgroup analysis showed increased ORs of epinephrine effect on sustained ROSC with a longer prehospital time. Conclusion: Among adult patients with TCA in an Asian metropolitan area, administration of epinephrine in the prehospital setting was associated with increased short-term survival, especially for those with a longer prehospital time...|$|E
40|$|For the {{computer}} Zebra we have undertaken {{a project of}} con-structing an Algol translator {{with the aim of}} being as complete as possible (with the only exception of own variable arrays). As a few new concepts are used in this design, it is thought to be useful to communicate them in this form. Zebra is a two address machine with a very limited fast store and a reasonable drum store of 8192 words. The operation code is a rather peculiar one. Every bit of the 15 bits of the function part of an instruction is used separately for a different elemen-tary function. The operations are in fact micro-operations and more complicated actions such as multiplication, division, list searching, etc. are not built in functions but can be readily pro-grammed. This makes the code extremely powerful for just those operations which are required for an Algol translator. On the other hand it is not the appropriate object language for Algol. Therefore we decided to create a new object language within the machine which is used interpretatively. The structure of this object language (called Intermediate Code or IC) is fully adapted to the requirements of Algol. The analytic code of Zebra helps a great deal in making the interpreter fast and c 0. npact. Another reason why an interpretive code is not such a drawback is that the machine has no built-in floating point operations so that these have to be programmed anyway. The system as a whole works on a <b>load-and-go</b> basis. First the translator is put into the machine, into {{the upper end of the}} store and the Algol program is then fed in, translated and built up in the lower part of the store. Then the interpreter over-writes the translator and the program can start working. We shall distinguish these phases by the names translate phase ~nd run phase...|$|E
