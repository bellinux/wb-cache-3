500|$|Warfarin is {{more slowly}} acting than the common {{anticoagulant}} heparin, {{though it has}} a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (an antibody-mediated decrease in platelet levels), which increases the risk for thrombosis. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a half-life time of days). Warfarin's long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped. [...] Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below). For these main reasons, hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially, the heparin covering the 3–5 day <b>lag</b> <b>period</b> and being withdrawn after a few days.|$|E

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} to this study. First, <b>lag</b> <b>periods</b> do not directly indicate {{the duration of}} stone formation. <b>Lag</b> <b>periods</b> indicate the association between daily temperatures and urolithiasis events. We observed an increasing RR of urolithiasis after <b>lag</b> <b>periods</b> of high temperature. High temperature might cause early occurrence of the urolithiasis event. High temperature could cause the previously formed asymptomatic stones to become symptomatic or aggravate new stone nucleation. Second, there may be confounding factors due to the difference in urban and rural areas. The difference may be applicable to age, lifestyle, diet, income, activity and occupation, which may be extrinsic factors of urolithiasis (Ramello et al. 2000; Scales et al. 2012). Unfortunately, no information was provided about dietary habits {{of the population of}} different areas in our study and {{it is very difficult to}} estimate the lifestyle and diet habits for whole population in South Korea. Diet is the other main determinant of stone formation and it is reasonable to suppose that people living in the rural area could have different dietary habits than people living in the towns who often did not take their meals at home. Also age distribution could be different in different areas and it could be that populations in the urban areas were younger and more prone to stone formation. Air-conditioned indoor condition and heat exposure outdoor condition in the same region can have other effects on urolithiasis (Ramello et al. 2000; O’Neill and Ebi 2009). Lastly, the inclusion and the exclusion criteria could be a source of bias, which are patients with chronic urolithiasis which come at the control after more than 30  days and there are persons with congenital urolithiasis which is not dependent on the climatic area. Unfortunately, no information was provided from Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) in our study. More studies in different populations are needed to confirm the physiology of urolithiasis caused by change in climatic factors under the control of other extrinsic factors.|$|R

The findings show that Turkish textile export categories exhibit evidence of strategic pricing behaviour when the Turkish textiles export data is analysed for different frequencies. The results show that evidence of strategic pricing behaviour is observed in response to changes in real exchange rates for textile exports for closer <b>lagging</b> <b>periods</b> and strategic pricing behaviour diminishes with further <b>lagging</b> <b>periods.</b> Also, evidence of strategic pricing behaviour is observed in a more recurrent fashion with higher frequency data, three-month periods, than with relatively lower frequency data, six-month and 12 -month periods. Another interesting finding is that Turkish textile exporters prefer to increase their prices as a reaction if they had adjusted their prices in an overshooting fashion in response to real exchange changes in the previous period. The most important finding of the paper is that while Turkish textile exporters prefer to adjust their export pricing without fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation and by increasing their relative markups for some textile categories, they prefer to adjust their export prices by lowering their markups in addition to fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation for some other textile categories in order to increase their market share overseas. ...|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{provide the}} first {{characterization}} of myonectin, with in vitro and in vivo {{evidence that it}} is a novel myokine with important metabolic function. Unlike the other CTRPs characterized to date, myonectin (CTRP15) is expressed and secreted predominantly by skeletal muscle.... (Our) results suggest that myonectin is a nutrient-responsive metabolic regulator secreted by skeletal muscle in response to changes in cellular energy state resulting from glucose or fatty acid fluxes. Many metabolically relevant secreted proteins (e.g. adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and RBP) and the signaling pathways they regulate in tissues are known to be dysregulated in the condition of obesity. The reduction in expression and circulating levels of myonectin in the obese state may represent yet another component of the complex metabolic circuitry dysregulated by excess caloric intake. Although exercise has long been known to have profound positive impacts on systemic insulin sensitivity and energy balance, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. That voluntary exercise dramatically increases the expression and circulating levels of myonectin to promote fatty acid uptake into cells may underlie one of the beneficial effects of physical exercise.... A modest rise in the circulating levels of myonectin resulting from recombinant protein administration is sufficient to lower serum NEFA without altering serum triglyceride levels. Unlike CTRP1, CTRP3 and CTRP12, injection of recombinant myonectin into mice appears to have no glucose-lowering effect. Reduction in circulating NEFA is not due to suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis; rather, it results from increased fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and hepatocytes. Although the myonectin-mediated enhancement of lipid uptake in vitro appears modest (25-50%), in fact, the magnitude of this effect is comparable with cells stimulated with 50 nM insulin, a saturating dose that leads to maximum increase in fatty acid uptake.... In accordance with myonectin mediating its metabolic effect through a transcriptional mechanism, a reduction in circulating NEFA in mice occurred only 2 h after recombinant protein injection, a <b>lag</b> <b>period</b> presumably required for mRNA and protein synthesis." ...|$|E
