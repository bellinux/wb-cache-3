60|$|The chief {{difficulty}} (for {{there are}} other inconsiderable ones) on this view, is the fact,--as far as I can trust two continuous <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> carefully taken between Santa Cruz and the Falkland Islands, and several scattered observations on this and other coasts,--that the pebbles {{at the bottom of}} the sea QUICKLY and REGULARLY decrease in size with the increasing depth and distance from the shore, whereas in the gravel on the sloping plains, no such decrease in size was perceptible.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{two years}} of sea service—spent in screw sloops-of-war [...] and [...] and the steamer —then {{required}} before commissioning—Eberle was promoted to ensign on July 1, 1887. Brief duty in Washington, D.C., {{in the late summer}} and early autumn preceded his reporting to [...] on November 22, 1887 to begin three years of duty in that Fishing Commission steamer. During his time on the Albatross, commanded by then Captain Z. L. Tanner, he participated in running <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> around Cape Horn, charting the fishing banks off the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, and assisting in developing the Tanner Sounding Device.|$|R
5000|$|While the [...] "mother" [...] {{survey ship}} would take {{soundings}} in deep water, [...] "chicks" [...] (smaller boats, initially rowed and later steam-powered) would run <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> {{from the shore}} to deep water, using a lead line. Sounding positions were fixed by reading sextant angles between the three nearest control points, and were then plotted on a field chart. Soundings were taken at all stages of the tide, and were later corrected for {{the height of the}} tide to reduce them to a common datum (a quantity or set of quantities that serve as a reference or basis for calculation of other quantities). On completion of a survey, the tides and datum were related to a permanent bench mark for use in future surveys.|$|R
60|$|The general result therefore, {{at which}} we arrive, is that the great islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo {{resemble}} in their natural productions the adjacent parts of the continent, {{almost as much as}} such widely-separated districts could be expected to do even if they still formed a part of Asia; and this close resemblance, joined with the fact of the wide extent of sea which separates them being so uniformly and remarkably shallow, and lastly, the existence of the extensive range of volcanoes in Sumatra and Java, which have poured out vast quantities of subterranean matter and have built up extensive plateaux and lofty mountain ranges, thus furnishing a vera causa for a parallel <b>line</b> <b>of</b> subsidence--all lead irresistibly to the conclusion that at a very recent geological epoch, the continent of Asia extended far beyond its present limits in a south-easterly direction, including the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, and probably reaching as far as the present 100-fathom <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>soundings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Waterwitch was {{converted}} {{for use as}} a survey vessel, which included replacing her engine and boilers to provide 450 horsepower. She commissioned in 1894 for service on the Australia Station, undertaking a series of surveys on passage to the Cape of Good Hope. Once on station she made <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> in Esperance Bay, Fiji and the Tasman Peninsula in preparation for the running of telegraph cables. Between 1898 and 1907 she worked the coast of China, including Hong Kong, Weihaiwei and the Yangtze River. In early 1900 Commander Willoughby Pudsey Dawson was in command, succeeded by Lieutenant W. O. Lyne when she was re-commissioned on 16 February 1900. She formed part of the British naval contingent involved in relieving the Peking legations during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and surveyed the north channel of the Yangtze prior to the battleship 's navigation of the river. In 1902 Lieutenant and Commander Ernest Clifford Hardy was in command.|$|R
5000|$|After {{concluding}} that the boundary between Botswana and Namibia around Kasikili/Sedudu Island follows the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> deepest <b>soundings</b> in the northern channel of the Chobe and that the island formed part of the territory of Botswana, the Court recalled that, {{under the terms of}} an agreement concluded in May 1992 (the [...] "Kasane Communiqué"), the two countries had undertaken to one another that there shall be unimpeded navigation for craft of their nationals and flags in the channels around the island.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} whether clear air turbulence (CAT) which caused a brief, intense turbulence encounter to a jetliner might have been related to gravity waves generated by a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> thunderstorms, local <b>sounding</b> data taken within two hours of the incident {{have been used as}} input to a numerical model designed to simulate stratified flow over obstacles. In the model a rigid obstacle at the lower boundary acted as the source of the gravity waves. The model results show a large amplitude disturbance localized over the obstacle at and above flight level, in regions where CAT would be expected. Stratification studies have been conducted, varying the height and shape of the obstacle and the input wind profile. The success of the experiment leads to the conclusion that atmospheric gravity wave simulation can be useful in understanding and possibly avoiding CAT...|$|R

40|$|The {{required}} number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> for geotechnical {{site investigation}} depends on different {{factors such as}} geology of the site, soil variability {{and the type of}} project to build. Indications on the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> are given in codes of practice (Eurocode 7 [...] .) but they focus mainly on a minimal number which depends only on the area of the project. Geotechnical investigation is a process conducted, in general, in two steps. The first step consists in collecting available information and executing a limited number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> on site, while the second step of investigation is based on the first and requires more soundings for soil testing. The preliminary information is expressed by using random sets of the influencing factors (soil variability, geology [...] .). Intervals of values are proposed by experts (engineers) concerning the influence of each factor based on preliminary information from site (soil variability, geology, type of project). The expert proposes an interval of values based on his degree of belief. Using Eurocode 7 recommendations for site soundings, an “objective function” f(X) is constructed to rely “soil variability” to the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings.</b> It permits constructing the random set and obtain the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> by unit area for each expert (engineer). The same reasoning is applied with other parameters such as geology and an inference system is obtained. Information is aggregated from the available parameters (Soil variability, Geology [...] .) and the random sets computed from which upper and lower probabilities (probability boxes) are built. They permit optimizing the number <b>of</b> <b>soundings</b> to be carried out on site. Author preprin...|$|R
