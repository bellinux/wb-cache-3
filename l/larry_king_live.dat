5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt.

Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live.

Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Live,</b> the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while.
