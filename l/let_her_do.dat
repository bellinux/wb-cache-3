500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact}} that Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her, yet who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{comeback}} {{with lead}} single [...] "Applause" [...] from the album, Gaga performed few {{songs from the}} record at the iTunes Festival in London in September 2013. One of the songs, known as [...] "I Wanna Be with You", was performed as an acoustic version on the festival; Gaga called it an ode to her fans and about how much she had missed them while recuperating from the surgery. The song, later renamed to [...] "Dope", was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Dino Zisis and Nick Monson and produced by Gaga and Rick Rubin. Described by Gaga as an electronic ballad, [...] "Dope" [...] was revealed to be [...] "the evolution of a fan song that became a deep confession in me." [...] In an interview with Kiss FM (UK) Gaga said that [...] "Dope" [...] was the most personal song she had ever created. Feeling that the album needed something more autobiographical and confessional and a song which would show her vulnerable side, Gaga worked with Rubin who <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> the song {{in the way she}} wanted and just assisted in recording it. He had contacted Gaga for producing the track, while she was on her sabbatical; Gaga consulted with Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, her main producer for Artpop and then decided to enlist Rubin's help. [...] "'Dope' is actually about me battling all sorts of addiction since I was growing up", she explained to the interviewers.|$|E

6000|$|Imogene {{threw herself}} on Colville's' breast. It {{gave him a}} shock, {{as if he were}} <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> herself some wrong. But she gripped him fast, and began to sob and to cry. [...] "Oh! oh! oh!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ion {{was educated}} at Penwortham Girls Grammar School near Preston, Lancashire {{in the same}} year as Nancy Rothwell. As a young student, she enjoyed science, which her parents {{encouraged}} by <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> chemistry experiments in the family's kitchen.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh! we did as we could. We tried {{reading the}} things Mr. Wilmot had marked, {{but she was}} too restless; her hands would wander off to the letters, caressing them, and she would go back to talk of him--all his ways from a baby upwards. I hope there was no harm in <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> it, for if there is {{anything}} to do one good, it is his noble spirit.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Crawford despaired at the {{attention}} Margaret was getting, writing to friends: [...] "Could you this year only ask Princess Elizabeth to your party?... Princess Margaret does draw all {{the attention}} and Princess Elizabeth <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] Elizabeth, however, did not mind this, and commented, [...] "Oh, it's so much easier when Margaret's there—everybody laughs at what Margaret says". King George described Elizabeth as his pride and Margaret as his joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} the boy slowly, [...] "with girls it's just different. Girls of my size everybody does things for. There's Clemmy,--she's {{only two years}} older nor me, and don't know half that I do, and yet she kin lie about all day, and hasn't {{to get up to}} breakfast. And Phemie,--who's jest the same age, size, and weight as me,--maw and paw <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> everything she wants to. And so does everybody. And so would you." ...|$|R

50|$|George Barnert Callender, {{playwright and}} an {{excellent}} swimmer, is at Marvis Bay {{for the production of}} his play Fate's Footballs, shortly to be put on there. He is on the pier, dwelling on the play's troubles, particularly its star Arthur Mifflin, when he sees a very attractive girl in the water. Straining to follow her as she swims beneath him, he falls from the pier, and is just about to swim off when she grasps him and begins to drag him to shore. He <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> this, hoping to form an acquaintanceship, and on the shore they meet and she offers to teach him to swim.|$|R

5000|$|Patty {{is one of}} the flar-ta pack animals {{the company}} employs. While similar to the wild flar-ke beasts the flar-ta are much more docile, though Patty seems to have some flar-ke DNA in her (as seen in her {{tendency}} to fight mean and not run away from a fight). Roger develops an unusual rapport with the beast that allows him to use her as a war steed, plowing his way through enemies and <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> most of the work. It is Roger who gives her this human name since she reminds him of a [...] "Patricia" [...] he once knew in boarding school.|$|R
5000|$|A year later, {{as a gift}} to {{her fans}} and to commemorate her 19th anniversary, Harrison {{released}} a music video for the fan favorite [...] "Coolin'".

6000|$|... "I--I forgot!" [...] she moaned. [...] "Tommy, you are angry!" [...] She hugged him, and he <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> it, but all {{the time}} he was looking over her head fixedly, with his mouth open.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is not necessary," [...] his {{companion}} answered. [...] "I {{have been to}} Somerset House. I have seen the will. One hundred thousand pounds she has, in her own right, unalienable.

6000|$|... "I do believe, Lionel," [...] said Marian, [...] "that {{you could}} do more for her than any body else. If you would but {{sometimes}} <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>do</b> things for you, ask her to help you, as--as you ask me." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{bringing}} Brenda Leigh Johnson {{in for the}} job, he doesn't {{seem to want to}} <b>let</b> <b>her</b> actually <b>do</b> <b>her</b> work.

6000|$|... "It {{is useless}} to say that," [...] his mother {{answered}} with an impatient look of sorrow. [...] "You don't {{know how bad}} it has been here with us all these weeks, Clym. You don't know what a mortification anything of that sort is to a woman. You don't know the sleepless nights we've had in this house, and the almost bitter words that have passed between us since that Fifth of November. I hope never to pass seven such weeks again.
