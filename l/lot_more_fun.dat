It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman {{gave the}} film a C– rating, praising Petty's {{performance}} {{which he said}} was the only good part of an otherwise [...] "amateurish" [...] film. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Janet Maslin gave moderately positive reviews, with Rosenbaum concluding: [...] "unless you're a preteen boy who hates girls, it's funnier and a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than Batman Forever." [...] Maslin wrote: [...] "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy." [...] Leonard Klady from Variety gave a mixed review, saying: [...] "What's missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits.

[...] The Times critic Dominic Maxwell thought the [...] "languid timing that Gervais brings to Extras and The Office was wrong here.

[...] Maxwell did find the episode entertaining though, stating that [...] "it was a decent late-period Simpsons episode" [...] and that it featured [...] "some fine jokes."

I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while.

500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> in small doses.)" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun,</b> too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks.

The song was subsequently placed at #73 in the same publication's list of [...] "Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s". Stylus also placed it in its Top 50 Singles of 2005 (this time at #44), praising the band's ability to [...] "play tug of war between typical pop dynamics and the skewed perspective of experimental music".

500|$|In {{the writing}} of {{previous}} albums by Rolo Tomassi {{a majority of the}} music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For Astraea, the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the [...] "main brains". In January 2012, in an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. The choice of returning to Sanderson was because he has been a close friend of the band members for a long time. Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be [...] "more direct and heavier", but also noted that the band [...] "will never shy away from being experimental". However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather just having a say in every aspect of the album progress. In April 2012, the NME did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was [...] "70% complete". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan [...] "breathed new life" [...] into the band's writing as the original three members had become [...] "too set in their ways". The band members have commented that this has made the writing a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> as the band no longer writes a song then learns it. As the band wrote Astraea they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's singing.|$|E
500|$|Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it [...] "manages brilliantly to nod to {{just about}} every Whovian in-joke, {{demographic}} and fetish within the span of two tiny installments". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to watch" [...] than the two in the sixth series episode [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that {{the ending of the}} miniepisodes relied on [...] "too-easy, dated, sexist humor". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's short skirt rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a [...] "responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was [...] "cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was [...] "derivative and lazy" [...] and a [...] "missed opportunity". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf [...] "Future Echoes", and felt that Moffat could have written something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the [...] "blokey humor" [...] was [...] "misplaced", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: [...] "Pond, put some trousers on!". Despite this, both Jusino and Burk enjoyed the scene where Amy flirts with herself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrasting}} reviews, Film Threats Chris Gore {{said of the}} film, [...] " [...] delivers everything great foreign films should—action, sex, compelling characters, clever filmmaking, it's unpretentious (a {{requirement for}} me) {{and it has a}} story you can follow without having to read those annoying subtitles. I can't rave about this film enough—this is passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the best foreign films, heck, one of the best films I have seen", while Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader stated, [...] "About as entertaining as a no-brainer can be—a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun,</b> for my money, than a cornball theme-park ride like Speed, and every bit as fast moving. But don't expect much of an aftertaste." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a <b>lot</b> warmer, <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from James L. Brooks, who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as {{traveling}} to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy, who in turn cannot stand her family. Believing {{that it would be}} a tough episode to write, Brooks gave the job to Greg Daniels, who was enthusiastic about it and has said that it was a <b>lot</b> easier and <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to write than expected. The plot involving Homer's cuff links was not in the original draft; it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh's disdain for the Simpson family. The end theme was redone by Alf Clausen as a [...] "Renaissance version", including a harp.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone staff {{called it}} a [...] "summer club banger". Writers from Billboard thought Payne [...] "seems to be aiming for a DJ Mustard/Tyga vibe," [...] and {{concluded}} that [...] "the song's fun: The swaggering, Directioner-baiting pre-chorus especially, which is probably the JT-est thing any of the five members have done since going solo." [...] Comparing it to One Direction's catalogue, Jordan Harris from Express and Star opined it [...] "is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> danceable, incredibly <b>fun</b> to listen to" [...] and added, [...] "Another similarity, and one which Liam {{would do well to}} use as a benchmark going forward, is the vocal style of Justin Timberlake." [...] In Digital Spy, Laurence Mozafari wrote [...] "the song screams of trying to be grown up." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future.

[...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death.

2500|$|The album {{so far has}} a {{score of}} 66 out of 100 from Metacritic based on [...] "generally {{favorable}} reviews".

[...] John Hanson of Sputnikmusic gave the album a score of 4.5 out of five and called it [...] "simply an immense album." [...] Uncut gave it a score of four stars out of five and called it the band's [...] "most digestible record yet." [...] Blender also gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, [...] "Never before have these kings of experimental metal sustained such pulse-quickening energy, honing their tricks--cryptic lyrics, cliffhanging cries, spine-twisting rhythms--into a screaming arrow of sound." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Most of the time, however, the band makes a righteous racket that straddles the worlds of prog rock, funk, fusion jazz and world music, with Eastern motifs spicing 'Aberinkula' {{and a bit of}} cosmic blues making its way into 'Conjugal Burns.'" [...] Vibe likewise gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "Rarely does rock music feel so simultaneously orchestrated and raw." [...] Shilpa Ganatra of Hot Press gave it a positive review and said, [...] "The manner in which the group weave complex musical tapestries is certainly impressive from a purely technical perspective, but you suspect that they were a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to assemble than they are to listen to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> of the words right.

Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 1½ out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "an amiable but disjointed film that {{identifies}} too closely with its heroes.

2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} {{described}} as {{similar to that of the}} output of Warner Bros Cartoons in the Golden Age: a visually driven show heavy on humor, sight gags, and good animation. Instead of a finished script, the animators usually received a three-page outline, requiring them to come up with a majority of the gags and dialogue. The animation team appreciated this approach, with storyboard artist Jeff Myers, formerly of The Simpsons, quoted as saying [...] "The script [...] was carved in stone. Here it's [...] more of a challenge and a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> when we're given a rough outline." [...] Murray's animation lacked parallel lines and featured crooked architecture similar to various Chuck Jones cartoons. In an interview he stated that his design style contributed to the show's [...] "wonky bent feel". Jean Prescott of the Sun Herald described the series as [...] "squash-and-stretch". A 1993 Houston Chronicle article described the series' setting as having a [...] "reality that is 'squashed and stretched' into a twisted version of real life". The background staff hand-painted backgrounds with Dr. Martin Dyes, while each episode title card consisted of an original painting. Linda Simensky said that she asked the creators of Rocko's Modern Life about why the women in the series were drawn to be [...] "top-heavy", the creators told her that they believed that drawing women [...] "the traditional way" [...] was easier.
