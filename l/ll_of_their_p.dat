40|$|International audienceNovel mixed phosphole-fluorene π-conjugated {{systems have}} been {{prepared}} using the Fagan-Nugent route.

The use of these derivatives as emitters in OLEDs strongly depends on the substituent linked on the P-atom.

We construct structured P 2 P functional modules, including network communication components, P 2 P topology maintenance and routing, network bootstrapping, as well as pluggable pub/sub services in our system.

40|$|Members of the pacifastin {{family are}} serine {{peptidase}} inhibitors, found in arthropods and have many members within different insect orders. Based on their structural characteristics, inhibitors of this peptide family {{are divided into}} two groups (I and II).

Methods Antiretroviral-naive patients who achieved a viral load < 50 HIV- 1 RNA copies/ml after induction therapy with twice-daily (bid) lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and fixed-dose zidovudine (ZDV) /lamivudine (3 TC) (CBV) were randomly assigned to continue CBV/LPV/r or switch to fixed-dose ZDV/ 3 TC/abacavir (TZV). Patients completed standardized questionnaires on adherence, treatment satisfaction and QoL at randomization (between weeks 12 and 24) and at weeks 48, 72 and 96. Results Patients on CBV/LPV/r were more likely to have skipped medicines in the last week (P = 0. 035) and during the preceding weekend (P = 0. 027) than patients on TZV. Patients on CBV/LPV/r were significantly less satisfied with the convenience <b>of</b> <b>their</b> treatment (<b>P</b> = 0. 004) and tended to be less satisfied with the side effects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> treatment (<b>P</b> = 0. 091) and continuation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> present treatment (<b>P</b> = 0. 056) than patients on TZV.
