5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, <b>lanternfishes,</b> and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, <b>lanternfishes,</b> bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including <b>lanternfishes,</b> bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
25|$|Sampling via deep {{trawling}} {{indicates that}} <b>lanternfish</b> account {{for as much}} as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, <b>lanternfish</b> are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of <b>lanternfish</b> is 550–660 million metric tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. <b>Lanternfish</b> also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of <b>lanternfish</b> swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.|$|R

5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably <b>lanternfishes</b> in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} prey {{of the brown}} lanternshark are bony fishes (mainly <b>lanternfishes),</b> followed by cephalopods (mainly the squid Watasenia scintillans), and finally crustaceans (mainly prawns such as Acanthephyra). A known parasite of this shark is a species of copepod in the genus Lerneopoda.|$|E
500|$|The slender smooth-hound {{is likely}} a {{schooling}} species. It preys {{on a variety}} of benthic fishes and invertebrates, and also scavenges; human garbage has been reported among its stomach contents. Small bony fishes, <b>lanternfishes</b> in particular, are the most important prey type, followed by decapod crustaceans. Cephalopods, gastropods, isopods, brittle stars, dogfish sharks, and cartilaginous fish egg capsules may also be consumed. On the Challenger Plateau, cephalopods are an important food source for juveniles under [...] long.|$|E

500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, <b>lanternfishes,</b> filefishes, triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|E
500|$|As generalist predators, velvet bellies feed on {{crustaceans}} (e.g. pasiphaeid {{shrimp and}} krill), cephalopods (e.g. ommastrephid squid and sepiolids), and bony fishes (e.g. shads, barracudinas, <b>lanternfishes,</b> and pouts). Sharks off Italy also eat {{small amounts of}} nematodes, polychaete worms, and other cartilaginous fishes. Studies of velvet bellies off Norway and Portugal, and in the Rockall Trough, have found small sharks under [...] long feed mainly on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the small fish Maurolicus muelleri. As the sharks grow larger, their diets become more varied, consisting mainly of squid and the shrimp Pasiphaea tarda, as well fishes other than M. muelleri. It has been speculated that smaller velvet bellies may be too slow to catch fast-moving cephalopods. The cephalopod diet of adults overlaps {{with that of the}} Portuguese dogfish; the latter species may avoid competition with the velvet belly by living in deeper water. The bite force exerted by the velvet belly is only around 1 N.|$|E
2500|$|The {{smooth lanternshark}} feeds on squid, <b>lanternfishes,</b> smaller dogfish sharks, and fish eggs. This species is ovoviviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos being sustained by a yolk sac. Females produce {{an average of}} 10 young per reproductive cycle. Males reach sexual maturity at a length of , and females at a length of [...] The length at maturity varies with geographical region, with sharks in the western Atlantic maturing larger than those from off KwaZulu-Natal. This species grows at a slow rate, with the body becoming relatively longer with age. Off southern Portugal, males live to at least 13 years of age, and females to at least 17 years.|$|E

2500|$|Small bony fishes, {{including}} <b>lanternfishes,</b> hakes, grenadiers, rockfishes and lightfishes, {{comprise the}} bulk of the African sawtail catshark's diet. Squid and crustaceans may also be consumed. A known predator of this species is the southern African frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus africana). Unlike other members of its genus, the African sawtail catshark is aplacental viviparous, with females retaining eggs internally until they hatch. There is apparently no defined breeding season, and mating and birthing occur throughout the year. Adult females have two functional uteruses and produce litters of up to 12 young; litter size increases with female size. The developing embryos are initially sustained an external yolk sac, and emerge from the egg at between [...] long. Pigmentation begins to develop at an embryonic length of [...] At around [...] long, the embryos have well-developed external gills, which largely disappear by the time they are [...] long. Near-term fetuses weigh over twice as much as eggs, suggesting some form of secondary maternal provisioning during gestation. The newborns measure [...] long.
