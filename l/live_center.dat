50|$|In woodturning, one {{variation}} of a <b>live</b> <b>center</b> is a cup center, {{which is a}} cone of metal surrounded by an annular ring of metal that decreases the chances of the workpiece splitting.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of cup centers. The {{woodworking}} variety is a variation of the traditional <b>live</b> <b>center.</b> This type of cup center has a central point like a normal <b>live</b> <b>center</b> and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup center has a tapered hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter {{of the end of the}} part, rather than using a center hole.|$|E
50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a <b>live</b> <b>center</b> in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A <b>live</b> <b>center,</b> which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is usually}} used to apply {{support to the}} {{longitudinal}} rotary axis of a workpiece being machined. A lathe center is mounted in the tailstock, and inserted against the sides of {{a hole in the}} center of the workpiece. A tailstock has a Dead Center, while headstock has <b>Live</b> <b>Center.</b> A Tailstock is particularly useful when the workpiece is relatively long and slender. Failing to use a tailstock can cause [...] "chatter," [...] where the workpiece bends excessively while being cut.|$|E
50|$|A pipe center, {{also known}} as a bull nose center is a type of <b>live</b> <b>center</b> which has a large {{diameter}} conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center {{to be used in the}} bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter opprevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the chuck end.|$|E
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a <b>live</b> <b>center,</b> as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the <b>live</b> <b>center</b> flexibility on the form errors in lathe operations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the free vibration response, transient response and optimal {{design of a}} lathe under transient conditions. The optimal design is based on minimizing the maximum dynamic displacement response of the system. [...] The differential equation of motion characterizing the behaviour of a lathe spindle-workpiece system is formulated based on the Euler-Bernoulli's equation. The matrix differential equation of motion is obtained using finite element technique. The boundary condition at the <b>live</b> <b>center</b> is taken as hinged connection. In order to economize on CPU time and memory, the system matrices are condensed by using the dynamic condensation technique. [...] The free vibration response {{of the system is}} studied by varying parameters such as the bearing spacing, the bearing stiffness etc. The effects of these variations on the static deflection, the natural frequencies and the rate of decay of free oscillations of the system are analyzed. The condensation of the system matrices is done by selecting the appropriate number of masters by comparing the natural frequencies of the condensed and uncondensed systems. The free vibration response of the system is studied by assuming the initial velocity vector to be equal to zero. [...] A method comprising of the finite element technique and modal analysis is used for studying the system behaviour under transient cutting conditions. The response of the system due to an impulse and exponentially decaying pulse excitations is obtained. The effect of the variations of system design variables on the maximum dynamic displacement response is presented. Based on these variations the optimal values of the variables are obtained. [...] An optimal design of the lithe spindle-workpiece system using a nonlinear programming technique with bearing spacing, bearing stiffness and location of an external damper is obtained. The minimization of the maximum dynamic displacement response of the system is chosen as the objective for this optimization scheme. The optimal values of the design variables obtained by single parameter optimization are then compared with those obtained by multi-parameter optimization...|$|E

40|$|Research {{supports}} {{a positive relationship}} between living-learning communities and students’ academic accomplishments and personal development. Successful communities reflect the institution’s mission, and the institution’s purpose and goals are adapted for the student population the communities serve. Living learning communities provide a sense of belonging, which is critical for students to persist in college to realize their full personal and academic potential. With limited research concerning living-learning communities and honors students, {{it is difficult to determine}} which characteristics of living-learning communities positively affect honors students. This document examines the relationship between the living-learning community (Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center)</b> and honors students at Grand Valley State University. The findings indicate honors students who participate in the Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> perceive themselves to be more socially connected to their community and the campus, and are more involved in activities outside the classroom, than honors students living off-campus. The difference is less significant between honors students living in the Niemeyer <b>Living</b> <b>Center</b> and honors students living elsewhere on-campus...|$|R
