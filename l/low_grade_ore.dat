50|$|In {{the chapter}} above from the Gold Hill Daily News, it states that <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>ore</b> {{is valued at}} $26 - $28.00 to the ton. It also states that (after {{transportation}} and milling costs, 'yield under the stamps') {{the result would be}} around $17.00 to the ton coming back to the mine. Milling rates were about $7/ton. Based on an average of $27/ton of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>ore,</b> that left a freight cost of $3/ton. That one ton of ore could pay the wages for 3 experienced underground miners and a carpenter for a day. So you use your <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>ore</b> to pay expenses, and reap the profits from the high grade. With the coming of the railroad, a reduction in freight rates for lumber by almost half occurred, and the railroad could haul more material by the trainload, so mining activity would increase, creating more business for the railroad.

It {{is well known that}} <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> iron <b>ores</b> contain high amount of gangue minerals and combined water. Biomass waste (aka agro-residues) from the palm oil industry is an attractive alternative fuel to replace coal as the source of energy in mineral processing, including for the treatment and processing of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> iron <b>ores.</b> Both iron ore and PKS were mixed with minute addition of distilled water and then fabricated with average spherical diameter of 10 - 12 mm. The green composite pellets were subjected to reduction test using an electric tube furnace. The rate of reduction increased as temperature increases up to 900 °C. The Fe content in the original ore increased almost 12 % when 40 mass % of PKS was used. The reduction of 60 : 40 mass ratios of iron ore to PKS composite pellet produced almost 11. 97 mass % of solid carbon which was dispersed uniformly on the surface of iron oxide. The aim of this work is to study carbon deposition of PKS in iron ore through reduction process.
