Sir James Gambier, Ambassador to the , had a natural son, James FitzJames, RN, well known to the Gambier family, who styled him the 'Knight of Snowden'. As Captain of HMS Erebus, he accompanied Sir John Franklin on his disastrous attempt to discover the North Pole in 1845, and shared his leader's fate.

In an out of court arbitration settlement he received £5,000, a relatively small amount considering his large financial losses. John Meares managed to acquire possession of Barkley's nautical gear, his journal and <b>log-book.</b> Frances Barkley later wrote, [...] "Capt. Meares, however, with the greatest effrontery, published and claimed the merit of my husband’s discoveries therein contained, besides inventing lies of the most revolting nature tending to vilify the person he thus pilfered." [...] Other maritime fur traders such as George Dixon and Robert Haswell, condemned Meares for failing to properly credit Barkley's discoveries.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{continue}} a dialogue regarding the possible future use of <b>log-books</b> during training. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has been considering their use at various stages of training in psychiatry. Cole & Scott (1991) rejected <b>log-books</b> as a tool for self-audit during registrar training because they were often not kept up to date. The situation in higher professional training is more complex; there is not the clear focus of studying for the Membership examination and there are many more training com ponents to cover during a four year period. Thus, we feel that a system for self-audit and monitoring could well prove valuable at the senior registrar level.

2500|$|In 1852 Goncharov {{embarked}} on a long journey through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia, on board the frigate Pallada, as a secretary for Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin, whose mission was to inspect Alaska and other distant outposts of the Empire, and also to establish trade relations with Japan. The <b>log-book</b> which it was Goncharov's duty to keep served {{as a basis for}} his future book. He returned to Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1855, after traveling through Siberia and the Urals, this continental leg of the journey lasting six months.

2500|$|Darrell Ward, Art Burke, and Lisa Kelly {{drive for}} Polar. Todd Dewey {{switches}} from VP Express to Polar.

[...] After a tense verbal exchange with Polar owner Mark Kohaykewych, Darrell quits Polar in episode 5, frustrated with repeated truck breakdowns and how few loads {{he has been}} given, and goes into business for himself. [...] Joey Barnes appears in episode 10 to escort Burke on a delivery run through the Manitoba wilderness, after Burke avoided being fired after [...] his truck the previous trip. [...] Also in episode 5, Burke was fined $490 and [...] "shut down" [...] (suspended from driving) for three days, due to multiple <b>log-book</b> infringements and over-working, from being stuck in the snowstorm on the previous round trip. [...] In episode 12, Kelly, Burke, Dewey, Darrell and Reno all make it to Fort Severn, while Kelly decides to support Darrell and help him go further into Peawanuck. [...] Kelly was not censured by Mark for her actions, as it was [...] "a morally and ethically right thing to do," [...] and she was offered a job by Darrell for the next season; she was undecided on switching sides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the terms of a contract, but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it looked like it was [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams Mr Williams sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged <b>log-book)</b> said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a contract term a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often the two measures coincide.|$|E
