5|$|Linnaeus {{stayed with}} Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{to return to}} Sweden. Illness and the {{kindness}} of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.|$|E
5|$|She {{inherited}} {{her beauty}} and singing voice from her mother, a former operatic contralto and successful women's clothier who in her younger years was widely {{considered to have}} been one of Ireland's most beautiful women. O'Hara noted that whenever her mother <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> men would leave their houses just so they could catch a glimpse of her in the street. O'Hara's siblings were Peggy, the oldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot, and Jimmy. Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, becoming a Sister of Charity.|$|E

He apologises for his wrong deeds and proposes her. She accepts his proposal and Rao is relieved.|$|E
5|$|During the 19thcentury {{the estate}} was again {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} the estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works.

Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available.

5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} of the fence. On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Corder <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Maria {{set out to}} {{meet him}} at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E

5|$|Sophie/Dogface Victoria Reade (born 18 May 1989) is a glamour {{model from}} Nantwich, Cheshire, has {{appeared}} in Hot Shots Calendar and was {{the winner of the}} series. Reade changed her name by deed poll to Dogface, to become a house-mate during the show's first week. On Day 33 Big Brother told Reade that she had to remain silent until 2am as punishment for discussing nominations; she failed to keep quiet and therefore faced the public vote. Reade had a romantic relationship with Kris in the House. On Day 39 she and Siavash were punished by Big Brother for talking about nominations, and told they were not allowed to swear before 3pm; they both failed and faced eviction. On Day 72, as a special prize, Dogface (Reade) legally changed her name back to Sophie. Since Day 88, Sophie was the bookies' favourite to win. She <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E
5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, having been built around 1343, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. The great hall was added in the 15th century and the Oriel Room in the 16th. Various renovations were undertaken during the 16th and 17th centuries after which the house fell into disrepair with the north range being demolished by the early 19th century. In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets bought the house and restored it in a period style, furnishing it with fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles, along with historic and period paintings. On his death in 1948 he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|The main {{television}} coverage of Big Brother 10 was screened using daily highlights programmes, narrated by Marcus Bentley. These episodes summarised {{the events of}} the previous day in the House. Alongside these highlights shows were spin-off programmes, Big Brother's Big Mouth and Big Brother's Little Brother, that commented on fandom, cultural reaction to the events within the House and included interviews with celebrities, former housemates and family and friends of housemates. On Fridays, a live eviction programme was hosted by Davina McCall in which the evicted contestant <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and received an interview from McCall and two guests. For 2009, BBLB returned with George Lamb presenting five weekday evening programmes and one Sunday edition per week. Big Mouth was also fronted by McCall and was broadcast on E4 on Friday nights for an hour after the main eviction programme.|$|E

Towards the end of the Empire the population decreased; people <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> terraces, and <b>the</b> slopes being no longer suitable for agriculture were used as cemeteries. At the same time walls went up surrounding the hilltop with material from <b>the</b> deserted <b>houses.</b>|$|R
5|$|The priory was {{established}} as an Augustinian foundation in the 12thcentury, and {{was raised to}} the status of an abbey in 1391. The abbey was closed in 1536, as part of the dissolution of the monasteries. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the manor of Norton, were purchased by SirRichard Brooke, who built a Tudor house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18thcentury by a Georgian house. The Brooke family <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928. In 1966 the site was given in trust {{for the use of the}} general public.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E
