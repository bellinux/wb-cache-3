Mortality {{was assessed by}} field exposure of laboratory-laid eggs for two days and by monitoring of field-laid eggs. Egg disappearance, the major mortality factor, was low {{in the first four}} weeks after transplanting and then increased. Egg parasitism by Trichogrammajaponicum was highest {{at the start of the}} crop and decreased to a low level towards crop maturity. Non-hatching of eggs was of minor importance. Over the total duration of the egg stage, the average disappearance of exposed laboratory-laid eggs was 40 %, and of field-laid eggs 46 %. Egg mortality due to parasitism averaged 15 % and 18 %, respectively. The potential impact of egg parasitism is probably partly obscured by the disappearance of parasitized eggs. Mortality rates were highly variable between egg cohorts, but with multiple regression analysis several factors were identified that statistically explained a significant part of this variation. The results suggest that the predatory crickets Metiochevittaticollis and Anaxipha longipennis play a major role in egg disappearance, and that egg parasitism is positively dependent on the overall density of host eggs of Trichogramma in the field...|$|R

The LF population was initiated at about 25 standard meteorological weeks (SMW), improved at first slowly up to 27 SMW then steadily up to 32 SMW attaining the maximum at about 34 SMW which was maintained up to about 37 SMW. The population then subsumed at first slowly up to 40 SMW then abruptly. Abiotic conditions such as minimum temperature, temperature gradient, maximum relative humidity and average relative humidity had significant positive influence on C. medinalis population.

40|$|Rodents are an {{important}} pre-harvest pest of lowland irrigated rice. Estimates of the area of damage to rice crops by 17 important rice pests were collected every week by the Plant Protection Department of An Giang province in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. We examined 5 years of data to reveal that rodents were ranked fourth with 4. 2 % of rice crop area damaged compared to brown plant hopper (16. 7 %), rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> (12. 1 %) and leaf blast (5. 2 %). The area damaged by rodents increased from 2. 1 % in the first rice crop (winter–spring) to 3. 8 % in the second (summer–autumn) and 6. 6 % in the third rice crop (autumn–winter). The pattern of rodent damage was higher {{during the middle of}} the crop and lower at the beginning and the end of the crop, which reflects the energy requirements of breeding females and the ecology of the rodent species. Rodent damage was estimated to cause yield loss of up to 15 %. These data will be used in crop modelling and economic modelling to determine appropriate timing and cost-effectiveness of management...|$|E
30|$|Using MAS based {{conventional}} breeding, {{progress has}} been made in pyramiding two or more major BPH resistance genes into susceptible cultivars. The pyramided lines (PLs) carrying Bph 1 and bph 2 genes showed higher resistance than the lines with only bph 2 (Sharma et al. 2004). Qiu et al. (2012) used MAS for pyramiding Bph 6 and Bph 12 genes into japonica and indica cultivars. The PLs had stronger resistance level than ILs with Bph 6 alone, followed by the single-Bph 12 ILs. In addition, three dominant BPH resistance genes (Bph 14, Bph 15, Bph 18) were pyramided into the elite indica rice 9311 and its hybrids using MABC. The results showed an additive effect of those pyramiding genes, the order of the gene effect being 14 / 15 / 18 [*]≥[*] 14 / 15 [*]>[*] 15 / 18 [*]≥[*] 15 [*]>[*] 14 / 18 [*]≥[*] 14 [*]≥[*] 18 [*]>[*]none (Hu et al. 2013). Additionally, pyramiding BPH resistance genes and other resistances have become routine in rice breeding. Wan et al. (2014) reported development of a new elite restorer line possessing tolerance to BPH, stem borer, <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> and herbicide through pyramiding Bph 14, Bph 15, Cry 1 C, and glufosinate-resistance gene bar.|$|E
30|$|In India, 28 {{different}} species of Trichogramma and Trichogrammatoidea have been recorded. Among them, T. chilonis (Ishii) and T. japonicum (Ashmead) are the highly successful ones for pest management in tomato, sugarcane, cotton, and rice ecosystems, while T. achaeae Nagaraja and Nagarkatti has showed promising results against Achaeae janata (Linn.) (Noctuidae) on castor. Trichogramma cordubensis Vargas and Carbellois is an exotic species, which is used world-wide to control Autographa gamma (L.), Chrysodeixis chalcites (Esper), Phlogophora meticulosa (L.), Peridroma saucia (Hübner), Xestia c-nigrum (L.), and Noctua pronuba (L.) (Garcia et al. 1995; Lingappa and Hegde 2001; Singh et al. 2001; Lalitha and Ballal 2015). Trichogrammatoidea bactrae Nagaraja was tested against rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and emerged {{out to be a}} highly promising bioagent (Perera et al. 2015). In India, T. chilonis is considered as the most promising indigenous species which has a wider host range and high survival capacity. Hence, in the present study, three strains of T. chilonis (viz. Nilgiris, Kodaikal, and lab) along with five other potential species (T. cordubensis, T. japonicum, T. achaeae, T. embryophagum Hartig, Tr. bactrae) were chosen to develop a suitable storage protocol for their continuous mass production and also to cater to their appropriate delivery by minimizing their hatching rate in transit.|$|E
40|$|Biopesticides {{are a good}} {{alternative}} to the synthetic pesticide. Both leaves and fruit of neem plant {{are known to have}} bitter taste having fungicidal, insecticidal and nematicidal properties. Azadirachtin, chemically a tetranorterpenoid component of neem acts on the mitotic cells and blocks the microtubule polymerization. Certain activities of genes and proteins are also altered by azadirachtin. As a botanical insecticide azadirachtin is effective against many biological processes. It may cause a reduction in feeding habit, suspend the molting process, larvae and pupae death and also cause sterility in the emerging adults, this all depend on the given dose. Apart from azadirachtin, many other components of neem also have insecticidal properties. Among them are saponins that are found to have antimicrobial activity that inhibits moulds and protecting plant from attack of insects. Likewise Nim 80 and Neemas are also neem products that produce the insecticidal activity. In addition Parker oil TM is also effective insecticide which is a commercial product. There is a maximum weight loss when azadirachtin and NPV are used in combination. Commercial neem formulation has been assayed for the control of pine weevil in forestry, against rice <b>leaf</b> <b>folder,</b> root-knot nematodes and P. xylostella. Azadirachtin-A is extremely sensitive to the presence of sunlight different mechanisms have been used to increase its photo stability...|$|E
