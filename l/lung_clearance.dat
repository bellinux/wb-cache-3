2500|$|Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, {{has been}} {{classified}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The {{findings of the}} IARC {{are based on the}} discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired <b>lung</b> <b>clearance,</b> cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized. Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice. The mechanism by which [...] may cause cancer is unclear. Molecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to [...] results from the interaction between [...] nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment, independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{antimony}} {{and its compounds}} on human and environmental health differ widely. The elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired <b>lung</b> <b>clearance,</b> lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony.|$|E
50|$|The {{total body}} {{clearance}} will be equal to the renal clearance + hepatic clearance + <b>lung</b> <b>clearance.</b> Although for many drugs the clearance is simply considered as the renal excretion ability, that is, {{the rate at which}} waste substances are cleared from the blood by the kidney. In these cases clearance is almost synonymous with renal clearance or renal plasma clearance. Each substance has a specific clearance that depends on its filtration characteristics. Clearance is a function of glomerular filtration, secretion from the peritubular capillaries to the nephron, and re-absorption from the nephron back to the peritubular capillaries. Clearance is variable in zero-order kinetics because a constant amount of the drug is eliminated per unit time, but it is constant in first-order kinetics, because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time changes with the concentration of drug in the blood. The concept of clearance was described by Thomas Addis, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.|$|E

We instilled 100 ml of autologous serum either alone or with a beta-adrenergic agonist (terbutaline, 10 (- 5) M, or epinephrine, 5. 5 X 10 (- 6) M) into one lower lobe. After 4 h both terbutaline and epinephrine increased <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance.</b> The increase in <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> was inhibited when propranolol (a beta blocker) or amiloride (a sodium channel blocker) {{was added to the}} terbutaline. Increased clearance was not explained by changes in pulmonary hemodynamics, pulmonary blood flow, or lung lymph flow. We conclude that beta-adrenergic agonists increase <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> in anesthetized intact adult sheep. This increase is mediated through beta receptors and probably depends on increased active transport of sodium across the alveolar barrier...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> {{rates are}} reduced during sleep in {{patients}} with asthma. Methylxanthines and beta 2 agonists {{have been shown to}} enhance rates of <b>lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance.</b> This study examined whether oral slow release bronchodilators may also have an effect on this clearance mechanism during sleep {{in patients with}} asthma. METHODS: Nine patients with asthma with a mean(SE) age of 65 (5) years and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 of 61 (9) % participated in a double blind, placebo controlled, within subject crossover study to assess the effect of two weeks of treatment with salbutamol (Volmax; 8 mg twice daily) or theophylline (Phyllocontin; 350 mg twice daily) on <b>lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> during sleep. <b>Lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> rates were measured by a radioaerosol technique. RESULTS: The observation period for radioaerosol clearance was approximately 0. 3 hours before sleep, 6. 0 hours during sleep and 0. 6 hours after sleep. Mean mucociliary clearance rates for theophylline, placebo and salbutamol before sleep were: 39, 39, and 32 %/hour respectively; during sleep: 11, 10, and 9 %/hour respectively; and after sleep: 39, 32, and 35 %/hour respectively.

This study examines whether oral antibiotics have a detectable effect on this clearance mechanism during exacerbation in patients with such disease. Twelve patients with a mean ± se age of 63 ± 2 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to assess the effect of 1 week of treatment with amoxycillin (500 mg t. d. s.) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg b. d.) on <b>lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> during exacerbation. <b>Lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> rates were measured by a non-invasive radioaerosol technique. Both drugs on average resulted in small, non-significant, enhancement of mucociliary clearance.

Sputum production was also significantly reduced (P< 0 · 01) in both groups. The magnitude of improvement in <b>lung</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> was relatively modest following 1 week of treatment with either antibiotic. Since the number of coughs was significantly less after ciprofloxacin treatment the measured enhancement of lung mucociliary transport is probably, however, an underestimate...|$|R

40|$|Investigation of <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> of 99 mTc-labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) in smoking sarcoid {{patients}} {{has been}} impeded by difficulties to differ between pathology of clearance kinetics caused by sarcoidosis and by smoking.

This {{study was designed}} to test whether DA (10 � 5 M) would increase <b>lung</b> edema <b>clearance</b> in rats exposed to 100 % O 2 for 64 h. Active Na � transport and <b>lung</b> edema <b>clearance</b> decreased by approximately 44 % in rats exposed to acute hyperoxia (p � 0. 001). DA increased <b>lung</b> edema <b>clearance</b> in room air breathing rats (from 0. 50 � 0. 02 to 0. 75 � 0. 06 ml/h) and in rats exposed to 100 % O 2 (from 0. 28 � 0. 03 to 0. 67 � 0. 03 ml/h). Disruption of cell microtubular transport system by colchicine blocked the stimulatory effect of DA on active Na � transport in control and hyperoxic rats, whereas the isomer �-lumicolchicine, which does not affect cell microtubular transport, did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of dopamine. The Na,K-ATPase � 1 -subunit protein abundance increased in the basolateral membranes of alveolar type II (ATII) cells incubated with 10 � 5 M DA for 15 min, probably by recruiting Na � pumps from intracellular pools. Colchicine, but not �-lumicolchicine, prevented the recruitment of � 1 subunits to the plasma membrane by DA. Accordingly, DA restored lung ability to clear edema in hyperoxic-injured rat lungs.

In 25 cystic fibrosis patients and 25 matched controls, we computed the <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> index and also quantified curvilinearity of the washout concentration curve, where curvilinearity is equal to 0 (linear in semilog plot) reflects homogeneous ventilation and curvilinearity equal to 1 corresponds to the presence of an infinitesimally slowly emptying lung unit. In the cystic fibrosis group (forced expiratory volume in 1 s 27 - 100 % predicted), <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> index and curvilinearity average-SD values were 10. 3 ? 2. 3 and 0. 57 ? 0. 13, respectively, and were significantly different from control values (6. 2 ? 0. 4 and 0. 18 ? 0. 07; both p< 0. 001); <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> index and curvilinearity were also correlated (R= 0. 67; p< 0. 001). The average curvilinearity value in the cystic fibrosis group was found to be compatible with a cumulative volume of underventilated lung of 40 - 50 %, depending on the simulation scenario considered. The degree of washout curvilinearity observed here indicates that a major determinant of the abnormal <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> index values observed in adult cystic fibrosis patients is ventilation heterogeneity generated between convection-dependent lung units, while the remainder of <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> index abnormality with respect to normal controls potentially represents the small airways within these lung zones.

The influence of surfactant on 99 mTc-tobramycin <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> rates was studied dynamically with a gamma-camera in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing animals and in mechanically ventilated animals. The results show that instillation of 99 mTc-tobramycin with use of surfactant as vehicle significantly increases 99 mTc-tobramycin <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> compared to instillation of 99 mTc-tobramycin solution alone (P= 0. 006 between the two spontaneously breathing groups of animals and P= 0. 02 between the two ventilated groups of animals, ANOVA for repeated time measurements).

40|$|Chronic alcohol {{consumption}} {{is associated with}} increased incidence of ICU-related morbidity and mortality, primarily from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. One explanation is that alcohol regulates epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) via oxidant signaling to promote a pro- injury environment. We used small rodent models to mimic acute and chronic {{alcohol consumption}} and tested the hypothesis that ethanol (EtOH) would affect <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> by up-regulating ENaC activity in the lung. Fluorescence labeling of rat lung slices and in vivo mouse lung revealed an increase in ROS production in response to acute EtOH exposure. Using western blots and fluorescein- 5 -maleimide labeling, we conclude that EtOH exposure modifies cysteines of α-ENaC while data from single channel patch clamp analysis confirm that 0. 16 % EtOH increased ENaC activity in rat alveolar cells. In vivo <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> demonstrated a latent increase in fluid clearance in mice receiving EtOH diet. Ethanol mice given a tracheal instillation of LPS demonstrated early <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> compared to caloric control mice and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice.

40|$|Introduction: Caesarean section (CS) {{rates are}} {{increasing}} worldwide and pre-labour CS {{do so at}} the highest rate. Although CS undoubtedly save some lives, it is equally true that higher neonatal mortality and morbidities, particularly in relation to lung adaptation at birth, are associated with this mode of delivery. Despite recognition that clearance of the liquid filling the fetal lung is an essential step {{in the establishment of}} effective postnatal air-breathing, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of neonatal respiratory morbidity after CS are still under debate. We therefore lack insight for development of novel approaches to improve respiratory outcome in the newborn infant, the primary neonatal pathology. Objective: To summarises up-to-date clinical and animal research providing insight into the effect of delivery mode on <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> and on respiratory adaptation at birth. Method: A non-systematic translational pathophysiologic review based on the last 30 years of experimental data to corroborate clinical epidemiological findings. Review: The bulk of research in perinatal lung adaptation and respiratory distress at birth has focused on surfactant. Little translational research has put <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> into clinical context, yet it is known that infants delivered by CS have more liquid left in the airspaces of their lungs compared to infants born vaginally at a similar gestational age. Both, the regulation of lung volume during gestation, and the influence of labour and mode of delivery on perinatal <b>clearance</b> of <b>lung</b> liquid, {{have a major impact on}} how the lung becomes adapted for birth. Transformation of the lung, from its fetal state of liquid secretion to its neonatal mode, when it is in essence a dry organ of air breathing, is crucial for gas exchange. The importance of this change, on which all organs count for vital oxygenation, depends on several distinct but connected physiological changes that are linked to labour. The review will provide explanations for diverging results in the past and consider the timing of <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> via the two available pathways, one across the alveolar epithelium, the other through the airways. As a final goal, the review will provide clinicians involved with perinatal issues with up-to-date understanding of the physiology of fetal <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> and how lack of labour through CS delivery affects neonatal lung adaptation at birth. Conclusion: Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that pre-labour birth not only results in relative prematurity, but additionally curtails the extent of <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> that occurs in a normal vaginal delivery at term. Although steroids can be used to improve maturation of the pulmonary gas exchange ‘machinery’, the active expulsion of lung liquid via the airways appears to relate to the occurrence of uterine contractions, while the normal trigger for trans-epithelial liquid absorption in the ante- and post-natal lung depends on a labour-induced adrenaline surge...|$|R

Alveolar deposition, however, assessed in terms of particle retention at 24 hours, was significantly (p less than 0. 01) less in the smokers. Given the similarity of initial deposition, this implies that an increased proportion of small conducting airways are protected by mucociliary defence in the smokers' <b>lungs.</b> <b>Clearance</b> from conducting airways of the peripheral zone in tests with relatively high peripheral deposition (14 tests on smokers, and 12 on non-smokers) nevertheless proceeded at the same rate in smokers as in non-smokers...|$|R
40|$|The lung {{possesses}} specific {{transport systems}} that intra- and extracellularly maintain salt and fluid balance necessary for its function. At birth, the lungs rapidly transform into a fluid (Na(+)) -absorbing organ to enable efficient gas exchange. Alveolar fluid clearance, which mainly depends on sodium transport in alveolar epithelial cells, {{is an important}} mechanism by which excess water in the alveoli is reabsorbed during the resolution of pulmonary edema. In this review, we will focus and summarize {{on the role of}} ENaC in alveolar <b>lung</b> liquid <b>clearance</b> and discuss recent data from mouse models with altered activity of epithelial sodium channel function in the lung, and more specifically in alveolar fluid clearance. Recent data studying mice with hyperactivity of ENaC or mice with reduced ENaC activity clearly illustrate the impaired <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> in these adult mice. Further understanding of the physiological role of ENaC and its regulatory proteins implicated in salt and water balance in the alveolar cells may therefore help to develop new therapeutic strategies to improve gas exchange in pulmonary edema...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{microvascular}} injury {{has become}} a recently studied phenomenon that {{may be responsible for}} most of the complications associated with the lungs. Thirty patients undergoing partial hemilaminectomy or discectomy due to hernia of nucleus pulposus underwent Tc- 99 m HMPAO <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> as well as Tc- 99 m pertechnetate lung scintigraphy pre-operatively, and following general anaesthesia with halothane and isoflurane (third, fourth and tenth post-operative days). The results were compared with conventional techniques and haemodynamic parameters during the peri-operative period. In order to demonstrate acute phase changes under general anaesthesia and to perform pathological examinations, 21 New Zealand rabbits underwent radionuclide studies with Tc- 99 m HMPAO or Tc- 99 m pertechnetate. Lung biopsies were also performed. Despite no significant differences in any of the conventional diagnostic techniques, Tc- 99 m pertechnetate lung scintigraphy was performed for both the halothane and isoflurane groups, and Tc- 99 m HMPAO <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> was performed for the isoflurane group preor post-operatively. Tc- 99 m HMPAO <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> was impaired significantly in the halothane group on the third post-operative day (half time: 6 · 4 ± 1 · 6 pre-operative and 13 · 76 ± 3 · 3 s, P< 0 · 001) decreasing to pre-operative levels on the tenth post-operative day. Acute phase exposure to halothane was characterized with extremely abnormal Tc- 99 m HMPAO <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> in rabbits with respect to isoflurane, diminishing to control levels on the third day (half time: 8 · 7 ± 86 control and 28 · 65 ± 4 · 6, P< 0 · 001). Pathological examinations also demonstrated endothelial damage on acute exposure in the halothane group. General anaesthesia with halothane may give rise to alveolar microvascular injury, which generally seems to be underdiagnosed and may lead to serious post-operative complication...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} determine whether symptom free patients with previously diagnosed extrinsic allergic alveolitis had signs of inflammation in the lung. Pulmonary clearance of inhaled technetium- 99 m labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) was measured in seven patients {{with a history of}} extrinsic allergic alveolitis but with no symptoms {{at the time of the}} study and in 12 control subjects. Monoexponential clearance curves were obtained in all 12 control subjects. In contrast, <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> was abnormal in five of the seven patients: biexponential clearance curves were noted in four and an abnormally rapid monoexponential curve in one. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in all patients. Fluid from the second and third aliquots showed increased concentrations of albumin and urea in fluids from the patients, suggesting increased plasma leakage through the alveolocapillary membranes. More eosinophils and more eosinophil cationic protein were also found in the lavage fluid from the patients. The trend towards increased numbers of eosinophils in patients with abnormal <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> of DTPA suggests that this may be due to a continuing inflammatory reaction. Lung inflammation was also suggested by the fact that less leukotriene B 4 was secreted by cultured alveolar macrophages obtained from patients than by control macrophages. It is concluded that symptom free patients with previous extrinsic allergic alveolitis have continuing alveolar disease as shown by <b>lung</b> <b>clearance</b> and lavage findings...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that <b>lung</b> edema <b>clearance</b> was stimulated by dopamine (DA). The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether the DA-mediated stimulation of edema clearance occurs via an adrenergic or dopaminergic regulation of alveolar epithelial Na,K-ATPase. When isolated perfused rat lungs were coinstilled with DA and SCH 23390 (a specific D 1 receptor antagonist), there was a dose-dependent attenuation of the stimulatory effects of DA. Coinstillation with S-sulpiride (a specific D 2 receptor antagonist) or propranolol (a �-adrenergic antagonist) did not alter DA-stimulated clearance. Similarly, the specific dopaminergic D 1 agonist fenoldopam increased <b>lung</b> edema <b>clearance,</b> but quinpirole (a specific dopaminergic D 2 agonist) did not. 125 I-SCH 23982 binding studies suggested that D 1 receptors are expressed on alveolar type II (ATII) cells with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of 4. 4 nM and binding maximum (Bmax) 9. 8 pmol/mg. Consistent with these results, the D 1 receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detected in ATII cells by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism involving the activation of dopaminergic D 1 receptors which mediate...|$|R
40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) {{is essential for}} sodium homoeostasis in many epithelia. ENaC activity is required for <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> in newborn animals and for maintenance of blood volume and blood pressure in adults. In vitro {{studies show that the}} ubiquitin ligase Nedd 4 - 2 ubiquitinates ENaC to regulate its cell surface expression. Here we show that knockout of Nedd 4 - 2 in mice leads to increased ENaC expression and activity in embryonic lung. This increased ENaC activity is the likely reason for premature fetal <b>lung</b> fluid <b>clearance</b> in Nedd 4 - 2 −/− animals, resulting in a failure to inflate lungs and perinatal lethality. A small percentage of Nedd 4 - 2 −/− animals survive up to 22 days, and these animals also show increased ENaC expression and develop lethal sterile inflammation of the lung. Thus, we provide critical in vivo evidence that Nedd 4 - 2 is essential for correct regulation of ENaC expression, fetal and postnatal lung function and animal survival. Natasha A. Boase, Grigori Y.

40|$|A [ReO(Amino) 2 OH] complex was {{successfully}} synthesized by the ligand exchange method using oxorhenuim gluconate with and an aminothiazole ligand. The complex was characterized using elemental analysis and IR, UV-Vis, NMR and mass spectroscopes. The technetium tracer 99 mTcO-complex {{has also been}} synthesized by two methods using 99 mTc-gluconate as a precursor or; by direct reduction. The radiochemical purity of the complex was over 95 % as measured by thin layer chromatography. In vitro studies showed that the complex possessed good stability under physiological conditions. The partition coefficient indicated that the complex hydrophilic and the electrophoresis {{results showed that the}} complex neutral. Normal biodistributions of the 99 mTc complex exhibit high lung, liver and spleen uptake of 27 %, 11 %, and 12 %, uptake, respectively. Blood and <b>lungs</b> <b>clearance</b> was quite fast (% injection dose in blood and lungs 0. 36 % and 0. 18 %, respectively at 1 hr post-injection), while liver activity remained high for a longer period with 12 % injection dose present at 1 hr post-injection. The radioactivity from the novel technetium complex was excreted mainly through the hepatobiliary system, which passed 35 % of the complex at 1 hr post-injection, and partially through the kidneys...|$|R
