Composite {{materials}} have many advantages such as big specific strength, high specific stiffness, good disrepair safety characteristic, <b>large</b> <b>area</b> <b>molding</b> conveniently {{and easy to}} forming complex shape. It becomes important structural materials of aero aircraft equipment necessarily and is used widely in aviation industry. Composite materials components of aero aircraft with complex and delicate structure chronically work in harsh environment. Early testing of its key component’s minute defects has been an urgent and necessary task. In this paper, its damage model and characteristic are analyzed and studied. Considering the limitation of composite materials structure’s detection methods at present, a number of existing problems are presented and development directions are pointed out. Laser ultrasound detection technique, continuous distribution sensing technique and optical fiber sensing technique are studied. The method of damage detection of aero aircraft’s composite materials components is put forward based on the organic combination of the three techniques. The {{results show that the}} system can be used to detect multi-ultrasound signals of large composite materials structure. Its structure is simple. It has small bulk and low cost.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> <b>mold</b> {{is one of}} the most difficult challenges in the roll to roll nanoimprint field and eliminating the visible seams on a large areamold is evenmore difficult. We present a visually tolerable tiling (VTT) method to make <b>large</b> <b>area</b> micro/nano-patterns without visible seams and their applications. In this study, with small <b>area</b> micro/nano-pattern <b>molds,</b> the VTT method could produce a scaled up mold with the same features as the original mold without any visible seamlines. Also, a fabricated large sizemold was used in the roll to roll imprinting process as a flexible mold.

A dynamic cure kinetics {{model for the}} silicone resin was adopted and cure model and analysis result were validated and compared through a temperature measurement experiment for cylinder geometry with cure model. The temperature deviation between each lens cavity could be reduced by implementing a simulation model on the <b>large</b> <b>area</b> compression <b>mold</b> and by optimizing the location of heat source. A two-step cure cycle was constructed to reduce excessive reaction peak at the initial stage and cycle time. An optimum cure cycle that could reduce cycle time by more than 29 % compared to a one-step cure cycle by adjusting dwell temperature, heating rate, and dwell time was proposed.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow <b>large</b> <b>area</b> processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. <b>Large</b> <b>area</b> <b>mold</b> embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes the potential of advanced <b>large</b> <b>area</b> encapsulation processes for multi chip embedding in combination with <b>large</b> <b>area</b> and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing. PCB based redistribution offers the potential of real <b>large</b> <b>area</b> redistribution up to 610 x 457 mm² and the integration of through mold vias (TMVs) as both are standard features in PCB manufacturing. For the proposed combination of mold embedding and PCB based redistribution two process variations are introduced. The first approach starts with reconfigured wafer/panel assembly, encapsulation and PCB based redistribution with µvias for die interconnection. For the second approach dies are assembled face down on a Cu foil with an adhesive followed by an overmolding/ lamination step. The die interconnect is formed by a photolithography/etching step to open the Cu film at {{the locations of the}} die pads and the pads are connected by metallization afterwards. Process steps as assembly, encapsulation and redistribution on panel size are discussed in detail showing today’s possibilities. Finally, packages developed are introduced demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed technology. In summary this paper describes the potential of <b>large</b> <b>area</b> <b>mold</b> embedding technology in combination with PCB based redistribution processes towards a 3 D SiP stack. The technology described offers a cost effective packaging solution for e. g. future sensor/ASIC systems or processor/memory stacks providing miniaturization and sourcing advantages known from PoP assembly...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{demands and}} the market show two main trends helping to shape the ongoing {{development}} of system integration technologies. First of all is an ongoing {{increase in the number}} of functions directly included in a system - such as electrical, optical, mechanical, biological and chemical processes - combined with the demand for higher reliability and longer system lifetime. Second is the increasingly seamless merging of products and electronics, which necessitates adapting electronics to predefined materials, forms and application environments. Only by these means systems sensors - which are often installed in extremely harsh environments - and signal processing can be implemented near to the point where signals are occurring. <b>Large</b> <b>area</b> <b>mold</b> embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes the potential of heterogeneous integration technologies researched at Fraunhofer IZM with a strong focus on embedding in printed circuit boards and embedding in molded reconfigured wafers with an outlook of advanced <b>large</b> <b>area</b> encapsulation processes for multi chip embedding in combination with <b>large</b> <b>area</b> and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing...|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} designs {{exist for the}} mold, which may be {{selected}} to suit the physical properties of the liquid melt and the solidification process. Molds may exist in top, horizontal or bottom-up pouring and may be fluted or flat walled. The fluted design increases heat transfer owing to a <b>larger</b> contact <b>area.</b> <b>Molds</b> may be either solid [...] "massive" [...] design, sand cast (e.g. for pig iron) or water-cooled shells, depending upon heat transfer requirements. Ingot molds are tapered to prevent the formation of cracks due to uneven cooling. Crack or void formation occurs as the liquid to solid transition has an associated volume change for a constant mass of material. Formation of these ingot defects may render the cast ingot useless, and {{may need to be}} re-melted, recycled or discarded.|$|R
40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow <b>large</b> <b>area</b> processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. <b>Large</b> <b>area</b> <b>mold</b> embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-inPolymer) are two major packaging trends in this <b>area.</b> <b>Mold</b> embedding is currently done on wafer level, typically with diameters of 8 " to 12 ", for future process optimization, PCB technologies offer the potential of real <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> up to 610 × 457 mm 2. For mold embedding as e. g. for fan-out wafer level packaging compression molding equipment is used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet epoxy molding compounds, with the boundary condition, that mold processes do need a product specific tool (with defined diameter & thickness). Within this paper the potential of tool-less lamination processes, a standard in PCB manufacturing, is evaluated. Lamination is done in panel format using well-known molding compounds from wafer level compression molding. To evaluate the potential of today's encapsulants for <b>large</b> <b>area</b> embedding processes, different liquid, granular and sheet molding compounds have been intensively evaluated on their processability, on process & material induced die shift and on resulting warpage - all on panel level. Acting as an interconnection layer, PCB based redistribution technologies using lamination of resin coated copper (RCC) films are used. Within the paper, different RCC materials are introduced and discussed concerning their reliability potential based on the available layer thicknesses and thermo-mechanical material properties. The feasibility of the proposed technologies is demonstrated using a two chip package. Dies are embedded in panel size by lamination technologies. Subsequently the wiring is done by lamination of an RCC film over the embedded cmponents and on the panel backside for double sided redistribution. In a process flow also similar to conventional PCB manufacturing µvias to the die pads and through mold vias are drilled using a UV laser and are metalized by Cu-electroplating in one step. This way dies {{are connected to the}} front copper layer as well as front to backside of the panel. Conductor lines and pads are formed by Cu etching. Finally, a solder mask and a solderable surface finish are applied. If solder depots are necessary, e. g. for BGA packages, those can be applied by solder balling equipment - either by printing or by preform attach. In summary this paper describes the potential to move from wafer level to panel level mold embedding technology in combination with PCB based redistribution processes. The technology described offers a cost effective packaging solution for e. g. single chip packages as well as for future sensor/ASIC systems or processor/memory stacks in volume production...|$|R

This paper describes {{the use of a}} novel S 2 iP (Stacked System in Package) interconnect technique using advanced molding process for multi chip embedding in combination with <b>large</b> <b>area</b> and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing with a focus on integration of through mold vias for package stacking. The use of compression molding equipment with liquid or granular epoxy molding compounds for the targeted integration process flow is a new technology that has been especially developed to allow <b>large</b> <b>area</b> embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically 8 ” to 12 ”. Future developments will deal with panel sizes up to 470 × 370 mm 2. The wiring of the embedded components in this novel type of SiP is done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper (RCC) film is laminated over the embedded components - whichever no matter which shape they are: a compression molded wafer or a <b>larger</b> rectangular <b>area</b> of a <b>Molded</b> Array Package (MAP). Interconnects are formed by laser drilling to die pads and electroplating - all of them making use of standard PCB processes. Thus, through vias which are standard features in PCB manufacturing and can be also integrated in the proposed process flow for mold embedding in combination with RCC based redistribution. Vias were drilled by laser or mechanically after RCC lamination and were metalized together with the vias for chip interconnection. Within this study different liquid and granular moldi- - ng compounds have been intensively evaluated on their processability. Via drilling process by laser and mechanical drilling is systematically developed and analyzed with focus on via diameter, pitch, mold thickness and molding compound composition and here especially on filler particle sizes and distribution. The feasibility of the entire process chain is demonstrated by fabrication of a Ball Grid Array (BGA) type of system package with two embedded dies and through mold vias allowing the stacking of these BGA packages.

The use of compression molding equipment with liquid or granular epoxy molding compounds for the targeted integration process flow is a new technology that has been especially developed to allow <b>large</b> <b>area</b> embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically 8 ? to 12 ?. The wiring of the embedded components in this novel type of SiP can be done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper (RCC) film is laminated over the embedded components. Also thin film redistribution technologies can be applied ? using similar processes as used for WLP on silicon. For the 3 D interconnection two technologies are evaluated: In a process flow similar to conventional PCB manufacturing vias are drilled using a UV laser after RCC lamination and are metalized in the same process as the vias for chip interconnection. A second via generation process uses vertical interconnect elements, e. g. silicon dies with well defined lead structures, assembled in the same process step as the embedded dies. Top and bottom surface of those vertical interconnect elements are exposed after mold embedding. Planar interconnection is then formed by thin film redistribution or after RCC lamination, the vertical interconnect elements are contacted using a µVia process. Within this study the different approaches to vertical interconnection in a mold embedded wafer have been intensively evaluated on their processability. A strong focus was put on the process chain chip placement on a temporary carrier - compression vacuum molding for embedding ? RCC lamination or thin film redistribution ? laser drilling processes for µVias & Thru Holes ? metallization structuring ? module singulation & 3 D assembly. The feasibility of the entire process chain is demonstrated by fabrication of a Ball Grid Array (BGA) type of system package with two embedded dies and through mold vias allowing the stacking of these BGA packages. Reliability of the manufactured 3 D stacks is evaluated by temperature cycling and is analyzed both non-destructively and destructively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} continuum {{simulations of}} viscous polymer flow during nanoimprint lithography (NIL) for embossing tools having irregular spacings and sizes. Simulations varied non-uniform embossing tool geometry to distinguish geometric quantities governing cavity filling order, polymer peak deformation, and global mold filling times. A characteristic NIL velocity predicts cavity filling order. In general, small cavities fill {{more quickly than}} large cavities, while cavity spacing modulates polymer deformation mode. Individual cavity size, not total filling volume, dominates replication time, with large differences in individual cavity size resulting in non-uniform, squeeze flow filling. High density features can be modeled as a solid indenter in squeeze flow to accurately predict polymer flow and allow for optimization of wafer-scale replication.

30|$|Recently, an antireflection (AR) {{property}} {{has been}} a great interest due to the demands for the enhanced performance in electronic devices such as solar cells and displays [1]. Especially, needs for AR property of plastic substrate have been increasing for the rapid growth of flexible electronic fields. Many research groups have already investigated various AR techniques such as single or multi-layer coating, surface texturization, and fabricating the periodic nanostructures [2]. AR nanostructure, so-called moth-eye structure, can efficiently reduce the light reflectance attributed to the gradual change in refractive index between the air and substrate by altering the volume fraction of structures, which in turn reduce Fresnel reflection [3]. There are many techniques available for fabricating AR nanostructure, such as electron beam lithography [4], thermal imprinting [5], hybrid nano-patterning lithography [6], dip pen nanolithography [7] and so on. However, these techniques still require high cost, complex process, and sophisticated equipments. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we employ the nanoimprint lithography (NIL) {{which is one of the}} most potential nano-scale patterning techniques with advantages of rapidness, low cost, and reproducibility. In NIL process, molds or stamps are normally produced using various materials, such as silicon, glass, and metal. However, it is difficult to prepare the periodically uniform nano-sized patterns on <b>large</b> <b>area</b> using <b>molds</b> from these materials. Therefore, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template can be good candidate for mold material due to the advantages of the facile large scale synthesis via electrochemical method and periodical nano-sized patterns with high aspect ratio [8].|$|R
