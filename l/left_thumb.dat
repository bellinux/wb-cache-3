Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, <b>left</b> <b>thumb,</b> left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down with health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his <b>left</b> <b>thumb.</b> Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams was water skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propellor slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> and injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E

40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{originating from}} early childhood; nevertheless, its diagnosis is in older ages. In addition to heredity, environmental factors are also of great {{significance in the}} etiology of the disease. Dermatoglyphic patterns, albeit varied, remain stable for a lifetime and yield {{a large number of}} patterns upon examination. Studies have shown a significant association between dermatoglyphics and some diseases, especially genetic ones. We compared fingerprints between patients with autism and normal individuals in a Fars population living in Khorasan-Razavi Province, Iran, in 2015. The right and left hand fingerprints of 104 autistic individuals (case group; age range= 5 – 15 y) were collected using a fingerprint scanner. The same process was performed for 102 healthy individuals, in the age range of 6 to 25  years. All dermatoglyphic patterns and ridge counts were determined. The data were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney nonparametric test and binomial distribution. There was {{a significant difference in the}} distribution of the dermatoglyphic patterns on the right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> and the index fingers between the case and control groups (P< 0. 05). The patients had a significantly higher count of loops on their right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> and their index fingers. A significant decrease in ridge counts for the right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> and the index fingers was observed in the patients compared to the controls. The results suggested that the patterns were associated with the risk of autism. The patterns may be drawn upon as biometric parameters in the screening of children with autism...|$|R

40|$|Background. Evolutionary forces such as {{founder effect}} {{resulted}} in reproductive isolation and reduced genetic diversity {{may have led}} to ethnic variation in the facial appearance and other features like fingerprints pattern. Aim. To determine the pattern of facial proportion based on neoclassical facial canon. The associations between facial proportions and thumbprint patterns were also investigated. Subject and Methods. A total of 534 subjects of 18 – 25 years of age participated. Direct sensing and photographs methods were used to determine fingerprint and facial features, respectively. Fisher’s Exact test was used to test for association between variables. Results. It was observed that in both males and females there was no (0 %) occurrence of classical canon of facial proportion. There was also no association between sex and facial proportions. A significant association was found in between thumbprint patterns and vertical class III neoclassical facial proportion only when the frequency of both left and right thumbprint patterns was considered a single entity. There is no significant association between the thumbprint patterns of the right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> with vertical horizontal facial proportions in male and female participants. It was observed that right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> have more tendency of significance with facial proportion in males and females, respectively. Conclusion. Fingerprint pattern and its associated features may be controlled by a different mechanism such that the two may correlate differently with other features {{as the case may be}} with facial features...|$|R
25|$|The <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> alone {{operates}} nine keys: B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys {{when combined}} create A4, and the whisper key. The whisper key {{should be held}} down for notes between and including F1 and G2 and certain other notes. Additional notes can be created with the <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> keys. The D1 and bottom key above the whisper key on the tenor joint (C key) together create both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B4 is created. The whisper key may also be used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of balalaika technique {{is the use of}} the <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form chords. Traditionally, the side of the index finger of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a plectrum is used on the larger sizes.|$|E
25|$|While {{flicking}} is used {{to higher}} notes, the whisper key is used for lower notes. From the A right below middle C and lower, the whisper key is pressed with the <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> and held {{for the duration of}} the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using the whisper key is especially important to ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of complete tears of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint depends on demonstration of excessive laxity of the ligament, {{but there is}} controversy on whether laxity greater than a certain cut-off value or laxity greater than the opposite thumb is the criterion for diagnosis. We examined 200 thumbs of 100 normal individuals in extension and in 30 of flexion. In 34 % of subjects {{there was a difference}} of 10 or more between right and <b>left</b> <b>thumbs</b> in extension, and 12 % had a difference of at least 15. In flexion, 22 % of thumbs differed by 10 or more and 3 % by 15 or more. Comparison with the uninjured contralateral thumb is unreliable in many individuals. We recommend the lack of a definite end point on stress examination as indicating complete rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament...|$|R

25|$|In the {{instance}} just cited, {{using the}} handedness convention {{used in many}} optics textbooks, the light is considered left-handed/counter-clockwise circularly polarized. Referring to the accompanying animation, it is considered left-handed because if one points one's <b>left</b> <b>thumb</b> against the direction of travel, ones fingers curl in the direction the electric field rotates as the wave passes a given point in space. The helix also forms a left-handed helix in space. Similarly this light is considered counter-clockwise circularly polarized because if a stationary observer faces against the direction of travel, the person will observe its electric field rotate in the counter-clockwise direction as the wave passes a given point in space.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{position}} for the left hand {{is much the same}} as that of the right, except upside down. Unlike many players of steel-string and electric guitars, which have a narrower neck and fingerboard, classical guitarists do not place their <b>left</b> hand <b>thumbs</b> over the top of the neck. Instead, they place them behind the neck, usually behind the second finger.|$|R
25|$|An {{aspect of}} bassoon {{technique}} not found {{on any other}} woodwind is called flicking. It involves the <b>left</b> hand <b>thumb</b> momentarily pressing, or 'flicking' the high A, C and D keys {{at the beginning of}} certain notes in the middle octave to achieve a clean slur from a lower note. This eliminates cracking, or brief multiphonics that happens without the use of this technique.|$|R
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{response is}} called universal composition (UC). UC says that {{so long as}} the Xs do not spatially overlap, the Xs can compose a complex object. Universal compositionalists are also considered those who support unrestricted composition. More formally: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is a Y such that Y is composed of the Xs. For example, someone's <b>left</b> <b>thumb,</b> the top half of another person's right shoe, and a quark in the center of their galaxy can compose a complex object according to universal composition. Likewise, this theory also has some issues, most of them dealing with our experiences that these randomly chosen parts make up a complex whole and there are far too many objects posited in our ontology.|$|E

On the third day, the Black Caps required only 25 more overs to dismiss Bangladesh for an innings win. Only Shakib Al Hasan offered any resistance, finishing on an unbeaten 41. Equally telling was that Bangladesh's highest-scoring partnership in their second innings was 30 on the last wicket.|$|E

60|$|In {{my earlier}} trials some three years ago, {{an attempt at}} {{classification}} was made upon that same principle, when the experience gained was instructive. It had seemed best to limit them to the prints of a single digit, and the thumb was selected. I collected enough specimens to fill fourteen sheets, containing in the aggregate 504 prints of right thumbs, arranged in six lines and six columns (6 × 6 × 14 = 504), and another set of fourteen sheets containing the corresponding <b>left</b> <b>thumbs.</b> Then, for the greater convenience of study these sheets were photographed, and enlargements upon paper to {{about two and a}} half times the natural size made from the negatives. The enlargements of the right thumb prints were reversed, in order to make them comparable on equal terms with those of the left. The sheets were then cut up into rectangles about the size of small playing-cards, each of which contained a single print, and the register number in my catalogue was entered on its back, together with the letters L. for left, or R.R. for reversed right, as the case might be.|$|R
