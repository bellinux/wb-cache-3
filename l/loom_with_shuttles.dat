50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial looms originally very closely mimicked handweaving looms, modern industrial looms are very different. A <b>loom</b> <b>with</b> a <b>shuttle,</b> such as most hand weaving looms, will produce a very different selvage from a loom without a shuttle, {{like some of the}} modern industrial looms. Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.|$|R
5000|$|... "Kissing the shuttle" [...] is {{the term}} for a process by which weavers used their mouths to pull thread through {{the eye of a}} shuttle when the pirn was replaced. The same {{shuttles}} were used by many weavers, and the practice was unpopular. It was outlawed in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1911 but continued even after it had been outlawed in Lancashire, England in 1952. The Lancashire cotton industry was loath to invest in hand-threaded shuttles, or in the more productive Northrop automatic <b>looms</b> <b>with</b> self-threading <b>shuttles,</b> which were introduced in 1902.|$|R
50|$|In 1792, Dr Cartwright {{obtained}} {{his last}} patent for weaving machinery; this provided his <b>loom</b> <b>with</b> multiple <b>shuttle</b> boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes.However all his efforts were unavailing; {{it became apparent}} that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the beam warper, and the dressing sizing machine.|$|R

50|$|Calypso {{is remembered}} the most {{for her role}} in Homer's Odyssey, in which she {{attempts}} to keep the fabled Greek hero Odysseus on her island to make him her immortal husband. According to Homer, Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner at Ogygia for seven years, while Apollodorus says five years and Hyginus says one. Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and from, weaving on her <b>loom</b> <b>with</b> a golden <b>shuttle.</b> During this time they have sex together, although Odysseus soon comes to wish for circumstances to change.|$|R
500|$|This myth {{tells of}} Arachne, the {{daughter}} of a famous Tyrian purple wool dyer in Hypaepa of Lydia. Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving. Eventually, she began to consider herself to be a greater weaver than the goddess Athena herself, and challenged the goddess to a weaving contest to prove her superior skill. Athena wove the scene of her victory over Poseidon that had earned her the patronage of Athens, while Arachne wove a tapestry featuring many episodes of infidelity among the Gods of Olympus, which angered Athena. The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride. In a final moment of anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and <b>loom</b> <b>with</b> her <b>shuttle</b> and cursed Arachne to live with extreme guilt. Out of sadness, Arachne soon hanged herself. Taking pity on her, Athena brought her back to life transformed as a spider, using the poison aconite; [...] "—and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web." ...|$|R
50|$|In pre-Dynastic Egypt, nt (Neith) {{was already}} {{the goddess of}} weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She {{protected}} the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she {{was known as the}} most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the <b>loom's</b> <b>shuttle,</b> <b>with</b> its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head. According to E. A. Wallis Budge (The Gods of the Egyptians) the root of the word for weaving and also for being are the same: nnt.|$|R

50|$|The {{thread that}} is woven through the warp {{is called the}} weft. The weft is {{threaded}} through the warp using a shuttle. The original hand-loom was limited in width by the weaver's reach, {{because of the need}} to throw the shuttle from hand to hand. The invention of the flying <b>shuttle</b> <b>with</b> its fly cord and picking sticks enabled the weaver to pass the shuttle from a box at either side of the <b>loom</b> <b>with</b> one hand, and across a greater width. The invention of the drop box allowed a weaver to use multiple shuttles to carry different wefts.|$|R
50|$|The inkle <b>loom</b> is {{threaded}} <b>with</b> warp threads {{according to the}} weaver's design, alternating between yarn that can be raised and lowered and yarn that is secured in place {{through the use of}} the heddles. The raising and lowering of these warp threads creates the shed through which the weft thread will be carried on a shuttle. The weaver should make one pass <b>with</b> the <b>shuttle</b> <b>with</b> each opening of a shed through the raising and lowering of threads.|$|R
