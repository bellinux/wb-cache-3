500|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2008/2009 season {{by winning the}} Northern Ireland Trophy, {{defeating}} Dave Harold 9–3 in the final. O'Sullivan is the only player to win back-to-back ranking events {{in the last four}} years. He then reached the final of the Shanghai Masters, having defeated Stephen Maguire in the semi–finals with two the top breaks of 141 and 145. However, in the final, he was defeated 10–8 by qualifier Ricky Walden. O'Sullivan was leading, but Walden pulled back four frames in a row to win the match. In the Premier League, he secured a 7–2 win over Mark Selby, which meant that he had won the event eight times in total, and five times consecutively. However, O'Sullivan failed to defend his UK Championship title, losing to Joe Perry 5–9 in the second round. O'Sullivan had conceded the twelfth game of the match to go 5–7 down, although Perry held a lead of only 23 points to zero. Commenting afterwards, O'Sullivan said [...] "It might have <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> lost my head or whatever, but I'm sure I'll bounce back." [...] For this he was later fined £300, and was ordered to pay £1,000 in costs.|$|E
2500|$|He did {{paint the}} old {{character}} mustache over his real {{one on a}} few rare performing occasions, including a TV sketch with Jackie Gleason on the latter's variety show in the 1960s (in which they performed {{a variation on the}} song [...] "Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean," [...] co-written by Marx's uncle Al Shean) and the 1968 Otto Preminger film Skidoo. In his late 70s at the time, Marx remarked on his appearance: [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was embalmed." [...] He played a mob boss called [...] "God" [...] and, according to Marx, [...] "both my performance and the film were God-awful!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He was re-elected {{eight times}} from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was {{numbered}} the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993 and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, {{as a result}} of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with veteran Brooklyn congressman Steve Solarz, although the matchup did not actually materialize. In preparation, Schumer [...] "set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had a very difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the Associated Press." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, in his Spectator blog {{he wrote}} about Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour Party, in unflattering terms. Liddle began the article by asking: [...] "So — Harriet Harman, then. Would you? I mean after a few beers obviously, not while you were sober." [...] Tanya Gold {{asserted}} in The Guardian that Liddle had delivered a [...] "tissue-thin polemic." [...] Pointing {{out that it was}} The Spectators cover story that week, Gold wondered if, after 100 years of striving to improve women's rights, whether [...] "we're back in the schoolyard – or is it the brothel?" [...] Rachel Cooke in The Observer nearly two months later recalled finding Liddle's piece [...] "so disgusting I flushed violently all the way from my breastbone to my forehead when I first read it. I <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had German measles." ...|$|E
2500|$|For nearly 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton {{have been}} {{involved}} in an ongoing feud. Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and The Red Hot Chili Peppers prior to the feud had toured together in support of their 1987 funk metal albums The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Introduce Yourself. However things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit [...] "Epic" [...] (from 1989's follow up to Introduce Yourself, The Real Thing). Kiedis stated “I watched [...] “Epic” video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was looking in a mirror. I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'". The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album California on June 8, 1999 but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back a week so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Mr. Bungle claimed that Kiedis had them removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe claiming that as the headlining act at the festivals, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear.|$|E

He said {{he was just trying}} to show how stupid the municipal severance plan was and he claimed that he was just going to donate the money to charity. He said, [...] "My rationale for filing was to prove what a fraud this thing is. Now it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> am a greedy bastard. Every one of those suckers are getting it.

60|$|The bath {{was a great}} comfort. For I {{began to}} be {{sensible}} of acute pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together. When I had bathed, they (I mean my aunt and Janet) enrobed me in a shirt {{and a pair of}} trousers belonging to Mr. Dick, and tied me up in two or three great shawls. What sort of bundle I <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> don't know, but I felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep.|$|E

6000|$|While I {{was in the}} Klondike {{my father}} died, and {{the burden of the}} family fell on my shoulders. Times were bad in California, and I could get no work. While trying for it I wrote [...] "Down the River," [...] which was rejected. During the wait for this {{rejection}} I wrote a twenty-thousand word serial for a news company, which was also rejected. Pending each rejection I still kept on writing fresh stuff. I did not know what an editor <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> did not know a soul who had ever published anything. Finally a story was accepted by a Californian magazine, for which I received five dollars. Soon afterwards [...] "The Black Cat" [...] offered me forty dollars for a story.|$|E

I was a stranger; I knew no one in Europe; I hadn't a penny in my pocket; I couldn't even send a telegram to London to get my lost letter replaced; my hotel bill was a week old, and the presentation of it imminent--so imminent that it could happen at any moment now. I was so frightened that my wits seemed to leave me. I tramped and tramped, back and forth, like a crazy person. If anybody approached me I hurried away, for no matter what a person <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> took him for the head waiter with the bill.|$|E
60|$|Out {{there in}} the midst of such a {{succession}} of big smoky ones, a third man was added to our party, one Freeth. Shaking the water from my eyes as I emerged from one wave and peered ahead to see what the next one <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> saw him tearing in on the back of it, standing upright on his board, carelessly poised, a young god bronzed with sunburn. We went through the wave on the back of which he rode. Ford called to him. He turned an airspring from his wave, rescued his board from its maw, paddled over to us and joined Ford in showing me things. One thing in particular I learned from Freeth, namely, how to encounter the occasional breaker of exceptional size that rolled in. Such breakers were really ferocious, and it was unsafe to meet them on top of the board. But Freeth showed me, so that whenever I saw one of that calibre rolling down on me, I slid off the rear end of the board and dropped down beneath the surface, my arms over my head and holding the board. Thus, if the wave ripped the board out of my hands and tried to strike me with it (a common trick of such waves), there would be a cushion of water a foot or more in depth, between my head and the blow. When the wave passed, I climbed upon the board and paddled on. Many men have been terribly injured, I learn, by being struck by their boards.|$|E
