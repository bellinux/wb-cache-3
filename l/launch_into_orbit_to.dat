50|$|STRV 1A and STRV 1B are cube-shaped micro-satellites {{each with}} a mass of 50 kg. They were <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> test new solar cells and measure static charge on its surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Simply {{referred}} to as the Commandos, they soon demonstrated their skills by blowing up dams across the country, debuting their combining abilities against Rail Racer and later attempting to harness the energies of a volcano on Montrose Island. As part of a string of failed attempts to locate the Autobots' hidden base, Movor was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> track Side Burn from space, and the Decepticons then pretended to have reverted to their original Autobot selves {{in an effort to make}} the Autobots take them in. Later, Decepticon corruption of the Autobots' global spacebridge led Ruination into conflict with Landfill.|$|R
2500|$|Brown {{proposed}} {{the establishment of}} a state space academy and the purchasing of a satellite that would be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> provide emergency communications for the stateâ€”a proposal similar to one that was indeed eventually adopted. In 1979, an out-of-state columnist, Mike Royko, at the Chicago Sun-Times, picked up on the nickname from Brown's girlfriend at the time, Linda Ronstadt, who was quoted in a 1978 Rolling Stone magazine interview humorously calling him [...] "Moonbeam". A year later Royko expressed his regret for publicizing the nickname, and in 1991 Royko disavowed it entirely, proclaiming Brown to be just as serious as any other politician.|$|R

5000|$|The IS {{system was}} [...] "co-orbital", {{approaching}} its target {{over time and}} then exploding a shrapnel warhead close enough to kill it. The missile was launched when a target satellite's ground track rises above the launch site. Once the satellite is detected, the missile is <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> close <b>to</b> the targeted satellite. It takes 90 to 200 minutes (or one <b>to</b> two <b>orbits)</b> for the missile interceptor to {{get close enough to}} its target. The missile is guided by an onboard radar. The interceptor, which weighs 1400 kg, may be effective up to one kilometer from a target.|$|R
40|$|On February 14, 1980, {{the solar}} maximum mission (SMM) {{satellite}} was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> with experiments <b>to</b> monitor solar activity. In {{order to obtain}} common object observations, experiments must be coaligned within 90 arc-seconds of the spacecraft pointing vector. Hardware designed to minimize structural and thermal distortions of the experiment support plate is described. Coalignment was provided through control of interface which combined flexible blades to limit load transfer and spherical seats for alignment reference...|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{the first}} Intelsat {{satellite}} was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit.</b> From 1970 <b>to</b> 1971, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) of Britain began {{to operate a}} secret signal station at Morwenstow, near Bude in Cornwall, England. The station intercepted satellite communications over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Soon afterwards, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) built a second signal station at Yakima, near Seattle, for the interception of satellite communications over the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2001, the Canadarm2 was <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> and {{attached}} <b>to</b> the International Space Station. The Canadarm2 is a larger, more capable {{version of the}} arm used by the Space Shuttle, and is hailed as [...] "smarter". Also in April, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Global Hawk made the first autonomous non-stop flight over the Pacific Ocean from Edwards Air Force Base in California to RAAF Base Edinburgh in Southern Australia. The flight was made in 22 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Schilt {{was noted}} at Columbia for walking into his classes {{the first day}} after the launch of Sputnik 1 and commenting [...] "Well, gentlemen, it is not every day we have {{something}} new in the sky to talk about", following which he devoted the entire class to proving that Sputnik had been deliberately <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> an <b>orbit</b> designed <b>to</b> make it invisible from the United States {{for as long as}} possible (six weeks).|$|R
40|$|The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), an Explorer class {{ultraviolet}} astronomy mission, {{is an international}} cooperative program between the United States, the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Space Agency (ESA) which provides for a single <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> conduct spectral distribution studies of celestial and solar system ultraviolet sources. The spacecraft and scientific instruments were designed and fabricated at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The spectrograph camera {{was provided by the}} UK; ESA provided the solar array as well as the European ground station. The IUE observatory system was designed to functionally resemble a ground-based optical observatory at which guest observers could execute observing programs in real time. Observatory performance substantially exceeded design and mission objectives. The secondary mission objectives were also met...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} set {{at the dawn of}} space exploration, where a {{military}} experiment led by Dr. Groszinger, who supervises the launch of the first human being into space, Major Allen Rice. Rice is <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around Earth <b>to</b> observe weather conditions over enemy territories, but Rice soon starts receiving messages from dead people, whose spirits inhabit the atmosphere. Thinking Rice has lost his mind, the military calls off the project, and Dr. Groszinger himself is forced to deny that they sent a man into space.|$|R
50|$|H-IIA (H2A) is {{an active}} {{expendable}} launch system operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The liquid-fueled H-IIA rockets have been used <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> satellites <b>into</b> geostationary <b>orbit,</b> <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> a lunar <b>orbiting</b> spacecraft, and <b>to</b> launch an interplanetary space probe to Venus. Launches occur at the Tanegashima Space Center. The H-IIA first flew in 2001. , H-IIA rockets were launched 35 times, including 29 consecutive missions without a failure, dating back to November 29, 2003.|$|R
2500|$|Like Apollo, Constellation {{would have}} flown a lunar orbit {{rendezvous}} mission profile, but unlike Apollo, Constellation would have also employed Earth orbit rendezvous, conveying {{the crew to}} the vehicle. The lander, known as Altair, would have been launched separately on the Ares V rocket, a rocket based on both Space Shuttle and Apollo technologies. Orion would have been launched separately and would have linked up with Altair in low Earth orbit. Also, unlike Apollo, Orion would have remained unmanned in lunar orbit while the entire crew landed on the lunar surface. Toward {{the end of the}} mission, the Altair spacecraft would have <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> link up with the Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit rendezvous. [...] Like Apollo, the Orion capsule would then have returned <b>to</b> Earth <b>orbit,</b> re-entered the atmosphere and landed in water.|$|R
40|$|The Moon {{is a body}} rich {{in natural}} {{resources}} and full of intriguing scientific questions, and it will most certainly {{play a central role}} in the growth of near-Earth and deep space ventures of the twenty-first century. The LOP mission is an example of one way to catalog the Moon's natural resources and to answer lunar science questions in parallel. In a realistic planetary exploration program, this mission must compete with other interesting planetary missions and therefore the LOP must be as low cost and adaptable as possible. This flexibility is reflected in the LOP's heavy design emphasis on modularity. The LOP mission can easily be expanded to include new technologies, and additional orbiters could be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> lunar <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> provide a constellation of remote-sensing platforms. This design thus projects a broad range of possibilities for continued lunar exploration in the next century...|$|R
40|$|A half {{a century}} ago, the launch of Sputnik- 1 saw the start of an era where we began <b>to</b> <b>launch</b> {{artificial}} satellites <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> {{tell us what we}} look like from above. Hundreds of Earth-observing satellites have followed, and this extensive remote sensing has provided both iconic views and unprecedented insights into our planet. Tatem, Goetz and Hay review the development of these satellites over the past 50 years, as well as the data they have produced, which has lead to a greater understanding of Earth's terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric processes. They examine current trends and speculate on what the next 50 years of satellite remote sensing may brin...|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{to shore}} up support for the program, Fletcher {{directed}} NASA to develop the shuttle {{to be able to}} support the Air Force's requirements as well, as initially developed in their [...] "Class III" [...] fully reusable vehicles. If the shuttle became vital to the Air Force as well as NASA, it would be effectively unkillable. The Air Force's requirements were based about a projected series of large spy satellites then under development, which were 60 feet long and weighed 40,000 lbs. They needed <b>to</b> be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> polar <b>orbits,</b> corresponding <b>to</b> a normal launch from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) of 65,000 lbs (launches to the east receive a free boost from the Earth's natural rotation).|$|R
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been <b>launched</b> directly <b>into</b> an <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> rendezvous with the Pegasus, or <b>into</b> a lower <b>orbit,</b> subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that <b>to</b> raise its <b>orbit.</b> The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids â€” supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of satellites {{is thought to}} be a natural by-product of planet formation in our Solar System, and thus, moons of extrasolar planets (exomoons) may be abundant in extrasolar planetary systems, as well. Exomoons have yet to be discovered. However, moons larger than 0. 1 Earth masses can be detected and characterized using current transit techniques. Here, we show that collisions between rocky planets with masses between a quarter to ten Earth masses can create impact-generated debris disks that could accrete into moons. Collisions between like-sized objects, at oblique impact angles, and velocities near escape speed create disks massive enough to form satellites that are dynamically stable against planetary tides. Impacts of this type onto a superearth between 2 to 7 Earth masses can <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> enough mass <b>to</b> create a satellite large enough to be detected in Kepler transit data. Impact velocity is a crucial controlling factor on disk mass, which has been overlooked in all prior studies of moon formation via planetary collision. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{organisms that}} make us ill, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, are like attacking armies. We now {{know a great deal}} more about this unseen world of {{microscopic}} invaders. Fortunately for us, the human immune system is ever vigilant against them. Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi occupy almost every corner of the Earth, and even parts of the human body. Some organisms are beneficial to us, helping to produce milk, cheese or yogurt. Others are potentially harmful, yet we don#t always develop illnesses from them; they are kept in check by the sentinels of our immune system. Our immune system is routinely challenged by these organisms every day. When the immune response is diminished, our ability to fight off these "bugs" is lowered. And that's when we become ill. Space flight presents a challenge to the immune system. Scientists believe that the stressful conditions of space flight - <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit,</b> adapting <b>to</b> microgravity, heavy workloads, and isolation from family and friends, to name but a few - reduce the astronauts' immunity. This immune suppression makes them more susceptible to common illnesses from bacteria and to re-infections from latent viruses in the body. In addition, risk of spreading illness in the confined environment of the Space Shuttle is high. Understanding changes in immune function will help scientists develop ways to keep astronauts healthy in space. This knowledge can also benefit earthbound populations. This experiment will give scientists insight into the immune system by comparing how certain cells of astronauts' innate immune system - {{the first line of defense}} against invaders - function after flight compared to before flight...|$|R
40|$|The Cryogenic On-Orbit Liquid Depot - Storage, Acquisition and Transfer (COLD-SAT) {{spacecraft}} will be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> low earth <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> perform fluid management {{experiments on}} the behavior of subcritical liquid hydrogen (LH 2). For determining the optimum on-orbit attitude for the COLD-SAT satellite, a comparative analytical study was performed to determine the thermal impacts of spacecraft attitude on the performance of the COLD-SAT non-vacuum jacketed LH 2 supply tank. Tank thermal performance was quantified by total conductive and radiative heat leakage into the pressure vessel due to the absorbed solar, earth albedo and infra-red on-orbit fluxes, and also by the uniformity of the variation of this leakage on the vessel surface area. Geometric and thermal analysis math models were developed for the spacecraft and the tank as part of this analysis, based on their individual thermal/structural designs. Two quasi-inertial spacecraft attitudes were investigated and their effects on the tank performance compared. The results are one of the criteria by which the spacecraft orientation in orbit was selected for the in-house NASA Lewis Research Center design...|$|R
5000|$|The {{degree of}} orbital {{shadowing}} {{an object in}} LEO experiences is determined by that object's beta angle. An object <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> an initial <b>orbit</b> with an inclination equal to the complement of the Earth's inclination to the ecliptic results in an initial beta angle of 0 degrees ( [...] = 0Â°) for the orbiting object. This allows the object to spend the maximum possible amount of its orbital period in the Earth's shadow, and results in extremely reduced absorption of solar energy. At a LEO of 280 kilometers, the object is in sunlight through 59% of its orbit (approximately 53 minutes in Sunlight, and 37 minutes in shadow.) On the other extreme, an object <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> an <b>orbit</b> parallel <b>to</b> the terminator results in a beta angle of 90 degrees ( [...] = 90Â°), and the object is in sunlight 100% of the time. An example would be a polar orbit initiated at local dawn or dusk on an equinox. Beta angle can be controlled to keep a satellite as cool as possible (for instruments that require low temperatures, such as infrared cameras) by keeping the beta angle as close to zero as possible, or, conversely, to keep a satellite in sunlight {{as much as possible}} (for conversion of sunlight by its solar panels, for solar stability of sensors, or to study the Sun) by maintaining a beta angle as close to +90 or -90 as possible.|$|R
40|$|For decades, clever {{people in}} and around the space {{industry}} have been dreaming up ways of using space for commercial or scientific gain. However, in many cases the ideas, though valid, were not economically or technologically feasible. Arthur C. Clarke dreamt up the concept for geostationary satellites long before there was even a means to get satellites into space, and many more ideas have came and went in the period in between never to manifest themselves as real missions. This paper will explore proposed mission concepts that were before their time and will assess their relevance to todayâ€™s technology and capability. In addition, it will assess the suitability of todayâ€™s technology to enable old problems to be solved. In particular, the paper will use the CubeSat platform {{as an example of a}} very low-cost means of <b>launching</b> multiple spacecraft <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> meet specific application needs. The paper will also assess the use of todayâ€™s small satellite technology to service the gap in the long existing need for data for the purposes of science, communication and prediction/warning of natural disasters. Finally, conclusions will be drawn as to the impact that small and miniature spacecraft can have on the future commercial, science and data driven space mission of the next 10 years and what the author considers to be the most relevant barriers and opportunities to the growth of small satellite success in these areas...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). LAGEOS- 1 is a dense spherical {{satellite}} whose tracking accuracy is such as to yield a medium-term inertial reference frame and that is used {{as an adjunct to}} more difficult and more data-intensive absolute frame measurements. LAGEOS- 3, an identical satellite <b>to</b> be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> an <b>orbit</b> complementary <b>to</b> that of LAGEOS- 1, would experience an equal and opposite classical precession to that of LAGEOS- 1. Besides providing a more accurate real-time measurement of the earth`s length of day and polar wobble, this paired-satellite system would provide the first direct measurement of the general relativistic frame-dragging effect. Of the five dominant error sources in this experiment, the largest one involves surface forces on the satellite and their consequent impact on the orbital nodal precession. The surface forces are a function of the spin dynamics of the satellite. We have modeled the spin dynamics of a LAGEOS-type satellite and used this spin model to estimate the impact of the thermal rocketing effect on the LAGEOS- 3 experiment. We have also performed an analytic tensor expansion of Synge`s world function to better reveal the nature of the predicted frame-dragging effect. We showed that this effect is not due to the Riemann curvature tensor, but rather is a ``potential effect`` arising from the acceleration of the world lines in the Kerr spacetime geometry...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the space age, the main actors in space exploration have been governmental agencies, enabling a privileged access to space, but with very restricted and rare missions. The last decade has seen the rise of space tourism, and the founding of ambitious private space mining companies, showing {{the beginning}}s of a new exploration era, that is based on a more generalized and regular access to space and which {{is not limited to the}} Earth's vicinity. However, the cost of <b>launching</b> sufficient mass <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>to</b> sustain these inspiring challenges is prohibitive, and the necessary infrastructures to support these missions is still lacking. To provide easy and affordable access into orbital and deep space destinations, there is the need to create a network of spaceports via specific waypoint locations coupled with the use of natural resources, or In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), to provide a more economical solution. As part of the International Space University Space Studies Program 2012, the international and intercultural team of Operations and Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS) proposes an interdisciplinary answer to the problem of economical space access and transportation. This paper presents a summary of a detailed report [1] of the different phases of a project for developing a network of spaceports throughout the Solar System in a timeframe of 50 years. The requirements, functions, critical technologies and mission architecture of this network of spaceports are outlined in a roadmap of the important steps and phases. The economic and financial aspects are emphasized in order to allow a sustainable development of the network in a public-private partnership via the formation of an International Spaceport Authority (ISPA). The approach includes engineering, scientific, financial, legal, policy, and societal aspects. Team OASIS intends to provide guidelines to make the development of space transportation via a spaceports logistics network feasible, and believes that this pioneering effort will revolutionize space exploration, science and commerce, ultimately contributing to permanently expand humanity into space...|$|R
