40|$|Structure and {{dynamics}} {{lie at the}} heart of the materials science. A detailed knowledge of both subjects would be foundational in understanding the materials' properties and predicting their potential applications. However, the task becomes increasingly difficult as the particle size is reduced to the nanometer scale. For nanostructured materials their laboratory x-ray scattering patterns are overlapped and broadened, making structure determination impossible. Atomic pair distribution function technique based on either synchrotron x-ray or neutron scattering data is known as the tool of choice for probing local structures. However, to solve the problem" in low-dimensional materials with PDF is still challenging. For example for 2 D materials of interest in this thesis the crystallographic modeling approach often yields unphysical thermal factors along stacking direction where new chemical intuitions about their actual structures and new modeling methodology/program are needed. Beyond this, lattice dynamical investigations on nanosized particles are extremely dicult. Laboratory tools such as Raman and infra-red only probe phonons at Brillouin zone center. Although in literature there are a great number of theoretical studies of their vibrational properties based on either empirical force elds or density functional theory, various approximations made in theories make the theoretical predictions less reliable. Also, there lacks the direct experiment result to validate the theory against. In this thesis, we studied the structure {{and dynamics}} of a wide variety of technologically relevant low-dimensional materials through synchrotron based x-ray PDF and high energy resolution inelastic x-ray scattering (HERIX) techniques. By collecting PDF data and employing advanced modeling program such as DiPy-CMI, we successfully determined the atomic structures of (i) emerging Ti 3 C 2, Nb 4 C 3 MXenes (transition metal carbides and/or nitrides) that are promising for energy storage applications, and of (ii) zirconium phenylphosphonate ion exchange materials that are proposed to separate lanthanide ions from actinide ions in nuclear waste. Both material systems have two-dimensional layered nanocrystalline structure where we observed that the stacking of layers are not in good registry, also known as "turbostratic" disorder. Consequently the signals from a single layer of atoms dominate the experimental PDFthus building up a single slab model and simulating PDF using Debye function analysis was sucient to capture the main structural features in the measured PDF data. The information on correlation <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>layers</b> along the stacking direction, however, is contained in low-Q diraction peaks in either laboratory x-ray or synchrotron x-ray scattering patterns. On the lattice dynamics side, we first investigated the trend of atomic bonding strength in size dependent platinum nanoparticles based on temperature dependent PDF data and measured Debye temperatures. An anomalous bond softening was observed at a particle size less than 2 nm. Since Debye model gives a simple quadratic phonon density of states (PDOS) curve, which is a simplified version of real lattice dynamics, we are motivated to measure full PDOS curves on three CdSe nanoclusters by using non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering technique. We observed an overall blue-shift of PDOS curves with decreased sizes. Our current exemplary studies will open the door to a large number of future structural and lattice dynamical studies on a much broader range of low-dimensional material systems...|$|E

40|$|Using a rat {{epidural}} bead implantation model, {{we found}} that compression alone could reduce the overall and individual <b>layer</b> thicknesses <b>of</b> cerebral cortex with no apparent cell death. The den-dritic lengths and spine densities <b>of</b> <b>layer</b> II/III and V pyramidal neurons started to decrease within 3 days of compression. Decompression for 14 days resulted in near complete to partial recovery of the cortical thickness and <b>of</b> the dendritic <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>layer</b> II/III and V pyramidal neurons, depending on {{the duration of the}} preceding compression. The recoverability was better following short (3 -day) than long (1 - or 3 -month) periods of compression. The loss of dendritic spines nevertheless persisted. An intraventricular infusion of NGF was performed after decompressing the lesions following 3 days of cortical compression, and this increased the recovery of the spines but not the dendritic <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the cortical pyramidal neurons, nor did it alter the recovery of the cortical thickness. NGF also promoted the increase of the dendritic spines, but not the dendritic <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the cortical pyrami-dal neurons of normal animals.

The flow of particles in such geometries is confined to a shallow layer at the free surface. The <b>length</b> and thickness <b>of</b> the <b>layer</b> shrink and expand periodically with rotation of the cylinder, resulting in chaotic advection and improved mixing of passive tracers. Experimental results obtained by flow visualization are reported for quasi-two-dimensional mixers half filled with glass beads. A depth-averaged flow model to predict the time-varying layer thickness profile is presented, along with a perturbation solution in terms of a small parameter k, which is the ratio <b>of</b> the maximum <b>layer</b> thickness to the half <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>layer</b> (L), at the cross-section orientation when the length is minimum.

The measured layer thickness profiles averaged over different orientations of noncircular mixers match reasonably well with the theory, but the standard deviations are larger for the noncircular cylinders compared to the circle. The O(k) perturbation solution and the full theory both predict that the scaled layer thickness varies periodically; the deviations are proportional to the rate of change <b>of</b> the <b>length</b> with orientation.
