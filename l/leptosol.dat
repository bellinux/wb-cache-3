50|$|A <b>Leptosol</b> in the FAO World Reference Base for Soil Resources {{is a very}} {{shallow soil}} over hard rock or highly {{calcareous}} material or a deeper soil that is extremely gravelly and/or stony. Leptosols cover approximately 1.7 billion hectares of the Earth's surface. They are found from the tropics to the cold polar regions and from sea level to the highest peaks. Leptosols are particularly widespread in mountain areas, notably in Asia, South America, northern Canada and Alaska; and in the Saharan and Arabian deserts. Elsewhere, Leptosols {{can be found on}} hard rocks or where erosion has kept pace with soil formation or removed the top of the soil. In the FAO soil classification for the UNESCO Soil Map of the World (1974) the Leptosols on calcareous rock were called Rendzinas, those on acid rock were Rankers. The very shallow, less than 10 cm deep, Lithic Leptosols in mountain regions are the most extensive Leptosols on Earth.|$|E

Austrian pine forests in this region are an important and ecologically valuable community. The complexity of the geological structure and relief dynamics are dominant environmental factors that condition the expressed variability of soils in the study area. Forest communities of Austrian pine are formed on the peridotites and serpentinites, eutric ranker (haplic <b>leptosol),</b> eutric cambisol (haplic cambisols) and pseudogley (haplic planosol), dense granular and marl limestones calcomelanosol (mollic <b>leptosol),</b> rendzina (rendzic <b>leptosol)</b> and calcocambisol (leptic cambisol). The productivity of these soils is highly correlated with depth and texture composition, and the impact of these factors is linked with soil type, climate and other site conditions.

40|$|International audienceOrganic matter (OM) {{sources and}} {{transfers}} are critical {{questions at the}} crossroad of ecology, hydrologyand paleoenvironmental studies in karst environments. Recently chemical or isotopic characterisationsof these organic matters have demonstrated their diversity in karst water and speleothems. However,knowledge of their origin and transfer from soil needs to be improved especially in karst environmentswhere a mosaic of soils occurs. Here we investigate {{the applicability of the}} Electron ParamagneticResonance (EPR) signature of OM to seek different soil fingerprints in speleothems. The positions andthe shapes of semiquinone-type radical’s EPR lines are considered as a robust signature of the organicmatter through the different compartment of karst ecosystems. We demonstrate that the combinationof EPR lines simulation constitutes a fingerprint that discriminates folic <b>Leptosol</b> developed on limestoneoutcrops from eutric Cambisols located in the dolines and topographical depressions. We also report theconservation of the thinner OM EPR lines after a water extraction of the organic matter from soils. Finally,OM EPR signatures were detected in two different speleothems sampled near each other: a stalagmiteand a subaqueous flowstone. An unexpected two-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between the free radicalconcentrations of the subaqueous flowstone and the soils on one hand, and the low free radical concentrationof the stalagmite samples on the other, was ascribed to the kinetics of conformational changesin OM occurring during their transfer through karst either in fast or in slow water pathways. A folicLeptosol fingerprint was found in stalagmite and conversely, an eutric Cambisol fingerprint was foundin the flowstone sample. This unexpected difference between the EPR signatures of the flowstone sampleand stalagmite sample was ascribed to the masking of the <b>Leptosol</b> EPR signature (due to the low concentrationsof free radicals) {{in the case of the}} flowstone sample and to the fact that the EPR signature of thestalagmite sample clearly shows the <b>Leptosol</b> is the sole source of the OM. Finally, the folic Leptosolfingerprint remains steady over the last four centuries covered by the stalagmite demonstrating thatthe source of the OM is stable over the growth period strengthening the interest of OM entrapped inspeleothem for paleoenvironment studies...|$|E

40|$|Proglacial {{areas in}} the Alps usually cover a time span of {{deglaciation}} of about 150 years (time {{since the end of}} the "Little Ice Age" in the 1850 s). In these proglacial areas soils have started to develop. In view of the foreseeable climate change, the time factor is of growing interest with respect to the landscape and consequently the soil development. We investigated soil changes (primarily on the basis of soil types) in the proglacial area Morteratsch (Swiss Alps) to derive time trends that can be used as a basis for spatial modeling. Differences in the soil development could be primarily interpreted in view of the time scale and topography (landscape shape, slope, aspect). Data was managed with GIS and regression analyses. Input data sets were the digital soil map, the glacial states, and the digital elevation model. The calculations were done raster based (GRID, 20 m resolution). After about 20 years the first signs of soil development could be found. Around 25 % of the area of the valley floor is covered with weakly developed Skeletic/Lithic <b>Leptosol</b> after about 30 years of deglaciation. One hundred years of soil development led to a strong decrease of the Skeletic/Lithic <b>Leptosol</b> in favor of the Humi-Skeletic <b>Leptosol</b> and Ranker. Fluvisols and Cambisols play a subordinate role also after 100 - 150 years. Undisturbed and fast soil evolution was measured in flat positions and on slopes up to about 14 °. In general, the various landforms also correlated well with soil evolution. One of the most surprising facts was that the weathering between southand north-facing sites differed distinctly, with the north-facing sites having the higher weathering rates. Soil moisture seems to be a decisive factor in weathering. Thicker snow packs probably inhibit or reduce soil frost and allow larger fluxes of snowmelt water to infiltrate into already moist profiles. Slope, exposure and to a lesser extent also the landform determined the soil development: these influences could be quantified using regression analyses. These analyses serve as a basis for further spatio-temporal modeling...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{particularly}} increasing frequency of drought events during the vegetation period may threaten tree vitality and forest biomass productivity in many temperate {{regions in the}} future. In that context, the identification of critical environmental factors and {{a better understanding of}} their impact on forests are decisive. The water balance is {{recognized as one of the}} most important soil factors for stand productivity in temperate forests. Hence, the consequences of short or long term climate change might vary considerably spatially in function of soil type within a given forest. Our study objective was to assess the impact of contrasting soil types on the water balance and stand growth of a beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest ecosystem of similar age and management during four climatically contrasting years. The experimental forest site of Montiers presents different soils with contrasting physicochemical properties (Dystric Cambisol, Eutric Cambisol and Rendzic <b>Leptosol)</b> monitored to quantify water fluxes and stand biomass increment. Using data collected over the period 2012 - 2015, including a particularly dry year (- 24 % precipitations in 2015), we also quantified the impact of water shortage on stand productivity at the annual scale as a function of soil type. We evidenced important differences in soil water holding capacities (SWHC) along the studied soil sequence, ranging between 57 mm for the Rendzic <b>Leptosol</b> downhill over limestone and 205 mm for the Dystric Cambisol uphill over detrital sediments. The results show that the canopy intercepted the same amount of incident rainfall in the three plots and that there were no significant differences in annual soil moisture dynamics among the studied soils. We evidenced different rooting patterns depending on soil type. Under a same climate and with stand, site exposition and solar radiation equivalency, trees transpiration was the evident primary driver of the stand potential to produce aboveground biomass. Soil water holding capacity, annual trees transpiration and aboveground biomass production increased in that order: Rendzic <b>Leptosol</b> < Eutric Cambisol < Dystric Cambisol.

40|$|Vertical matter {{transfer}} processes (bioturbation and < 2 μm translocation) in {{soils and}} their dynamics {{are up to}} now poorly constrained although {{they are responsible for}} the temporal evolution of the ecosystem services. In order to better constrain and quantify these processes, a kinetic quantification of the involved transfers based on vertical profiles of 210 Pb (xs), 10 Be and 137 Cs has been developed for Luvisols in which soluble transfers could be neglected. The range of applicability of this type of approach was nevertheless not tested. In this work, we analyzed 210 Pb (xs), 10 Be and 137 Cs in soils exhibiting gradients of organic matter, pH and < 2 μm fraction (Podzol, Andosol Ferralsol, <b>Leptosol).</b> Acidic soils and large organic matter contents were considered. The depth distribution of the studied isotopes was then interpreted {{as a function of the}} organic matter content, the soil pH and its < 2 μm fraction. This demonstrates that 10 Be and 137 Cs losses occur under soluble form in the Podzol, especially under forest, more acid, for the latter. Soluble 10 Be transfers were also identified in the Andosol when they were considered as negligible in the <b>Leptosol.</b> For 210 Pb (xs), soluble transfers are also probable for soils with pH less than 5. 5 (Andosol and Ferralsol) and strong affinity for organic matter has been demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how the presence of Cu influences tebuconazole (Teb) sorption onto contrasting soil types and two important constituents of the soil sorption complex: hydrated Fe oxide and humic substances. Tebuconazole was used in commercial form and as an analytical-grade chemical at different Teb/Cu molar ratios (1 : 4, 1 : 1, 4 : 1, and Teb alone). Increased Cu concentrations had a positive effect on tebuconazole sorption onto most soils and humic substances, probably as a result of Cu−Teb tertiary complexes on the soil surfaces. Tebuconazole sorption increased in the following order of different Teb/Cu ratios 1 : 4 [*]>[*] 1 : 1 [*]>[*] 4 : 1 [*]>[*]without Cu addition, with the only exception for the <b>Leptosol</b> and ferrihydrite. The highest Kf value was observed for humic substances followed by ferrihydrite, the Cambisol, the Arenosol, and the <b>Leptosol.</b> The sorption of analytical-grade tebuconazole onto all matrices was lower, but the addition of Cu supported again tebuconazole sorption. The Teb/Cu ratio with the highest Cu addition (1 : 4) exhibited the highest Kf values in all matrices with the exception of ferrihydrite. The differences in tebuconazole sorption can be attributed to the additives present in the commercial product.
