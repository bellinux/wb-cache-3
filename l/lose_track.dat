As they escape, Kwai's syndicate <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

25|$|Both sides had {{lessons to}} learn from the battle. The Germans had assumed that their cruisers, leaving port one by one, would not meet larger ships or major forces. They failed to keep their ships {{together}} so they might have better odds in any engagement.

Goodenough, on the other hand, had managed to <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of two cruisers, which therefore played no further part in the battle.|$|E
25|$|Home, however, was {{not easily}} reached. Louis and Eleanor, on {{separate}} ships {{due to their}} disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south to the Barbary Coast and caused her to <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached Palermo in Sicily, where she discovered {{that she and her}} husband had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King Roger II of Sicily, until the king eventually reached Calabria, and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in Potenza, she learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from Marseilles, they went to see Pope Eugene III in Tusculum, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the Commune of Rome.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to The Man from London generally praised its formalist aesthetic and painstakingly composed scenes, while criticizing its slow pace {{and lack of}} a compelling plot. Most argued the film fell short of Tarr's previous efforts. Varietys Derek Elley rated the film {{on a par with}} his Damnation (1988) but as inferior to Sátántangó (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000), remarking it was improbable that The Man From London would {{put an end to the}} polarization of Tarr's audiences into those who hail him as a director of [...] "visionary genius" [...] and those for whom he is a [...] "crashing bore". Martin Tsai of The New York Sun allowed that Tarr [...] "makes it easy for viewers to get lost in his beautifully bleak world and <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of time" [...] but complained that in comparison with its predecessors, the film's central theme of guilt seemed insubstantial and the film itself felt [...] "slight and incomplete".|$|E
500|$|The intuition {{for what}} happens above is that the Codd tables {{representing}} the projections in the subqueries <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> {{of the fact that}} [...] the Nulls in the columns F12.F2 and F23.F2 are actually copies of the originals in the table J. This observation suggests that a relatively simple improvement of Codd tables (which works correctly for this example) would be to use Skolem constants (meaning Skolem functions which are also constant functions), say ω12 and ω22 instead of a single NULL symbol. Such an approach, called v-tables or Naive tables, is computationally less expensive that the c-tables discussed above. However it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v-tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection (and not using any set difference either). The first example considered in this section is using a negative selection clause, WHERE Age <> 22, so it is also an example where v-tables queries would not report sure information.|$|E

500|$|When {{the design}} team was {{deciding}} {{on the number}} of Hunters in a match, they chose four as they believed it was the optimal number in a team, as players would not <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of the stats and health of other players. It also allowed the players to work collaboratively with each other, so that no character would get left behind, or neglected, by the team. From the Monster's perspective, the design team thought that having four Hunters engaging in combat with the Monster would provide a challenge for the Monster, as they could find difficulties in keeping track of the Hunters, and this would make a match feel more balanced. The Hunter team was divided into several different classes because it [...] "makes senses" [...] according to Turtle Rock. In order to showcase the features and abilities of different classes, each class has different variations, in both appearances and costume colors. It was designed to make characters more recognizable and memorable. Another reason was that the design team wanted the Monster to adapt and use different strategies when dealing with different Hunters. Turtle Rock considered this a way to effectively extend Evolves replayability and would add more variety to the gameplay. There were originally four Hunter characters in Evolve, but after the design team experimented with the free-to-play model, the list of characters was expanded to 16.|$|E

500|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} coined as [...] "Hoorah Henry" [...] in 1936 by American author Damon Runyon in his short story [...] "Tight Shoes". Runyon used it when describing his character Calvin Colby, a rich layabout, saying, [...] "He is without strict doubt a Hoorah Henry, {{and he is}} generally figured as nothing but a lob as far as doing anything useful in this world is concerned". Albert Jack challenges the idea that Runyon made the term popular, crediting Jim Godbolt with the correct explanation of its popularity. Godbolt remembers that in 1951 {{it was used to}} refer to the fans of Old Etonian jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton who would turn up in droves to the 100 Club in Oxford Street, London and shout in loud, upper class voices between songs, [...] "Hooray!, Hooray!". Lyttelton himself has commented on the term but credits Runyon with coining it; he once stated in an interview, [...] "In jazz circles, aggressively [...] "upper class" [...] characters are known as Hoorays, an adaption, I believe, of Damon Runyon's [...] "Hooray Henries". For the English language specialist David Crystal, the term is usually given to the [...] "loud-mouthed ineffectual upper class twit". He explains that it began appearing in British literature in the 1950s, although the Americans then [...] "seemed to <b>lose</b> <b>track</b> of the term". As a result, it was often included in British English guides in order to assist Americans. By the 1960s, the term was likened to Sloane Rangers, a term later applied to women such as Lady Diana Spencer before she married Prince Charles.|$|E

In [...] "Abyss", Davis confesses to Chloe that he is in love with her, and believes that she is marrying the wrong man; as a result she asks him to not see her again. On Chloe's wedding day, in the episode [...] "Bride", Davis transforms into the hulking monster called Doomsday, and travels to Smallville where he injures Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. In the episode [...] "Infamous", Davis discovers that he can keep Doomsday from emerging if he kills, and subsequently begins choosing criminals as his victims. He subsequently learns that Chloe's presence will also keep the monster at bay in the episode [...] "Turbulence", and in [...] "Beast" [...] Davis and Chloe leave town together so that Davis can keep Doomsday from coming out. In the season eight finale, Chloe uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday, leaving him human; when Davis discovers that Chloe does not love him he stabs Jimmy with a pipe.
