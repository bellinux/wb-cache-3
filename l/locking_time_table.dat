50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>time</b> is {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} sear and the {{ignition}} of the cartridge. A lengthy <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> and reduce the window for error. Reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing pin or striker, shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring. Further reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time,</b> to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers.|$|R

The solution introduced here proceeds in two phases: {{the construction of a}} <b>time</b> <b>table</b> that generally is not optimal, and a subsequent improvement of the <b>time</b> <b>table.</b> The first phase was successful solved using constraint programming (finite domain), the second one was realized as a multi-agent system.

Introduction The <b>time</b> <b>tabling</b> approach described in this paper was inspired by the way in which school <b>time</b> <b>tables</b> were made in those <b>times</b> when <b>time</b> <b>tabling</b> programs were not yet available.

40|$|AbstractMastering long {{division}} algorithm {{requires a}} good understanding of the meaning of division, knowledge of the <b>times</b> <b>tables,</b> subtraction skills and also the ability to estimate because it comprises several important principles. Using “Big Number Times Tables” (BNTT) can make the teaching and learning of long division algorithm much easier. BNTT needs children to only memorizing <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> up to table 9. Instead of doing trial and error as they normally do, children are guided to build the <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> systematically and they can build their own <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> with bigger number. Results of the early research show that majority children chose to use big number <b>times</b> <b>table</b> to solve problems because they make less error. Since BNTT guides children to build <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> in a systematic way, this gives the children the confidence to proceed with all the problems given. Teachers also find this technique very helpful. Furthermore, once anyone understands the steps being taken, BNTT can be used not only with one or two digits numbers but it can be applied with any bigger number which has more than two digits...|$|R

A modified successive approximation register-controller reduces the <b>locking</b> <b>time</b> and allows the DCC to follow the process, voltage, temperature, and load variations (PVDL). The MSARDCC circuit has been implemented in a 0. 18 - μm CMOS process which corrects the duty rate within 5 cycles which has a closed loop characteristic.

40|$|A seven-state phase {{frequency}} detector (S. S PFD) is proposed for fast-locking charge pump based phase-locked loops (CPPLLs) in this paper. The <b>locking</b> <b>time</b> of the PLL can be significantly reduced {{by using the}} seven-state PFD to inject more current into the loop filter. In this stage, the bandwidth of the PLL is increased or decreased to track the phase difference of the reference signal and the feedback signal. The proposed architecture is realized in a standard 0. 35 mu m 2 P 4 M CMOS process with a 3. 3 V supply voltage. The <b>locking</b> <b>time</b> of the proposed PLL is 1. 102 mu s compared with the 2. 347 mu s of the PLL based on continuous-time PFD and the 3. 298 mu s of the PLL based on the pass-transistor tri-state PFD. There are 53. 05 % and 66. 59 % reductions of the <b>locking</b> <b>time.</b> The simulation results and the comparison with other PLLs demonstrate that the proposed seven-state PFD is effective to reduce <b>locking</b> <b>time.</b> IEEE Beijing Sect.; Chinese Inst Elect.; IEEE Electron Devices Soc.; IEEE EDS Beijing Chapter.; IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc.; IEEE Circuites & Syst Soc.; IEEE Hong Kong EDS, SSCS Chapter.; IEEE SSCS Beijing Chapter.; Japan Soc Appl Phys.; Elect Div IEEE.; URSI Commiss D.; Inst Elect Engineers Korea.; Assoc Asia Pacific Phys Soc.; Peking Univ, IEEE EDS Student Chapter...|$|R
