40|$|Increasing {{political}} and social awareness {{of the importance of}} protecting the geological heritage is compelling geoscientists to consider new methods for reconciling conservation and exploration of their research sites. Terrestrial <b>Light</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>And</b> <b>Range</b> (LiDAR) imaging is an accurate method of collecting 3 D spatial data that has so far been under-utilized in the geological sciences. This aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the value of integrated LiDAR and photogrammetric imaging as a tool for synchronizing scientific exploration with conservation of geological heritage sites.   Fumanya (Catalonia) is one of the most important Cretaceous tracksites in Europe, but the nature of exposure of the track-bearing surface has hindered quantitative documentation of the ichnites. Using integrated <b>Light</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>And</b> <b>Range</b> (LiDAR) imaging <b>and</b> photogrammetry it has been possible to construct high-resolution Digital Outcrop Models (DOM) of the tracksites. Photo-textured DOMs are a powerful visualization tool and function as fully 3 D interactive databases that preserve information about the site that would otherwise be lost to erosion. LiDAR-derived DOMs have the potential to contribute profoundly to future geoconservation projects, particularly as a tool for documenting and monitoring heritage sites and promoting education and tourism.

This represents a considerable advance for the science of vertebrate ichnology in which tra-ditional field methods suffer from a significant degree of abstraction and lack the resolution required to interpret tracks quantitatively. Three-dimensional LiDAR models pro-vide additional morphometric information and allow the application of new analytical tools unique to the digital envi-ronment. The method will enable fossil track morphometrics to develop into an iterative process that combines 3 D visuali-zation and multivariate statistical methods, blending qualita-tive and quantitative approaches and allowing track morphologies to be compared holistically.

500|$|Scientists {{have studied}} the {{characteristics}} of cirrus using several different methods. One, <b>Light</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ranging</b> (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried hygrometers give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure {{the depth of the}} cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth's infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the [...] "shadow" [...] it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.|$|E

A biannual bird census was conducted at this site during the breeding seasons of 2009 and 2010. Census data combined with the three-dimensional map suggest that local breeding bird abundance, community structure, and spatial distribution patterns are highly influenced by vertical heterogeneity of vegetation surface. For local breeding birds, vertical heterogeneity of canopy surface within stands, connectivity to adjacent forest patches, largest forest patch index, and habitat (vegetation) types proved to be the most influential factors to determine bird community assemblages. Results also highlight the critical role of secondary forests to increase functional connectivity of forest patches. Overall, three-dimensional habitat descriptions derived from integrated LiDAR and hyperspectral data serve as a powerful bird conservation tool that shows how the distribution of bird species relates to forest composition and structure at various scales...|$|R

Furthermore, our approach allows the attachment of large-scale geospatial meta information and the modification of point attributes on the fly. The core of our algorithm is a dynamic GPU-based hierarchical tree data structure that is {{used in conjunction with}} an out-of-core, Levelof-Detail (LoD) -Point-based Rendering (PBR) algorithm to modify data on the fly.

Specifically, we described the morphological profile of each EC habitat based on the morphological variables that are most likely to affect their occurrence, including elevation, slope, curvature, northness, eastness and sea distance. In addition, we assessed the role and strength of each morphological variable in determining the occurrence of EC habitats. We used 394 random vegetation plots representative of six EC habitats (Habitat 1210 : “Annual vegetation of drift lines”; Habitat 2110 : “Embryonic shifting dunes”; Habitat 2120 : “Shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria”; Habitat 2210 and 2230 : “Crucianellion maritimae fixed beach dunes” and “Malcolmietalia dune grasslands”; Habitat 2250 : “Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. ”; Habitat 2260 : “Cisto-Lavanduletalia dune sclerophyllous scrubs”) found along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. We derived each morphological variable from a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) obtained from 2 -m resolution LiDAR (<b>Light</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>And</b> <b>Range)</b> images. The mean value of each variable was calculated at different spatial scales using buffer areas of increasing radius (2  m, 4  m, 8  m) around each vegetation plot. Mean morphological values for each EC habitat were compared using Kruskal-Wallis rank test. The role and strength of the relationship between habitat type and the morphological variables were assessed using Generalized Linear Models. EC habitats occur differentially across dune morphology, and the role and strength of each morphological variable define habitat specificity. Dune elevation and sea distance were determined to be the key factors in shaping EC habitat occurrence along this section of the Mediterranean coast. Identification of the close relationship between habitat type and morphological variables deriving from airborne LiDAR imagery points to the high potential of such remote sensing tool for analyzing and monitoring the integrity of coastal dune ecosystems.

The ICRH went through a number of design stages and shutdown gamma ray dose rates were determined for each stage. It was determined that of all the designs analysed only one of them, the ﬁrst concept design for the internally matched design did not meet the shutdown dose criteria.

Methods to properly sample eddies using eddy-covariance were established, where analysis showed that a 90 -minute Reynold’s averaging period was optimal to sample most eddies. Additionally, a case study was used to demonstrate the additional atmospheric parameters which can be calculated from profiles of water vapor flux, such as the water vapor flux convergence/divergence. Flux footprints calculated at multiple heights within the convective boundary layer also show how a surface based instrument is sampling a completely different source than one taking measurements above 300 m.

40|$|Monogenetic basaltic {{volcanism}} is characterised by {{a complex}} array of behaviours in the {{spatial distribution of}} magma output and also temporal variability in magma flux and eruptive frequency. For understanding monogenetic volcanoes different topographic and remote sensing-based information can be used, such as Digital Surface Models (DSMs). These data are most appropriately analysed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). In this study a systematic dataset of the Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF), New Zealand, was collected and pre-processed to extract quantitative parameters, such as eruptive volumes, sedimentary unit thicknesses, areas affected, spatial locations, and topographic positions. The topographic datasets available for the AVF were Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), contour-based Digital Elevation Models, <b>and</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>And</b> <b>Range</b> (LiDAR) datasets. These were validated by comparing their elevations to high accuracy ground control reference data from multiple Real-Time- Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System and Terrestrial Laser Scanning surveys. The attribute extraction was carried out on the LiDAR DSM, which had the best vertical accuracy of ≤ 0. 3 m. The parameterisation of monogenetic volcanoes and their eruptive products included the extraction of eruptive volumes, areas covered by deposits, identification of eruptive styles based on their sedimentary characteristics and landform geomorphology. A new conceptual model for components of a monogenetic volcanic field was developed for standardising eruptive volume calculations and tested at the AVF. In this model, a monogenetic volcano is categorised in six parts, including diatremes beneath phreatomagmatic volcanoes, or crater infills, scoria/spatter cones, tephras rings and lava flows. The most conservative estimate of the total Dense Rock Equivalent eruptive volume for the AVF is 1. 704 km 3. The temporal-volumetric evolution of the AVF is characterised by a higher magma flux over the last 40 ky, {{which may have been}} triggered by plate tectonic processes (e. g. increased asthenospheric shearing and back-arc spreading underneath the Auckland region). The eruptive volumes were correlated with the sequences of eruption styles preserved in the pyroclastic record, and environmental influencing factors, such as distribution and thickness of water-saturated post-Waitemata sediments, topographic position, distance from the sea and known fault lines. The past eruptive sequences are characterised by a large scatter without any initially obvious trend in relation to any of the four influencing factors. The influencing factors, however, showed distinct differences between subdomains of the field, i. e. North Shore, Central Auckland and Manukau Lowlands. Based on the spatial variability of these environmental factors, a susceptibility conceptual model was provided for the AVF. Based on the comparison of area affected by eruption styles and eruptive volume, lava flow inundation is the most widespread hazard of the field. To account for this, a topographically adaptive numerical method was developed to model the susceptibility for lava flow inundation in the AVF. This approach distinguished two different hazard profiles for the valley-dominated Central Auckland and North Shore regions, and the flat Manukau Lowlands. A numerical lava flow simulation code, MAGFLOW, was applied to understand the eruption and rheological properties of the past AVF lava flow in the Central Auckland area. Based on the simulation of past lava flows, three eruptive volume-based effusive eruption scenarios were developed that best characterise the range of hazards expected. To synthesise, susceptibility mapping was carried out to reveal the patterns in expected future eruption styles of the AVF, based on the eruptive volumes and environmental factors. Based on the susceptibility map, the AVF was classified as highly susceptible to phreatomagmatic vent-opening eruptions caused by external environmental factors. This susceptibility map was further combined with eruptive volumes of past phreatomagmatic phases in order to provide an eruption sequence forecasting technique for monogenetic volcanic fields. Combining numerical methods with conceptual models is a new potential direction for producing the next generation of volcanic hazard and susceptibility maps in monogenetic volcanic fields. These maps could improve and standardise hazard assessment of monogenetic volcanic fields, raising the preparedness for future volcanic unrest...|$|R
