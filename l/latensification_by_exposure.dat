40|$|A uniform {{secondary}} {{exposure of}} low intensity {{is made to}} a normal or underexposed primary latent image for approximately 5 - 15 minutes, to increase the effective speed index. This is first studied from a white light approach {{similar to that used}} in single emulsion negative materials. In addition, the ability to manipulate and align individual layers by selective filtering was also studied. Red, green and blue filters, matched closely to the spectral sensitivity of each layer, were used separately and conjunctively towards achievement of the desired levels of effective speed, contrast, color balance and maximum density. <b>Latensification</b> <b>by</b> a secondary white light exposure increases the effective A. S. A. speed of specific layers by as much as 2 1 / 2 f/stops. Through selective filtering, an ability to increase speed and align two or more layers has been demonstrated. The effective overall speed of Ektachrome-X film has been increased by a factor of ~ (2) but at the expense of losses in Dmax.; contrast; and color balance...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{conditions}} of a low-altitude, rapid access photographic system, a method of simultaneously intensifying image exposures is compared to low intensity latensification. The simultaneous intensification resulted in a speed increase of 2. 4 times, while latensification produced a speed increase of 1. 7 times. Latensification was more effective {{in most of the}} other responses that were analyzed: reduction of Contrast Index was less by 0. 1; speed at the minimum gradient point defined by the untreated strips was increased <b>by</b> <b>latensification</b> <b>by</b> 1. 29 times compared to 1. 23 times by simultaneous intensification. The detective quantum efficiency of the latensified film was higher than that produced by simultaneous intensification except for the extreme toe region where simultaneous intensification did increase information content. The maximum DQE found for the untreated film was maintained by latensification; the simultaneously intensified film showed a reduction of maximum DQE by 0. 66. Because latensification permitted density increases with less loss of contrast, it was found to be the more effective treatment in terms of information, except in the extreme toe, leading to certain compromises. Simultaneous intensification may be suitable only for specialized applications in which use of an exposure in the extreme toe is required over optimum pictorial exposures...|$|R
