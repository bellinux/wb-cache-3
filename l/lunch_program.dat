5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school <b>lunch</b> <b>program,</b> and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school <b>lunch</b> <b>program,</b> and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school <b>lunch</b> <b>program</b> {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school <b>lunch</b> <b>program</b> thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} current {{childhood}} obesity health crises in the United States {{and the potential}} solutions of school garden and farm-to-cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs.</b> The study of school garden and farm-to-cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> investigates an environmental problem from a health outcomes perspective. Previously published, accredited scientific articles are systematically reviewed to identify both the success and failures of these programs, in addition to defining areas needing greater research. The research and data collected in the systematic review is later used to suggest a set of best practices for school garden and farm-to-cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs.</b> School garden and farm-to-cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> offer viable solutions for the obesity epidemic that necessitates a change...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the cost effectiveness of two selected satellite <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> in Indiana public schools in order to determine if such sattelite <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> have met expectations of savings of money over traditional cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs.</b> Procedures and MethodologyThe components of the <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> investigated included (1) construction costs, (2) equipment costs, (3) labor costs, (4) supply costs, (5) food costs, (6) maintenance costs, (7) repair costs, (8) transportation costs, and (9) administrative costs. The existing satellite <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> were compared to projected cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> for the same populations and for the same time frame. Data was gathered directly from annual reports of the school corporations involved and through interviews with the directors of Food Services; and interview guide sanctioned by a representative of the Nutrition and Foods Division of the Department of Public Instruction of the State of Indiana was used in the data gathering. FindingsLabor costs were found to be the single largest factor in the comparison of the two types of food service programs; other factors affecting the comparison were supply costs, maintenance costs, and administrative costs. Although supply costs and transportation costs were less for the projected cafeteria <b>lunch</b> <b>programs,</b> the difference did not off-set the increased costs of labor, equipment, maintenance, space, and administrative services. In the final analysis, the satellite <b>lunch</b> <b>programs</b> were viewed as having fulfilled the expectation of saving money in both construction and operational costs. Recommendations for Further StudySome of the aspects of the study which were viewed as deserving further study included (1) investigation into a standardized accounting procedure, (2) examination of possibilities for more effective use of surplus commodities, and (3) study of the quality of the food service programs from the viewpoint of the consumers.

The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate.

500|$|While {{some school}} districts have their own suppliers, many school districts {{purchase}} beef directly from the USDA and {{do not know what}} is in the beef.

An analysis of California Department of Education data indicated that [...] "anywhere from none to nearly 3 million pounds of beef from the USDA that was served in California schools last year could have contained lean finely textured beef".
