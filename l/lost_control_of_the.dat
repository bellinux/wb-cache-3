5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate {{the hero of the}} opposition party.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action.|$|E

5|$|In 1630 Palmyra {{came under}} the {{authority}} of another Lebanese prince, Fakhr-al-Din II, who renovated Shirkuh II's castle (which became known as Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle). The prince fell from grace with the Ottomans in 1633 and <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, which remained a separate sanjak until it was absorbed by Zor Sanjak in 1857. The village became home to an Ottoman garrison to control the Bedouin in 1867.|$|E
5|$|In October 1139, Talbot {{was once}} more in charge of Hereford and {{withstood}} an attack by Miles of Gloucester, at that time a supporter of King Stephen. By 1140, he had <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle and was attempting {{to regain control of}} it. Part of his efforts included fortifying Hereford Cathedral. He was joined in his siege efforts by Miles of Gloucester, who had switched sides and was then supporting Matilda.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2012, {{he died in}} a {{car crash}} under {{controversial}} circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle and collided with a tree, while Payá's children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the car had been deliberately run off of the road.|$|E

All three were killed instantly. Nancy was 19; Brown, 25; and Powell, 24.|$|E
5|$|After Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, Rijadi led Indonesian {{forces in}} the Surakarta area during the revolution against the returning Dutch. Starting with a guerrilla campaign, by 1947, when he fought against Dutch offensives in Ambarawa and Semarang, {{he was in charge}} of the 26th Regiment. During a second Dutch offensive, Rijadi <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city but soon retook it, later leading counter-offensives in West Java. In 1950, after the end of the revolution, Rijadi was sent to the Moluccas to put down a rebellion. After several months of planning and a month crossing Ambon Island, Rijadi was killed near the end of the operation by a rebounding bullet.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese {{began to focus}} on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. The unmanageable plane, at a speed of 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, {{as well as a}} dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E
5|$|Muslims {{under the}} Rashidun Caliphate {{from what is}} now Saudi Arabia, invaded the region from the south. The Arab Christian Ghassanids, clients of the Byzantines, were {{defeated}} despite imperial support. While the Muslim forces lost to the Byzantines in their first direct engagement during the Battle of Mu'tah in 629, {{in what is now}} the Karak Governorate, the Byzantines <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Levant when they were defeated by the Rashidun army in 636 at the Battle of Yarmouk just north of modern-day Jordan. The region was Arabized, and the Arabic language became widespread.|$|E
5|$|Ryholt's {{hypothesis}} regarding Sheshi {{comes with}} his dating {{the start of}} the 14th Dynasty around 1805 BC, over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists. They propose instead that the 14th Dynasty emerged during the two decades of Merneferre Ay's reign, which is dated to between 1700 BC and 1660 BC, depending on the scholar. Ay is the last 13th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt, and most scholars therefore contend that he abandoned Itjtawy, the capital of Egypt since the reign of Amenemhat I (c. 1980 BC), in favor of Thebes as he <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delta region to the 14th Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Huế and Da Nang did not {{spell the}} end of the misery {{suffered}} by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On March 31, ARVN General Phạm Văn Phú—commander of II Corps Tactical Zone—attempted to form a new defensive line from Qui Nhơn to cover the retreat of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division into the Mekong Delta, but they too were destroyed by the North Vietnamese. By April 2, South Vietnam had <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern provinces, as well as two army corps.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E

5|$|After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, Damascus and {{the citadel}} {{surrendered}} peacefully to the Ottomans. Damascus {{was given to}} Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took the citadel. He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed {{in the vicinity of}} Damascus in 1521. Damascus again changed hands, to the Ottomans. From 1658 onward, the citadel was controlled by the Janissaries—Ottoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citadel in 1746. The north gate of the citadel collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put his hand down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E
5|$|Chesney served {{again as}} the leader of Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent peace settlement, the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had <b>lost</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was with Henry, as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as exemption for payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E
