2500|$|On March 11, 1958, a U.S. Air Force Boeing B-47E-LM Stratojet from Hunter Air Force Base {{operated}} by the 375th Bombardment Squadron of the 308th Bombardment Wing near Savannah, Georgia, took off at approximately 4:34 PM and was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom and then to North Africa as part of Operation Snow Flurry. The aircraft was carrying nuclear weapons on board {{in the event of}} war with the Soviet Union breaking out. Air Force Captain Bruce Kulka, who was the navigator and bombardier, was summoned to the bomb bay area after the captain of the aircraft, Captain Earl Koehler, had encountered a fault light in the cockpit indicating that the bomb harness <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> did not engage. As Kulka reached around the bomb to pull himself up, he mistakenly grabbed the emergency release pin. The Mark 6 nuclear bomb dropped {{to the floor of the}} B-47 and the weight forced the bomb bay doors open, sending the bomb [...] down to the ground below.|$|E

50|$|On 16 October 1961, Fokker F27-100 Friendship ZK-BXB Kotuku, {{moments from}} {{boarding}} passerngers and crew at Invercargill airport suffered an undercarriage failure when the portside main leg retracted. Ground crew had just removed the safety <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> when the leg retracted. It {{was discovered that}} an undercarriage selector valve had failed.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

50|$|The Nokia Asha 310 {{contains}} many general security features: Device <b>lock,</b> <b>PIN</b> code and device lock password. The phone also contains the following Wi-Fi security modes: WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), WEP (Wired Equivalent Protection), WPA2 (AES/TKIP), WPA2-Personal, WPA-Personal.|$|R
5000|$|Safe {{cracking}} {{is opening}} a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method {{that can be}} used on many safes is [...] "safe bouncing", which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> to budge, opening the safe.|$|E
50|$|At {{the summit}} on the {{northern}} side there is a concrete roofed bunker (now semi-collapsed), excavated into the rocky outcrop, in association with a pit with circular concrete base and an embedded metal cylinder stood vertical. The metal cylinder has a handle and <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> This device {{is thought to be}} associated with a fixed machine gun. The pit is semi-ringed with excavated earth/rock.|$|E
50|$|The bridge has {{experienced}} numerous {{problems in the}} past, due partly to its age, but mainly due to the increasing numbers of heavy goods vehicles and heavily laden farm vehicles which ignore the weight limit on the bridge. Issues have included the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> falling out of place, cracks forming in the supporting structure, and jamming of the swing mechanism, which has caused heavy traffic delays and tailbacks.|$|E
50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R
50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R
5000|$|Monolock Hinge: The {{purpose of}} this design {{is to create a}} lower profile receiver. The system {{integrates}} the hinge and locking system. The MonoLock Hinge pivots on significantly more surface area than guns with conventional low profile receivers. Rectangular <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> provide additional strength while a wear-in relief feature allows for wear without hindering lock-up.|$|R
50|$|When digging at a rock face, the {{operator}} simultaneously raises and extends the dipper stick {{to fill the}} bucket with material. When the bucket is full, the shovel is rotated to load a railway car or motor truck. The <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> on the bucket flap is released and the load drops away. The operator lowers the dipper stick, the bucket mouth self-closes, the pin relocks automatically and the process repeats.|$|E
50|$|A {{disc lock}} is a {{portable}} security device for motorcycles and scooters. Disc-locks use {{the holes in}} a motorcycle's or scooter's brake disc. A <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> passes {{through the hole in}} the brake disc and locks to the other side of the lock, using either a pushdown-and-click locking mechanism or a more robust double-locking mechanism. When in place, the disc-lock discourages theft by blocking the vehicle from being moved in either forward or reverse direction.|$|E
50|$|The lift span {{was left}} in situ for some years {{but in the end}} it too was demolished. Today the only {{reminders}} of the bridge are the eastern foot of the lifting section which is still in place, and the preserved <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> One of the pontoons was sunk at Alonnah, and remains in use as a public jetty. Another piece is sunk in Ralphs Bay, in about 40 feet of water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second is}} Castlewood's own adapter [...] "The ORB USB Smart Cable" [...] Part Number 88205-001 made in Taiwan (Male HD50 SCSI to USB). This single unit has two {{manually}} operated <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> {{to keep it}} firmly connected. The attached USB cable has a clear transparent cover incorporating eight toroidal ceramic surge suppressing magnets close to the adapter.|$|R
40|$|The {{lock screw}} of {{propeller}} spinner of an aircraft {{was found to}} have fractured by fatigue. Evidences suggest that excessive pre-tension due to over tightening of the lock screw is the most probable reason for the fatigue crack initiation. The failure of the locating and <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> is secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary fatigue failure of the lock screw...|$|R
40|$|Shield {{sections}} {{change their}} configuration to suit mining mode. Articulation cylinders raise rear shield to advance position, and locking cylinders hold it there. To change to retreat position articulation cylinders lower shield. <b>Locking</b> <b>pins</b> at edge of outermost shield plate latch shield to chock base. Shield accommodates roof heights ranging from 36 to 60 inches (0. 9 to 1. 52 meters) ...|$|R
50|$|The Puchacz is a {{construction}} protected by polyurethane paint {{rather than the}} more usual gelcoat finish. Although it is mainly glassfibre, the fuselage has two wooden frames as the connection point for the wings and undercarriage. Assembly entails inserting a single main pin to secure the wings in place and a spring-loaded <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> for the tailplane. The air brakes open {{above and below the}} wings and are extremely efficient in comparison with other gliders, allowing very steep flight.|$|E
5000|$|Further south, {{close to}} the {{southern}} edge of the third terrace, is another collapsed bunker with concrete roof and associated pit with circular concrete base and an embedded metal cylinder stood vertical. The metal cylinder has a handle and <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> The pit is semi-ringed with excavated earth/rock. This structure closely resembles the other at the summit. Two rock-piled [...] "sentry posts" [...] are found at slightly lower elevations near this second bunker/pit complex. They have roughly southern aspects.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 11 December 1981 and OMAC ("Old Man's Aircraft Company") initially {{hoped to}} obtain type certification by mid 1982. These efforts were delayed by an accident on the ground, {{and then a}} landing accident caused {{by the failure of}} a <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> on the undercarriage. A second prototype took to the air on 19 February 1983, and certification was expected [...] "no later than December 1984". Late in 1983, however, the certification process was still only in its preliminary stages.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2014, The FAA {{proposed}} a civil penalty of $204,050 against Sierra for [...] "allegedly operating nine Cessna 152 airplanes {{when they were}} not in compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations." [...] The FAA alleged that Sierra did not properly inspect the seat <b>locking</b> <b>pins.</b> An improperly engaged pin could lead to the seat slipping and the pilot losing control of the airplane.|$|R
5000|$|The server itself {{might have}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> {{on the sides}} that just drop into slots on the {{extended}} rail assembly, {{in a manner similar}} to a removable kitchen drawer. This permits very easy server installation and removal since there is no need for the server to be held in midair while someone fastens each rail to the sides of the server with screws.|$|R
50|$|The {{legs are}} then locked {{in place with}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins.</b> The {{carriage}} is lowered via the hydraulic jack so that the legs touch the ground; integral stakes are then hammered into the ground. At this point, the gun is ready for direct fire using the OP4 direct fire sight, or can be orientated and have its position fixed via the aiming circles for subsequent indirect fire using the Pantel sight.|$|R
5000|$|Flight 981, named TC-JAV or [...] "Ship 29", {{had been}} ordered from McDonnell-Douglas {{three months after the}} service {{bulletin}} was issued, and was delivered to Turkish Airlines three months later. Despite this, the changes required by the service bulletin (installation of a support plate for the handle linkage, preventing the bending of the linkage seen in the Flight 96 incident) had not been implemented. Through either oversight or deliberate fraud, the manufacturer construction logs however showed that this work had been carried out. In reality, an improper adjustment had been made to the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> and warning light mechanism, causing the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> travel to be reduced. This meant that the pins did not extend past the torque tube flanges, allowing the handle to be closed without excessive force (estimated by investigators to be around [...] ) despite the improperly engaged latches. These findings concurred with statements made by Mohammed Mahmoudi, the baggage handler who had closed the door on Flight 981; he noted that no particular amount of force was needed to close the locking handle. Changes had also been made to the warning light switch, so that it would turn off the cockpit warning light even if the handle was not fully closed.|$|E
50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a {{quick-release}} <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in 12-pontoon sections which were then towed out into the river and connected to the banks and {{to each other in}} the middle. The total volume of concrete used in making these pontoons was 11,000 cubic yards (8,400 m³). The two halves of the bridge were made of ten 131 ft pontoons, one 124 ft section, and one 138 ft section, joined in the middle by a 12+3/4 in vertical <b>locking</b> <b>pin,</b> which was saved when the bridge was demolished and is now on display outside the Royal Engineers Building in Hobart.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was based}} on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and {{featured}} a 302 in³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented bonnet (hood) with <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.|$|R
2500|$|On March 20, 2011, a lap {{bar on the}} Hi-Miler {{roller coaster}} at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo {{suddenly}} unlocked, causing a 47-year-old male guest to fall more than 28 feet from the roller coaster. The malfunction {{was caused by a}} single screw, which was supposed to keep the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> in place and the lap bar locked. [...] The victim sustained serious chest and head injuries, and later {{died as a result of}} his injuries.|$|R
50|$|Boli Khela or Bali Khela (বলীখেলা) is a {{traditional}} form of wrestling in Bangladesh, particularly popular in the Chittagong area considered as a national game of the district. It {{is a form of}} combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint <b>locks,</b> <b>pins</b> and other grappling holds. It {{is one of the oldest}} traditions of the Chittagong. The sporting event, held in the first month of the Bengali year, always takes place at Laldighi Maidan.|$|R
50|$|Barnes and Colson {{catch up}} to 777 and attempt to engage the coupling. Their {{attempts}} to connect with 777 cause the grain car seal to break and leak grain at a blinding rate. Colson notices the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> on the coupler is not engaged. He attempts to kick it in but the couple again impacts 1206 and Colson gets his right foot crushed in the process. However, {{he is able to}} hold on enough to fully engage the <b>locking</b> <b>pin.</b> Barnes works his way across 777 to its cab, manually engaging the brakes on the freight cars along the way, while Colson engages 1206's dynamic brakes, which initially slow down 777, but would prove to be no match for 777's speed. They are able to reduce the speed slow enough to clear the Stanton Curve without derailing by using the independent brake, but 777 remains out of control and threatens to crash into the Stanton train yard. Despite attempting to reach the locomotive by jumping on the cars, Barnes finds his path blocked to 777's cab, but Oldham arrives in his truck with a police convoy and drives on a parallel road to the tracks. Colson jumps to Oldham's truck, and Oldham drives him up to the front of 777 allowing Colson to get into the cab and engage the brakes. 777 is safely stopped before it reaches the end of the line.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{inexpensive}} safes sold to households for under $100 use mechanical locking mechanisms that {{are vulnerable to}} bouncing. Many cheap safes use a magnetic <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> to prevent lateral movement of an internal locking bolt, and use a solenoid to move the pin when the correct code is entered. This pin can also be moved by {{the impact of the}} safe being dropped or struck while on its side, which allows the safe to be opened. One security researcher taught his three-year-old son how to open most consumer gun safes. More expensive safes use a gear mechanism that is less susceptible to mechanical attacks.|$|E
50|$|The Second Series {{ran from}} 1947 to 1972. The ejector-rod {{was longer and}} had a groove in its knurled tip; a three-inch-barrel variant was offered, with a yet longer ejector-rod. The {{cylinder}} latch was smooth, and the trigger spur serrated. The right side frame screw has no <b>locking</b> <b>pin,</b> and the rear half of the front sight is a serrated ramp. The grip panels were plastic in 1947, but were changed back to wood starting in 1955 (first with a silver-tone Colt medallion, and later a gold-tone). An optional hammer shroud was available from the factory to prevent the hammer from catching on clothing.|$|E

5000|$|Although the Schottky-Mott model {{correctly}} {{predicted the}} existence of band bending in the semiconductor, it was found experimentally that it would give grossly incorrect predictions for {{the height of the}} Schottky barrier. A phenomenon referred to as [...] "Fermi level pinning" [...] caused some point of the band gap, at which DOS exists, to be <b>locked</b> (<b>pinned)</b> to the Fermi level. This made the Schottky barrier height almost completely insensitive to the metal's work function:where Ebandgap is the size of band gap in the semiconductor.|$|R
50|$|During the {{investigation}} of the near-crash of Flight 96, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that the DC-10's cargo door design was dangerously flawed. The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found {{that it was possible to}} close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. When the door blew out at altitude, the sudden decompression created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse. The collapse of the cabin floor severely damaged some of the vital flight control wires and hydraulic lines routed through the floor beams, which left the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.|$|R
