40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> is a hemiparasitic weed that is {{becoming}} increasingly problematic in hay fields in the northeastern United States. The biomass of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> was assessed in two experiments in which commercially available soil amendments were applied to an infested hay field under no-till management. The amendments were applied {{in the fall of}} 2010 and 2011 and included wood ash, biochar, hardwood sawdust, lime, and K. Wood ash applied at a rate of 8, 967 kg ha− 1 (4 tons per acre) had the greatest suppressive effect and reduced <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass the following summer by 86 and 92 % relative to the untreated control in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Two additional treatments included in Experiment 2, a doubled rate of wood ash and sawdust applied at a rate of 13, 450 kg ha− 1, also reduced <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass. No other treatments affected <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis that included aboveground plant community and soil biochemical data explained only 42. 4 % of the variation in <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for the suppression of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> by wood ash and sawdust are complex. Amending hay fields with wood ash or sawdust may be an effective nonherbicide strategy for managing <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> infestations. Additional research will be required to determine the mechanisms and generality of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> suppression by wood ash and sawdust amendments to the soil...|$|R

50|$|It can be {{cultivated}} by scarifying {{the surface}} of the ground with a fork or similar, then sowing onto short grass, 0.5 - 1 gram of seed per square metre. <b>Yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> seed is short-lived and should always be sown in the autumn, using seed harvested that year. Then, keep grass short for beginning of March when seedlings establish. Thereafter, the grass should not be cut until the end of July to allow the <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> to flower and go to seed, then cut short.|$|R
