Altgens <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> they {{were not required to}} attend.|$|E

5|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to reach the}} geographic South Pole was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. He and four others arrived at the pole on 14December 1911, five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott {{as part of the}} Terra Nova Expedition. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.|$|E

The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{this process was}} harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|Voluntary {{censorship}} of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After {{the start of}} the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the National Academy of Sciences to clear articles. William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who wrote an article for The Saturday Evening Post in September 1940 on atomic fission, <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue. The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov wrote to Josef Stalin on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E

She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov.

5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor <b>later</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
