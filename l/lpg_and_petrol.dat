Proton launched a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) variant of the Prevé exclusively for Thailand in early 2014. The Prevé LPG is fitted with a dedicated 58-litre tank in the boot and a fuel gauge module on the dashboard, {{as well as a}} separate inlet inside the petrol filler compartment.

40|$|The {{composition}} of exhaust emissions from eight in-service passenger cars powered by {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (<b>LPG)</b> <b>and</b> unleaded <b>petrol</b> (ULP) were measured on a chassis dynamometer at two driving speeds (60 and 80 kmh 1) with the aims of evaluating their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contents and investigating {{the effects of the}} type of fuel on vehicle performance, ambient air quality and associated health risks. Naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo(a) anthracene and benzo(b) fluoranthene were the most prominent PAHs emitted by both ULP <b>and</b> <b>LPG</b> powered cars. The total emission factors of PAHs from LPG cars were generally lower than (but statistically comparable with) those of ULP cars. Similarly, the total BAPeq of the PAHs emitted by LPG cars were lower than those from ULP cars. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods showed that cars powered by LPG fuel performed better than those powered by ULP fuel in term of PAH levels.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{real-world}} on-road {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) vehicle/taxi emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and nitric oxide (NO) were investigated. A regression analysis approach {{based on the measured}} LPG vehicle emission data was also used to estimate the on-road LPG vehicle emission factors of CO, HC and NO with respect to the effects of instantaneous vehicle speed and acceleration/deceleration profiles for local urban driving patterns. The results show that the LPG vehicle model years and driving patterns have a strong correlation to their emission factors. A unique correlation of LPG vehicle emission factors (i. e., g km- 1 and g l- 1) on different model years for urban driving patterns has been established. Finally, a comparison was made between the average <b>LPG,</b> <b>and</b> <b>petrol</b> [Chan, T. L., Ning, Z., Leung, C. W., Cheung, C. S., Hung, W. T., Dong, G., 2004.

40|$|The study {{monitored}} the emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from the exhaust of cars fuelled by liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> <b>and</b> unleaded <b>petrol</b> (ULP). Six cars, four fuelled by <b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> two by ULP, were tested on a chassis dynamometer at two different cruising modes of operation (60 km h− 1 and 80 km h− 1) and idle. A total of 33 VOCs were identified in the exhaust of both types of fuels {{by the use of}} GC/MS. Due to the complexity of the dataset, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) software PROMETHEE and GAIA was used to rank the least polluting mode and fuel. The 60 km h− 1 driving speed was identified as the cleaner mode of driving as was LPG fuel. The Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) of the VOCs was also calculated by using the incremental reactivity scale. Priority VOCs leading to ozone formation were identified according to the three incremental reactivity scales: MIR, MOIR and EBIR. PROMETHEE was applied to assess the most preferred scale of reactivity for predicting ozone formation potential under different scenarios. The results enhance the understanding of the environmental value of using LPG to power passenger cars...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} burning <b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> {{gasoline}} <b>and</b> dual fueled (<b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> gasoline) {{in the same}} engine, a new multi-function engine was refitted and designed based on 188 F gasoline, mutative effects on the power and emission performance when burning those three kind fuel were investigated by the engine operated with the US EPA Phase- II. Three schemes for the carburetor throat were designed. Balanced of the power and economy performance, when {{the diameter of the}} carburetor throat is 23 mm, the performance was the best. By carrying engine performance test and the combustion process analysis, the results showed that: when the throttle was full opened, the power of burning only gasoline was 7. 97 kW, 0. 5 kW and 0. 28 kW higher than burning <b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> dual –fuel. Burning gasoline pressure curve with the crank Angle siege area is the largest. As the emission test shows, when separately burning <b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> gasoline and dual fueled, the tendency of the excess air coefficient and the emission characteristics with the load change are same. When using <b>LPG</b> <b>and</b> dual-fuel, compared with burning gasoline, HC and NOx emission were reduced. 1...|$|R
