40|$|The Productivity Commission’s inquiry report, 'Review of Part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974 : International <b>Liner</b> <b>Cargo</b> Shipping', was {{released}} on 5 October 2005. The Commission was asked to examine and report on the rational, effects and alternatives to Part X, which allow international liner operators to cooperate and form conferences under the conditional exemptions from the Act. The Commission maintains that evaluation and selective registration of agreements is necessary if Australia is to be confident that only those that provided a net public benefit are allowed to operate. It maintained its preferred option for authorisation under Part X. Under this option, Part X would be repealed and the <b>liner</b> <b>cargo</b> shipping industry {{would be subject to}} the general provision of the Act. The Commission proposed four-year transitional arrangement. If Part X is not repealed, the Commission recommended improving current arrangements through either selective registration or excluding from registration ‘discussion agreements’.

50|$|Specialized {{types of}} cargo vessels include {{container}} ships and bulk carriers (technically tankers {{of all sizes}} are cargo ships, although they are routinely {{thought of as a}} separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are <b>cargo</b> <b>liners.</b> Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. <b>Cargo</b> <b>liners</b> run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some <b>cargo</b> <b>liners</b> may carry passengers also. A <b>cargo</b> <b>liner</b> that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line.|$|R

40|$|Inquiry into International <b>Liner</b> <b>Cargo</b> Shipping Please find {{enclosed}} a {{submission to}} above inquiry prepared by Meyrick & Associates Pty Ltd. We {{hope that it}} provide useful input to the inquiry. This submission was commissioned and funded by Liner Shipping Services Ltd (LSS), and we {{understand that it is}} referred to in the LSS submission. My personal views on the desirability of retaining Part X are reasonably well-known in the Australian liner shipping industry, and it is of course unlikely that LSS would funded the preparation of the submission if it had not anticipated that our submission would be broadly supportive of the position favoured by member lines. A reading of our submission will make it clear that this in fact the case. We would, however, like to make two things clear: • The views expressed in the submission are the sincerely held views of the authors, and result from many years reflection on the dynamics of liner shipping industry and on the economic literature regarding it. The commission from LSS has provided us with an opportunity to refine, update and articulate these views. It has not materially changed them • Although the structure of the submission was discussed with LSS, and LSS commented on a draft of it, LSS has not approved or endorsed it. The submission should therefore be taken to reflect the views of the authors only, not those of LSS. Yours faithfull...|$|E
40|$|From {{the advent}} of the {{containerization}} era, which transformed the conventional <b>liner</b> <b>cargo</b> vessels to cellular container ships, major changes have resulted as far as it concerns container ships sizes. The continuous will of shipping liner companies for further achievements of economies of scale and cost savings during the years, has led to the introduction of larger vessels. The result of this continuous tendency is the Ultra Large Container Ship being the size of 12, 500 TEU. This vessel although not yet in operation is expected to be operational {{at the end of the}} decade. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the impact of the ULCV on major container ports serving the W. Europe-Far East liner trade. Chapters Two and Three investigate the initiatives adopted by the selected top container ports of each region being Rotterdam and Hong Kong, along with the port of Amsterdam, so as to offer high service efficiency and economies of scale to the today's larger container ships. The later port is being investigated due to the existence of a new container terminal with an intended berth especially designed for larger container vessels. In Chapter four a conceptual model is developed to define the thesis problem more clearly along with its main variables. Within the conceptual model, the framework of the research and the relationships among several factors that have been identified as important to the problem, are demonstrated. Continuing at Chapter five, the methodology of the research and the hypotheses that are to be investigated, are included. The use of a questionnaire has formed the basic mean for gathering primary data from the port industry, in addition to the secondary data included at the previous chapters. Chapter six includes the analysis of the primary data results, and shows how several major ports intend to respond to the future operation of Ultra Large Container Vessels. In addition the results of the survey are used in order to test the hypotheses stated at chapter five. Finally for the purpose of clarity and clear presentation, the thesis includes an introduction along with a brief summary of the subject and limitations of the enquiry, the proposed methodology, the reasons for the choice of this subject, and the main aims/objectives of the enquiry. Moreover the thesis ends with a conclusion of the overall research and further actions, which are necessary to be undertaken, so as a more adequate examination of the problem to take place...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the circumstances and events accompanying the hoisting and {{usage of the}} cement stone blocks after {{the sinking of the}} motor sailing-boat Grisslan in the spring of 1924. They relate to navigation, hydro-technical construction and the Curion Spit bank reinforcement operations of that period. The article also reveals certain features of the work performed by Klaipėda port administration in relation to response to and registration of vessel sinking accidents. Customary and modernized (motor) sailing-boats dominated in the shipping of construction materials and other cargo from Sweden to Klaipėda port, whereas <b>liner</b> <b>cargo</b> shipping with Germany and Great Britain mainly employed motor vessels. Although the boat Grisslan had the displacement very similar to the displacement of most vessels arriving at Klaipėda port {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th c., this type of vessels – motor sailing boats – was already outdated and did not comply with the requirements of modern cargo shipping. Therefore the reasons of this sailing boat sinking accident can be regarded as symptomatic. The described shipping accident can be related to obvious changes in two areas of technical development: more intensive development (modernization) of shipping vessels and technologies between the two wars, and the use of Portland cement and concrete in hydro-technical and urban constructions. Sparse archive material, mundane and laconic press reports of those days show that specific work of divers, application of underwater explosions and breakwater concrete work technologies in Klaipėda port were routine procedures in port operations. The decisions to use barrel-shape cement stone blocks for the reinforcement of the southern edge of Klaipėda port breakwater and Kopgalis dune ridge is interesting and uncommon in technical history; on the other hand, the decision was sound and realistic, as boulders suitable for hydro technical construction were short in supply and the use of cement stone blocks was a good money saving opportunity for the port administration. Then again, such a decision proves that at that time there were no doubts concerning the durability of Portland cement in seawater environment and other performance characteristics. Good present condition of the cement stone blocks at Kopgalis has proven that this decision was viable.
