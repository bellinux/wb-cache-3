50|$|More {{than one}} million tons of steel is {{salvaged}} per year, {{and much of it}} is sold domestically. In the 2009-2010 fiscal year, a record 107 ships, with a combined <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> (LDT) of 852,022 tons, were broken at Gadani whereas in the previous 2008-2009 fiscal year, 86 ships, with a combined LDT of 778,598 tons, were turned into scrap.|$|E
50|$|Based on <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage,</b> Mistral and Tonnerre are {{the largest}} ships in the French Navy after the nuclear-powered {{aircraft}} carrier , for roughly the same height above water.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>displacement</b> or <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{of a ship}} is its weight, {{expressed}} in long tons of water its hull displaces. It is measured indirectly using Archimedes' principle by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship then converting that value into tons.|$|R

50|$|The <b>displacement</b> or <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{of a ship}} is the ship's weight. The name {{reflects}} {{the fact that it is}} measured indirectly, by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship, and then calculating the weight of that water. By Archimedes' principle, this is also the weight of the ship.|$|R
50|$|The {{detailed}} specifications for every ship are not {{released by the}} PLAN. They {{are thought to have}} a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of around 21,000 tons when fully loaded, with a crew of about 470 and a length of about 190 m. Their propulsion is from one Sulzer Ltd. diesel engine, with a top speed of 20 knots (37 km/h).|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common combat format across the {{different}} model warship clubs, team free-for-all involves the division of players present into two teams that are equal based upon a combat strength rubric (i.e. units in Fast Gun or a combination of <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> and cannon count in Big Gun), which then sortie against each other in accordance with the club's rules and scoring system.|$|R
50|$|Bolger and Altenberger {{expressed}} concern that existing governmental fishing permits issued based on length of the fishing boat, created an incentive to use inefficient wide and deep fishing boat hulls. If the fishing permits were issued based instead on <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the hull, then the incentive {{would be for the}} fishing industry to use long, narrow and shallow hulls which would be more economical to purchase and to operate per ton of fish caught.|$|R
50|$|Ultra <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> {{boats are}} {{designed}} to plane and thereby circumvent the limitations of hull speed.|$|R
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but unseaworthy ships. Zheng He {{would not have had}} the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of about 800 tons.|$|R
50|$|Underwood and Kable were {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} smaller vessels and sloops, but the 188-tonne fully rigged King George would be their most ambitious construction. The keel was laid down in 1804, and she was completed with an overall length of 87 feet, a beam of 22 feet 7 inches and a 14 feet hold. Her tonnage was computed at upwards of 200 tons. This was probably her burthen as she is mentioned by other sources as having a tonnage of 180 or 185 tons, which would seem to be her <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage.</b> Launched in April 1805, she completed fit-out and was registered in May 1805.|$|R

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} is centred upon building squadrons {{composed of}} individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. Each {{of the characters}} are moe anthropomorphisms of World War II naval warships which are depicted as cute girls, known as [...] "Fleet girls" [...] (kanmusu). These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities {{of each of the}} girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> are usually depicted as girls on their late teens to early twenties, while smaller ships look and behave like pubescent girls, with a few exceptions). The player takes on the role of an admiral (teitoku) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing. The player can organise up to four different fleets.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{well-known}} designer of sailing boats of all sizes, including the Cherub, Javelin (NZ), Firebug and Flying Ant classes of sailing dinghies. His designs used thin plywood, hard chines, a vertical stem and stern and <b>light</b> <b>displacement.</b> The minimum weight for a Cherub hull was 50 kg and a Firebug is 40 kg.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s saw Santa Cruz and {{the yacht}} club {{come to the}} {{forefront}} of the Ultra <b>Light</b> <b>Displacement</b> Boat (ULDB) movement that revolutionized yacht racing. In 1977 Bill Lee’s “Merlin” shattered the Trans Pacific Race record and Santa Cruz ULDBs of all sizes became the boats to beat. Merlin’s record stood for 20 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} sold for {{recycling}} in China in late 2009 for US$316 per ton, {{resulting in a}} scrap price of US$3.4 million for a ship with a <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> of 10,816 tons. In 2008 a double acting ship operated by Norilsk Nickel was named Monchegorsk after the SA-15 class freighter that had once supported the Norilsk-Dudinka operation.|$|R
50|$|The second boat, Magic (US-38), was {{designed}} by Johan Valentijn. Valentijn sought to build a small, <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> 12 metre and Magic was several feet shorter than Spirit of America and displaced a mere 45,000 pounds (20.4 metric tonnes) - about three-quarters of most contemporary 12 metres. Both Spirit of America and Magic were commissioned at Fort Schuyler, New York, on 17 April 1982.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Britain had been caused severe {{difficulty}} by the U-boat campaign in the First World War, the Admiralty completely ignored {{the threat of the}} submarine until the late 1930s. The Royal Navy had founded its traditional defensive strength on the battleship, which was used to defend its waters and merchant fleets. This weapon had proved incapable of countering U-boats during the war. The Admiralty also ignored the damage caused by submarines and regarded them as ineffective defensive weapons. Given the disarmament of Germany there seemed little offensive threat. Even after the rise of Adolf Hitler and the birth of the Third Reich, there seemed little inclination or will toward rearming Britain's ASW air forces. To the contrary, the Anglo-German Naval agreement signed in June 1935, allowed the Germans to build German U-boat strength to one-third the <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the entire Royal Navy. In fact, the Germans had been developing submarines as early as 1922, despite the Treaty of Versailles and the banning of German military submarines.|$|R

50|$|The yachts {{designed}} by Farr are primarily light-displacement, fractional rig, wide sterned, shallow hulled yachts. Many of Bruce Farr's early designs were comparatively skiff-like in appearance, with shallow hulls, wide sterns and <b>light</b> <b>displacement.</b> The {{result is a}} quicker, faster hull than more traditional racing yacht designs. Over the years more and more designers have incorporated these ideas. The latest Volvo Open 70 class yachts are examples of this trend.|$|R
50|$|The Soverel 33 {{is a high}} {{performance}} racing yacht, launched in 1983 by renowned racing sailor and designer Mark Soverel. It was primarily intended as a one-design fleet but, although approximately 90 boats were built, that never quite happened. The boat was a success as a racer and a forerunner to the modern sports boat with its <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> (5,300-5,900 lbs depending on builder), large sail area and open transom.|$|R
5000|$|The trireme was a fast attack, <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> vessel. In {{order to}} sustain the bending moments of her {{considerable}} length, a tightened rope (hypozomata) was mounted beneath the deck spanning from bow to stern. This was an ingenious way to increase rigidity of the hull. Today in modern construction it is called pre-tensioning. After every trip the triremes were pulled ashore in special slides and the hypozomata was re-tightened.|$|R
5000|$|USS Inca, a 3,381-ton (<b>light</b> <b>displacement)</b> [...] "Liberty" [...] ship, was {{launched}} in March 1943 at Los Angeles, California, and entered merchant service later the same month as S.S. William B. Allison, MCE hull 724. Two years later she would be taken into US Navy as stores ship and renamed USS Inca (IX-229). For much of her service as Inca she was also named USS Gamage (IX-227) because of bureaucratic confusion.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 Davidson {{designed}} Waverider for Tony Bouzaid, {{which won}} the 1978 Half Ton Cup held at Poole, England. In reaction {{to the success of}} the <b>light</b> <b>displacement</b> designed of Davidson, Bruce Farr and Paul Whiting, the IOR bought in new rules which required extensive surgery of Waverider to bring her into class for the 1979 Half Ton Cup series, which Waverider won, becoming the first yacht to ever win the Half Ton Cup twice.|$|R
