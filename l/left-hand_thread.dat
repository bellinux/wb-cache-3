5000|$|... 19-1 (1959): Change {{extractor}} rod, {{right to}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some Edison base {{lamps and}} {{fittings}} (such as those formerly {{used on the}} New York City Subway) have a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> to deter theft, since they cannot be used in other light fixtures.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an example}} of lateral thinking, Fraser-Smith used a special <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> for the {{disguised}} screw-off top of a hidden-document container; he suggested this would prevent discovery by the [...] "unswerving logic of the German mind", as no German would ever think of trying to unscrew something the wrong way.|$|E
50|$|Threads are {{normally}} right-hand. For <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads,</b> the letters, LH, are appended.|$|R
50|$|Most Edison screws have {{right-hand}} threads (lamp {{is turned}} clockwise to tighten), but <b>left-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> screws do exist, generally {{for use in}} special cases in which a specific voltage or wattage is required. This discourages using an incorrect bulb, which could result in an explosion or other incident. Locations such as railway trains and the New York City Subway have used light bulbs that have <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads</b> in order to discourage theft of the bulbs for use in regular light fixtures.|$|R
2500|$|Trapezoidal thread {{forms are}} screw thread {{profiles}} with trapezoidal outlines. They {{are the most}} common forms used for leadscrews (power screws). They offer high strength and ease of manufacture. They are typically found where large loads are required, as in a vise or the leadscrew of a lathe. Standardized variations include multiple-start <b>threads,</b> <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads,</b> and self-centering threads (which are less likely to bind under lateral forces).|$|R
50|$|The valves on industrial, {{medical and}} diving {{cylinders}} are usually {{of different sizes}} and types, as are the valves for different categories of gases, {{making it more difficult}} to mistakenly misuse a gas. For example, a hydrogen cylinder does not fit an oxygen supply line which would end in catastrophic failure. Some fittings use a right-hand thread, while others use a left-hand thread; <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> fittings are usually identifiable by notches or grooves cut into them.|$|E
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded eye bolts, one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both eye bolts to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the eye bolts or attached cables.|$|E
50|$|The {{kelly is}} the {{polygonal}} tubing and the kelly bushing is the mechanical device that turns the kelly when rotated by the rotary table. Together they {{are referred to}} as a kelly drive. The upper end of the kelly is screwed into the swivel, using a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> to preclude loosening from the right-hand torque applied below. The kelly typically is about 10 ft (3 m) longer than the drill pipe segments, thus leaving a portion of newly drilled hole open below the bit after a new length of pipe has been added ("making a connection") and the drill string has been lowered until the kelly bushing engages again in the rotary table.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the British Standards Institution {{sets the}} {{standards}}. Included among the standards {{is the use}} <b>left-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> valves for flammable gas cylinders (most commonly brass, BS4, valves for non corrosive cylinder contents or stainless steel, BS15, valves for corrosive contents). Non flammable gas cylinders are fitted with right-hand threaded valves (most commonly brass, BS3, valves for non corrosive components or stainless steel, BS14, valves for corrosive components).|$|R
50|$|To {{transfer}} power from all pedals {{to the rear}} wheel requires a drive train. Typically, the forward crankset is connected by a left-side timing chain to the rear crankset, {{which in turn is}} connected by a right-side chain to the rear wheel. This configuration is called crossover rear drive, and requires both of the rear cranks to have chainrings. To work reliably, both of the left-side cranks must be tandem- or left-drive specific to accept the <b>left-hand</b> <b>threading</b> used on left pedals.|$|R
25|$|The right-side (usually {{the chain}} side) hole is {{right-hand}} threaded, and the left-side hole is <b>left-hand</b> (reverse) <b>threaded</b> {{to help prevent}} it from becoming unthreaded by an effect called precession.|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} is the [...] "locking wheel nut", {{which is almost}} universally used for alloy wheels in the United Kingdom. One standard lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and unique key (typically a computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and remove the nut. This helps to discourage theft of wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which grip {{the head of the}} locking nut using a hardened <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread.</b> The success of these depends on whether there is room to use it in the lug hole, and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a free-spinning outer casing to the lock. Keeping an appropriate tool to lock and unlock aftermarket nuts, and a spare set of nuts, with the spare tire in the boot of the car is recommended by manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually <b>threaded,</b> often <b>left-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|R
5000|$|The spinner cap was {{introduced}} into the commercial vehicle and passenger automobile market in the 1930s. The spinner or [...] "knock-off" [...] was designed to keep the wheel on the automobile. They were screwed on and [...] "knocked on tightly" [...] using hammers and tools, hence the name [...] "knock-offs". Most setups will feature right-hand threads {{on the left side}} of the vehicle, and <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads</b> (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw-on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion. The knock-off spinners were used until the development of the lug nut method attaching the wheel.|$|R
50|$|Hutton made {{compasses}} {{that were}} hidden inside pens or tunic buttons. He used <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads</b> so that, if the Germans discovered {{them and the}} searcher tried to screw them open, they would just tighten. He printed maps on silk, so they would not rustle, and disguised them as handkerchiefs, hiding them inside canned goods. For aircrew he designed special boots with detachable leggings that could quickly be converted to look like civilian shoes, and hollow heels that contained packets of dried food. Some of the spare uniforms that were sent to prisoners could be easily converted into civilian suits. Officer prisoners inside Colditz Castle requested and received a complete floor plan of the castle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around the screw with your thumb pointing is the direction you want the screw to go. If the screw is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn the screw {{in the direction of}} your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your thumb. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
50|$|The AKM’s barrel is {{installed}} in the forward trunnion and pinned (as opposed to the AK-47, which has a one piece receiver with integral trunnions and a barrel that is screwed-in). Additionally the barrel has horizontal guide slots that help align and secure the handguards in place. To increase the weapon’s accuracy during automatic fire, the AKM was fitted with a slant cut muzzle brake that helps redirect expanding propellant gases upward {{and to the right}} during firing, which mitigates the rise of the muzzle during an automatic burst when held by a right-handed firer. The muzzle brake is threaded on {{to the end of the}} barrel with a <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread.</b> Not all AKMs had slant muzzle brakes; some were also fitted with the older muzzle nut which came from the AK-47. Most AKMs with muzzle nuts were older production weapons. The AKM's slant brake can also be used on the AK-47, which had a simple nut to cover the threads.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the fatigue resistance of friction stir welded (FSWed) AZ 31 B-H 24 Mg alloy butt joints with emphasis on the effect of pin tool thread orientation (right-hand thread (RHT) and <b>left-hand</b> <b>thread</b> (LHT)) in the clockwise rotation. The friction stir welding resulted in recrystallized grains in the stir zone (SZ) and thermomechanicallyaffected zone (TMAZ), and partially recrystallized grains in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), with the lowest hardness appeared in the SZ. The fatigue life after friction stir welding was observed to be lower at high stress amplitudes, but remained nearly the same at low stress amplitudes. Fatigue strength was higher in the FSWed joints made with the LHT pin tool than with the RHT pin tool due to the elimination of the welding defects near the bottom surface via a downward material flow. Fatigue fracture basically occurred at or near the boundary between TMAZ and SZ. Fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface or near surface defects in the case of LHT pin tool, and from the welding defects near the bottom surface in the case of RHT pin tool. Crack propagation was characterized by the formation of fatigue striations...|$|E
50|$|Most (except for Italian and French) designs use {{right-hand}} (normal) threading for {{the left}} side and <b>left-hand</b> (reverse) <b>threading</b> for the right (drive) side. This is opposite of most pedal threading and is done for the same reason: to keep the bottom bracket cup from backing out of the bottom bracket shell due to precession.|$|R
5000|$|The USP Tactical (9mm Parabellum, [...]40 S&W, [...]45 ACP) {{incorporates}} a fully adjustable rear sight, a higher-profile front sight (as {{to be visible}} above the suppressor), an extended threaded barrel and O-ring, a match grade trigger, and an adjustable trigger stop (the 9mm model, referred to by HK as the [...] "USP9SD (tactical)" [...] {{does not have the}} match trigger with adjustable trigger stop, O-ring, and does not carry the [...] "Tactical" [...] marking on the slide that the USP40 and USP45 Tactical models do, making it essentially a full size USP9 with threaded barrel and raised & adjustable target sights, but those features were added to it in 2015). Sound suppressors designed for the USP Tactical are available from Brügger & Thomet and Knight's Armament. A unique feature of the USP Tactical is that the barrel is <b>left-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> (counter-clockwise to tighten), which makes the pistol incompatible with suppressors designed for the MK23 Mod 0.|$|R
50|$|The bicycle {{business}} of the Wright brothers, the Wright Cycle Company (originally the Wright Cycle Exchange) successively occupied five different locations in Dayton, Ohio. Orville and Wilbur Wright began their bicycle repair, rental and sales business in 1892, while continuing to operate a print shop (they ended their local newspaper business in 1890). In 1896 they began manufacturing and selling bicycles of their own design, the Van Cleve and St. Claire, named after their ancestors. They invented the self-oiling hub and the innovation of machining the crankarm and pedal {{on the left side}} of the bike with <b>left-hand</b> <b>threads</b> to prevent the pedal from coming unscrewed while cycling. The brick building at 22 South Williams St., where the Wrights worked from 1895 to 1897, is the only extant building on its original foundation and in its original location that housed a Wright bicycle shop. They ran their printing shop on the second-floor. The 22 South Williams Street building is part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and the National Aviation Heritage Area.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, locking nuts (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of nuts. Only one locking nut per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a <b>left-hand</b> self-cutting <b>thread</b> to grip the locking nut, although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{direction}} and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction {{is from the}} point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a <b>left-hand</b> screw <b>thread.</b> Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.|$|R
40|$|Linear back-drive {{differentials}} {{have been}} proposed as alternatives to conventional gear differentials for applications {{in which there is}} only limited rotational motion (e. g., oscillation). The finite nature of the rotation makes it possible to optimize a linear back-drive differential in ways that would not be possible for gear differentials or other differentials that are required to be capable of unlimited rotation. As a result, relative to gear differentials, linear back-drive differentials could be more compact and less massive, could contain fewer complex parts, and could be less sensitive to variations in the viscosities of lubricants. Linear back-drive differentials would operate according to established principles of power ball screws and linear-motion drives, but would utilize these principles in an innovative way. One major characteristic of such mechanisms that would be exploited in linear back-drive differentials is the possibility of designing them to drive or back-drive with similar efficiency and energy input: in other words, such a mechanism can be designed so that a rotating screw can drive a nut linearly or the linear motion of the nut can cause the screw to rotate. A linear back-drive differential (see figure) would include two collinear shafts connected to two parts that are intended to engage in limited opposing rotations. The linear back-drive differential would also include a nut that would be free to translate along its axis but not to rotate. The inner surface of the nut would be right-hand threaded at one end and <b>left-hand</b> <b>threaded</b> at the opposite end to engage corresponding right- and left-handed threads on the shafts. A rotation and torque introduced into the system via one shaft would drive the nut in linear motion. The nut, in turn, would back-drive the other shaft, creating a reaction torque. Balls would reduce friction, making it possible for the shaft/nut coupling on each side to operate with 90 percent efficiency...|$|R
50|$|The pedal spindle is {{threaded}} to match a threaded {{hole at the}} outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 in hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a 1/2 in by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 x 1.25 (14 mm metric diameter with 1.25 mm pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole.The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right-hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is <b>left-hand</b> (reverse) <b>threaded</b> to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession.Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a right-hand thread), the force from the rider's foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise {{with respect to the}} crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction and thus would loosen a right-hand thread.For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a 1 in by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger single bearing, as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.|$|R
40|$|We aim at {{investigating}} the morphology, kinematic and helicity {{evolution of a}} loop-like prominence during its eruption. We use multi-instrument observations from AIA/SDO, EUVI/STEREO and LASCO/SoHO. The kinematic, morphological, geometrical, and helicity evolution of a loop-like eruptive prominence are studied {{in the context of}} the magnetic flux rope model of solar prominences. The prominence eruption evolved as a height expanding twisted loop with both legs anchored in the chromosphere of a plage area. The eruption process consists of a prominence activation, acceleration, and a phase of constant velocity. The prominence body was composed of <b>left-hand</b> (counter-clockwise) twisted <b>threads</b> around the main prominence axis. The twist during the eruption was estimated at 6 pi (3 turns). The prominence reached a maximum height of 526 Mm before contracting to its primary location and partially reformed in the same place two days after the eruption. This ejection, however, triggered a CME seen in LASCO C 2. The prominence was located in the northern periphery of the CME magnetic field configuration and, therefore, the background magnetic field was asymmetric with respect to the filament position. The physical conditions of the falling plasma blobs were analysed with respect to the prominence kinematics. The same sign of the prominence body twist and writhe, as well as the amount of twisting above the critical value of 2 pi after the activation phase indicate that possibly conditions for kink instability were present. No signature of magnetic reconnection was observed anywhere in the prominence body and its surroundings. The filament/prominence descent following the eruption and its partial reformation at the same place two days later suggest a confined type of eruption. The asymmetric background magnetic field possibly played an important role in the failed eruption. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, in press in A&...|$|R
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at the shutter setting B and is only settable after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the <b>left-hand</b> front located <b>threaded</b> shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|R
