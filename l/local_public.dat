40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{political}} participation of <b>local</b> <b>publics</b> in the unemployment field, examining networks of collective actors in Lyon and Turin. Our main question is: Is the participation of <b>local</b> <b>publics</b> fostered under conditions of more developed governance that increases bottom-up access (formal or informal) to elites and institutions in the policy domain? Drawing upon the most recent developments in literatures on social movement theory, governance, and network analysis, this article discusses the main variations in terms of political participation of <b>local</b> <b>publics</b> in Lyon and Turin. It then enquires into the main explanatory factors accounting for these variations, thus showing that the openness of governance does influence the level of political participation of <b>local</b> <b>publics.</b> The main argument is that in an open context participation is low, while in a closed (or underdeveloped) context <b>local</b> <b>publics</b> participate more, with differential access to decision-making according to their resources...|$|R
