50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{method of}} the controller design for one <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> with parametric uncertainty. Recently, many manufacturing robots are operated in manufacturing facilities, {{with the aim}} of labor and cost saving or improvement of the productivity. Such robots need to have positioning performance of high precision. In condition that there is an uncertainty in plant dynamics, desired control performance may not be attained because the controller is designed according to the mathematical model of a plant. So {{it is important that the}} designed control system have a robust control performance. In this paper, the robust controller is designed using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) for one <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> with parametric uncertainty. Simulation experiments are run for control system designed by using QFT and conventional method. The results are compared with each other and it is found that the control system designed by QFT shows a robust performance and can suppress the unevenness of output against parametric uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Being hyper-redundant, modularized and {{continuously}} driving, link-type robots {{have high}} mobility under unstructured environment as the nature snake does. In this study, we have experimented {{on the nature}} snake and analyzed the link-type structure&# 39;s character in detail, {{and then we have}} proposed a novel link-type shape shifting modular robot. The key advantage of this design over other link-type vehicle is their adaptability and flexibility for its various configurations. Robot in such link type can change its configuration to adapt to the environment and mission by reconfiguring and shape shifting. A standard module is mainly composed of a <b>link</b> <b>arm,</b> a link handle, an offset Pitch joint, an offset Yaw joint, and the track driven system. The adjacent modules are connected through the <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> and the link handle. The multi-module robot can change it shape by the motion of the offset joints. After modification of the standard module, a two-module robot and a three-module robot&# 39;s assembled structure have been designed respectively. After planning of their locomotion configuration, locomotion experiments of these two robots have been made on the slope, over the trench, up the stairs and on the debris. Experiments have demonstrated that such kind structure permits good mobility and high flexibility under unstructured environment. Being simple, small and portable, the tracked robot platform series have been developed for potential application such as Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) efforts, and planetary exploration...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the kinematics and/or dynamics of a high-DOF robotic manipulator to a low-dimension “task space” {{has proven to be}} an invaluable tool for designing feedback controllers. When obstacles or other kinodynamic constraints complicate the feedback design process, motion planning techniques can often still find feasible paths, but these techniques are typically implemented in the high-dimensional configuration (or state) space. Here we argue that providing a Voronoi bias in the task space can dramatically improve the performance of randomized motion planners, while still avoiding non-trivial constraints in the configuration (or state) space. We demonstrate the potential of task-space search by planning collision-free trajectories for a 1500 <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> through obstacles to reach a desired end-effector position...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{have been}} {{exploring}} {{the use of}} passive robotic mechanisms for the display of virtual surfaces. Cobots are one way of producing virtual surfaces using a passive mechanism. Unlike powered robots, the nonlinear dynamics of the passive mechanism (e. g., an arm) can be felt by the user as a spatially varying apparent inertia. This effect occurs in many passive designs, including {{but not limited to}} cobots. We explain the variable apparent inertia as the projection of the spatially-varying inertia matrix onto the direction of motion, and discuss several ways to control the apparent inertia. We explore apparent inertia in detail for the unicycle two <b>link</b> <b>arm,</b> a cobot we have developed for experiments in single-arm motor control studies and rehabilitation. Special paths ("iso-mass contours") are found for this mechanism along which the apparent inertia is constant.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{repetitive}} {{control scheme}} is presented and discussed, {{based on the}} so called B-spline filters. This type of dynamic filters are able to provide a Bspline trajectory if they are fed with the sequence of proper control points that define the trajectory itself. Therefore, they are ideal tools for generating online the reference signal with the prescribed level of smoothness for driving dynamic systems, e. g. with a feedforward compensator. In particular, the so-called Continuous Zero Phase Error Tracking Controller (ZPETC) {{can be used for}} tracking control of non-minimum phase systems but because of its open-loop nature cannot guarantee robustness with respect to modelling errors and exogenous disturbances. For this reason, ZPETC and trajectory generator have been embedded in a repetitive control scheme that allows to nullify interpolation errors even in non-ideal conditions, provided that the desired reference trajectory and the disturbances are periodic. The asymptotic stability of the overall control scheme has been proved and its performances have been demonstrated by considering a well-known non-minimum phase plant, i. e. a flexible <b>link</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} performance of a novel joint based actuator for a robot run by variable stiffness actuation, meant for systems physically interacting with humans. This new actuator prototype (VSA-II) is developed as an improvement over our previously developed one reported in [9], where an optimal mechanical-control co-design principle established in [7] is followed as well. While the first version was built {{in a way to}} demonstrate effectiveness of variable impedance actuation (VIA), it had limitations in torque capacities, life cycle and implementability in a real robot. VSA-II overcomes the problem of implementability with higher capacities and robustness in design for longer life. The paper discusses design and stiffness behaviour of VSA-II in theory and experiments. A comparison of stiffness characteristics between the two actuator is discussed, highlighting the advantages of the new design. A simple, but effective PD scheme is employed to independently control joint-stiffness and joint-position of a 1 -link arm. Finally, results from performed impact tests of 1 - <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> are reported, showing the effectiveness of stiffness variation in controlling value of a safety metric...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design {{automatic}} and accurate control systems for wheel speed and steering of an agricultural mobile robot. Three controllers, including lead-lag compensator, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic controller were designed and simulated in this study to control the angular rate of the shaft of a DC motor actuator for a field survey mobile robot that moves between plants rows to perform image acquisition task through a digital camera mounted on a two <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> attached on the robot base. The response of the actuator model for each controller were determined and compared for a sinusoidal and a step input that simulated robot speed and positioning references respectively. Performance analysis showed the effectiveness of the PID and lead-lag compensator response for the wheel steering task, while the fuzzy logic controller design had a better performance in wheel speed control. The output of this analysis was a proved satisfaction of the proposed design criteria which results enhanced mobility of the robot in terms of fast response, speed control accuracy and smooth steering at row-end turnings...|$|E
40|$|Many {{applications}} of robotic and teleoperated manipulator arms require operation in contact and non-contact regimes. This paper deals with both regimes and the transition between them with special {{attention given to}} problems of flexibility in the links and drives. This {{is referred to as}} contact control. Inverse dynamics is used to plan the tip motion of the flexible link so that the free motion can stop very near the contact surface without collision due to overshoot. Contact must occur at a very low speed since the high frequency impact forces are too sudden to be affected by any feedback generated torques applied to a joint {{at the other end of}} the link. The effect of approach velocity and surface properties are discussed. Force tracking is implemented by commands to the deflection states of the link and the contact force. This enables a natural transition between tip position and tip force control that is not possible when the arm is treated as rigid. The effect of feedback gain, force trajectory, and desired final force are of particular interest and are studied. Experimental results are presented on a one <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> and the system performance in the overall contact task is analyzed. Extension to multi-link cases with potential applications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A bi-axial direct mounted strain gauged {{lower links}} {{system for the}} {{measurement}} of tractor-implement forces was designed and calibrated for coincident and perpendicular loads up to 10 kN. No lateral force or moment was considered. The system was tested for its Sensitivity, Cross-Sensitivity, Hysteresis, Linearity and Repeatability. The results of the calibration tests revealed that the system was well working {{for a range of}} draught and vertical forces up to 20 kN. The results showed a high degree of linearity between bridge output voltage and force applied. The minimum co-efficient of correlation, R 2, was found to be 0. 9996. The hysteresis effect between the calibration curves for increasing and decreasing applied coincident and perpendicular force was very small (< 1. 20 %). The interactions of the applied forces on the orthogonal force bridges were less than one percent. Maximum difference from the mean value for applied coincident and perpendicular force respectively was 1. 75 % and 1. 3 %. If the lower <b>link</b> <b>arm</b> 793 / 1 is considered as an example, the sensitivity for coincident and perpendicular force respectively was found to be 1. 28 x 10 - 4 µVN- 1 V- 1 and 6. 80 x 10 - 4 µVN- 1 V- 1.
