In this case HR-CS AAS is offering the possibility to measure correction spectra of the molecule(s) that is (are) responsible for the background and store them in the computer. These spectra are then multiplied with a factor to match the intensity of the sample spectrum and subtracted pixel by pixel and spectrum by spectrum from the sample spectrum using a least-squares algorithm. This might sound complex, but first of all the number of di-atomic molecules that can exist at the temperatures of the atomizers used in AAS is relatively small, and second, the correction is performed by the computer within a few seconds. The same algorithm can actually also be used to correct for direct <b>line</b> <b>overlap</b> of two atomic absorption lines, making HR-CS AAS the only AAS technique that can correct for this kind of spectral interference.|$|E

Nevertheless, for complex {{problems such as}} <b>line</b> <b>overlap</b> in molecules showing hyperfine structure, a detailed analysis still requires {{a large amount of}} computing time and thus, misinterpretation cannot be dismissed due to an undersampling of the whole space of parameters. We extend the discussion of the implementation of the Gauss [...] Seidel algorithm in spherical geometry and include the case of hyperfine <b>line</b> <b>overlap.</b> We first review the basics of the short characteristics method that is used to solve the radiative transfer equations. Details are given on the determination of the Lambda operator in spherical geometry. The Gauss [...] Seidel algorithm is then described and, by analogy to the plan [...] parallel case, we see how to introduce it in spherical geometry. Doing so requires some approximations {{in order to keep the}} algorithm competitive. Finally, <b>line</b> <b>overlap</b> effects are included. The convergence speed of the algorithm is compared to the usual Jacobi iterative schemes.

40|$|OH megamasers (OHMs) emit {{primarily}} in the main lines at 1667 and 1665 MHz, and differ from their Galactic counterparts due to their immense luminosities, large linewidths and 1667 / 1665 MHz flux ratios, which are always greater than one. We find that these maser properties result from strong 53 µm radiative pumping combined with <b>line</b> <b>overlap</b> effects caused by turbulent linewidths ∼ 20 kms − 1; pumping calculations that do not include <b>line</b> <b>overlap</b> are unreliable. A minimum dust temperature of ∼ 45 K is needed for inversion, and maximum maser efficiency occurs for dust temperatures ∼ 80 – 140 K. We find that warmer dust can support inversion at lower IR luminosities, in agreement with observations. Our results are in good agreement with a clumpy model of OHMs, with clouds sizes � 1 pc and OH column densities ∼ 5 × 10 16 cm − 2, that is able to explain both the diffuse and compact emission observed for OHMs. We suggest that all OH main line masers may be pumped by far-IR radiation, with the major differences between OHMs and Galactic OH masers caused by differences in linewidth produced by <b>line</b> <b>overlap.</b> Small Galactic maser linewidths tend to produce stronger 1665 MHz emission. The large OHM linewidths lead to inverted ground state transitions having approximately the same excitation temperature, producing 1667 / 1665 MHz flux ratios greater than one and weak satellite line emission. Finally, the small observed ratio of pumping radiation to dense molecular gas, as traced by HCN and HCO +, is a possible reason {{for the lack of}} OH megamaser emission in NGC 6240.

In addition to the well known Class I and Class II maser lines, we found two new transitions which possibly may show up as strong masers.
