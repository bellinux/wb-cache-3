500|$|Eurogamer {{praised the}} {{involvement}} of people from The Simpsons television series with the game's development and GameZone enjoyed the two-character mechanics {{of the game and}} had fun collecting unlockable items.

[...] "The clothing {{in the movie}} is incredible, for both {{the men and the}} women. Eddie <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> Robin and Halle <b>look</b> <b>great.</b> Great hair, great makeup work for all concerned, cause we wanted it to look fantastic.

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the trial, Hendrix had his hair cut, and he purchased new clothes. One of his defense lawyers, Bob Levine, commented: [...] "I {{took him to a}} number of stores that specialized in tailored suits. We found a conservative suit that <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> on him. It was hilarious. He was like a hick, awkwardly fidgeting around and trying to loosen his tie. I didn't care how uncomfortable he was; the suit was perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{felt that}} the touch screen-based {{controls}} were not ideal for the fast pace of the gameplay. Schreier found the touch controls to be [...] "just fine", but thought that the game would work better with a D-pad and buttons. He praised the presentation, saying that the music was [...] "superb" [...] and that the game <b>looked</b> <b>great.</b> Slater thought that the game's look was impressive and that the music was excellent. Musgrave called the music [...] "outstanding", and found the monster characters to look fantastic, having benefited greatly from the updated 3D graphics; he was less sure about the art direction for the human characters, but still thought that they looked better {{than they did in}} Sword of Mana.|$|E
500|$|Futterman called [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] the [...] "best {{number of}} the night". She added that it [...] "mixes slick dance moves and spot-on singing with perhaps a touch too much sexual tension for a student/teacher pairing".

Both Chaney and Lynch noted what she called [...] "inexplicably high production values"; the fact that [...] "these two <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> together", danced the merengue [...] "beautifully" [...] and [...] "sounded smooth" [...] drew a [...] "B+" [...] grade from her, while his [...] "B" [...] was given because [...] "the dancing wowed but their voices just didn't connect for me on this empty club version".|$|E

500|$|Sinclair envisaged {{producing}} follow-up vehicles {{such as the}} C10, a two-seater city car, and the C15, a four-seater {{capable of}} travelling at [...] As Wills put it at the launch event, [...] "We're developing a family of traffic-compatible, quiet, economic and pollution-free vehicles {{for the end of}} the '80s." [...] The C5 was described as [...] "the baby of the family". The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to [...] in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, [...] "it <b>looked</b> <b>great.</b> I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too." [...] The design is strikingly similar to the modern Renault Twizy electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that [...] "you could put the C10 into production today and it would still look contemporary." ...|$|E
500|$|Goergen {{found the}} sound design unmemorable, {{saying that the}} music does not add much and that players {{would be likely to}} mute the game after hearing the [...] "beeping" [...] sound effect used for {{dialogue}} for too long. Meanwhile, Ponce and Petit liked it: Ponce called the score [...] "masterful" [...] and said that it [...] "gets under your skin at the right moments", while Petit said that she appreciated the sound, which she called atmospheric and [...] " [...] shivers up your spine". She was unimpressed with the environments, but said that they were clear and easy to look at. She liked the character portraits, calling them expressive and, paired with the dialogue, enough to make the player not care about the lack of voice acting. Ponce, too, felt that the game did not need voice acting. He felt that the way the game favored textual narration over animated cutscenes made it more immersive, allowing the player to imagine the scenes. Goergen said that the graphics were well done, but that they did not do much for the atmosphere. Kaplan called the presentation [...] "awesome", saying that it <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> and that the artwork stood on its own despite the simplicity of the animations, and that the soundtrack was [...] "fantastic".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has been}} married four times. In 1961, she married Jerry Smith, a ferroanalyst at the Inter-Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly, Ohio. They had one child {{together}} on March 9, 1963, named Darren Justin. (In the late 1970s, Darren went to Europe to become a missionary; he is currently a psychologist.) In the mid-1960s, the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band, Jack Watkins. They had a son, Kerry Watkins, before separating nearly a year after marrying. Shortly afterward, Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes. In the early 1970s, Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show. The couple had three daughters: Jeanne, Julie, and Jodi Haynes. After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s, Smith stated {{that she would never}} marry again, but on July 8, 1997 Smith married country artist Marty Stuart. They met while writing songs for Smith's 1998 comeback album. Twenty-six years before, Stuart had first encountered her after attending her concert: [...] "I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown to work at a fair. She hasn't changed a bit. She <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> then and she looks great now." [...] Smith accounts for the fact they have sustained their marriage as follows: [...] "Make the Lord the center … and commit." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{three years}} of study with Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio, Charles Grodin told Wilder about Lee Strasberg's method acting. Grodin persuaded {{him to leave the}} studio and begin {{studying}} with Strasberg in his private class. Several months later, Wilder was accepted into the Actors Studio. Feeling that [...] "Jerry Silberman in Macbeth" [...] did not have the right ring to it, he adopted a stage name. He chose [...] "Wilder" [...] because it reminded him of Our Town author Thornton Wilder, while [...] "Gene" [...] came from Thomas Wolfe's first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. He also liked [...] "Gene" [...] because as a boy, he was impressed by a distant relative, a World War II bomber navigator who was [...] "handsome and <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in his leather flight jacket." [...] He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing Macbeth, either. After joining the Actors Studio, he slowly began to be noticed in the off-Broadway scene, thanks to performances in Sir Arnold Wesker's Roots and in Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover, for which Wilder received the Clarence Derwent Award for [...] "Best Performance by an Actor in a Nonfeatured Role." [...] One of Wilder's early stage credits was playing the socially awkward mental patient Billy Bibbit in the original 1963-64 Broadway adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest opposite star Kirk Douglas.|$|E
500|$|... "Society Hill" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{questioned whether}} in real life, medical examiners [...] "do this much investigation on case", but then further saying, [...] "I always assumed that detectives did the field work {{but if that}} were the case on Body of Proof then I suppose we wouldn't have much of a show". She praised Neal Bledsoe's portrayal of Stephen Burkett, saying that he did a [...] "wonderful job of playing a chronic hair puller". She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. I was happy to see Bud jump in and read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment". Michelle Carlbert from TV Equals praised the scene in which Megan pulls Colin's hair, calling it one of her [...] "favourite bits", another being when it showed Ethan, Peter, Curtis and Bud going out on a [...] "Boy’s Night" [...] stating it was [...] "awesome" [...] and that she [...] "love(s) it when they show the team bonding like that". She also commented on Megan and Peter's clothes, stating that [...] "Megan <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in her dress" [...] and Peter in a tux was [...] "whoa".|$|E
500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she <b>looked</b> <b>great.</b> [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

[...] When development of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge was first assumed by FASA Studio, it was conceived that the game be made into an [...] "interactive movie," [...] a concept that would have involved an elaborate storyline {{and a large number}} of cutscenes. [...] This process would have needed a linear mission design, potentially restricting gameplay.

Jackson had a weak pulse, and his body was still warm. Murray tried to revive Jackson for five to 10 minutes, at which point he realized he needed to call for help. Murray stated that he was hindered because there was no landline in the house. Murray also stated that he could not use his cell phone to call 911 because he did not know the exact address. Murray stated that he also phoned security, but did not get any answer. Finally, Murray ran downstairs, yelled for help, and told a chef to bring security up to the room. By the time security called 911, Murray's lawyer stated that at least 30 minutes had passed.|$|E

40|$|People often {{joke about}} the {{certainty}} of death and taxes. Astronomers can add another certainty to that short list: Sooner or later someone will ask, “What {{do you think about}} the possibility of life out there?” Most questioners are looking for a particular answer. Science fiction novels, The Planetary Society, and countless movies, from E. T. to Contact to Planet of the Apes, suggest that extraterrestrial life is a given and help conjure images of how that life looks. To answer questions about such life takes as much diplomacy as answering my wife when she asks, “How do I look?” Experience suggests a strategy for handling both questions. Step one: Make a positive statement, such as “You <b>look</b> <b>great!</b> ” or “That’s a great question! ” Step two: Provide amplification. This part is trickier. It can make or break the interaction. If it lacks sincerity or includes the word but, (e. g., “You <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> but I thought you were going to wear the blue dress”), my wife may walk away feeling hurt and deflated. A better answer adds some specific feedback (e. g., “You <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> and I especially like the way that color goes with your eyes”) ...|$|R

2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team <b>looked</b> <b>great</b> in some games and sour in others.
