The aim of the work was to study early stage fatigue damage at high temperature by the observations of the characteristic surface relief evolution and crystallographic characterization changes by EBSD. The detail of slip bands shape was checked by FIB and AFM microscopes. The LCF test was conducted on GATAN stage with pre tilted position and constant stress amplitude of total cycle number of 20. The relief produced in the first cycle determines the other locations of the localized cyclic slip to the primary slip planes (111). The relief was modified in the next cycles but without forming additionally new slip traces in the primary system. Based on EBSD analysis before and after LCF, the orientation of two grains was changed which caused activation of second slip system.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a mechanism based approach for lifetime prediction of welded joints, {{subjected to a}} multiaxial non- proportional loading.

The primary objective of the research is the further development of simulation methods applied in safety evaluations of nuclear power plant components. In this context the modeling of crack initiation and growth inside the material structure induced by varying thermal loads are of particular interest. Therefore, three scientific working groups organized in three sub-projects of the joint research project are dealing with numerical modeling and simulation at different levels ranging from atomistic to micromechanics and continuum mechanics, and in addition corresponding experimental data for the validation of the numerical results and identification of the parameters of the associated material models are provided. The present contribution is focused on the development and experimental validation of material models and methods to characterize the damage evolution and the life cycle assessment as a result of thermal cyclic loading.

40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} {{mechanical}} properties of discontinuously reinforced metal matrix composites, DMMCs, {{in general and}} their fatigue properties in particular. Methods of manufacture, microstructures and resulting mechanical properties of DMMCs are reviewed in the introductory part. The incorporation of short ceramic fibres or particles in light alloys renders composites that are stiffer, stronger and in some respects more fatigue resistant than their parent matrix alloys. However, these beneficial effects {{have to be paid}} for by a reduction in toughness. Theories proposed for the explanation of these experimental observations are discussed. The appended papers deal with the fatigue crack growth characteristics and the <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> properties of composites based on the AA 6061 -alloy containing 15 vol. % SiC-particles or 20 vol. % Saffil- (Al 2 O 3) fibres. The processing of the particulate composite involved casting and extrusion whilst the Saffil composite was made by squeeze-casting. AA 6061 -matrix alloys in wrought and squeeze-cast conditions are included as well. The fatigue crack growth experiments showed that the composites are markedly superior to the matrix alloys in the threshold region: a more than 50 % increase of DKth over the matrix alloys was measured. This increase is partly due to increased crack closure of the composites, resulting i. a. from increased elastic modulus. Quantitative fractographic measurements allowed for a coupling of the altered fatigue crack growth resistance to changes in the appearance of fatigue fracture surfaces, induced by particles and fibres. The importance of crack topography, elastic modulus and crack branching for the net driving force for fatigue crack growth was quantified. Reduced crack tip opening displacement in the SiCp-composite, compared with the wrought matrix alloy, was indirectly measured. This promotes further reduction in crack growth rate, in addition to what is obtained from enhanced surface roughness and elastic modulus. <b>Low</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> experiments, <b>LCF,</b> were performed on the two composites and the cast matrix alloy. The SiCp-composite showed the largest tolerance against cycling at smaller plastic strains, while the matrix alloy was superior at higher plastic strain ranges. A systematic study of surface crack initiation and growth during LCF demonstrated that crack initiation from fractured large fibres or particles is instantaneous (Saffil composite) or almost instantaneous (SiCp-composite). A 3 D FEM-simulation demonstrated that the locally inhomogeneous state of stresses and strains in and around a stiff particle is enhanced, when the particle intersects a free surface compared to when the particle is entirely contained in the matrix. It was observed that the growth properties of individual microcracks determine the LCF-life in the composites. The growth rates of such cracks were an order of magnitude faster than those of long through cracks, at corresponding values of the growth parameter DJ...|$|R

An extended life time of the railway rails is desired. The high cyclic loads could cause material fracture and a catastrophic failure can occur. The material studied in this master thesis is cast austenitic manganese steel - Mn 13, Explosion Depth Hardened - EDH. Due to the high wear resistance and hardening during use the material can be applied in railway components. The project was cooperation between Chalmers University of Technology and the Austrian company VAE GmbH. The Mn 13 EDH steel investigated was the third material in the MU 16 CHARMEC-project. The specimens were provided by VAE GmbH. Tensile, fatigue and hardness tests were performed to examine the mechanical properties and the microstructure of the Mn 13 -steel was characterised using optical microscopy. Tensile testing was done at three different temperatures (+ 20 °C, + 100 °C and - 60 °C) and with two different strain rates (10 - 4 s- 1 and 10 - 1 s- 1) {{to determine the effects}} of deformation speed and temperature.
