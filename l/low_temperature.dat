5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E

The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour.

Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, heat {{conductivity}} in nonmetals is mainly due to lattice vibrations (phonons).

Thus, the thermal conductivity of nonmetals is approximately constant at high <b>temperatures.</b> At <b>low</b> <b>temperatures</b> well below the Debye temperature, thermal conductivity decreases, as does the heat capacity, due to carrier scattering from defects at very <b>low</b> <b>temperatures.</b>|$|R

However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.|$|E

5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E
