This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues.

50|$|The film is set post {{independence}} & a new <b>land</b> <b>sealing</b> law is {{drafted by}} Govt, {{which states that}} individuals cannot own land beyond a certain limit. This is a big blow to the Thakurs, since they owe 100s of acres of land. As per new law they would have surrender the excess land to govt, which would be distributed to the farmers. The Bade Thakur & his eldest son Deven cannot {{come to terms with}} this new change. Deven plans a plot, in which he will distribute the land amongst their relatives by back dating the transaction dates. For this they would need signature / thumb impression of the farmers who are tilling the land (the land is mortgaged to the Thakurs).

30|$|Yet, {{flooding}} {{risks are}} not limited to inland waters but also occur at open waters as a result of weather phenomena such as Hurricane Matthew in the Western Atlantic (2016) or the tsunami in Japan in 2011, which also led to a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima plant. While the private, non-material loss can hardly be quantified, flooding events cause substantial costs amounting to billions, such as hurricane Katrina in the US (2005) which killed more than 1800 people and caused damage of over 80 billion US$. These numbers clearly emphasize the importance for the development of flood protection and flood management tools. Due to human intervention, like river regulations and <b>land</b> <b>sealing,</b> as well as an increasing dense settlement in flood-prone regions, the need for research in this field is also underlined.|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{entitled}} "˙Evaluation of motorway's spatial {{impact in}} context of agricultural land protection" stresses {{the issues of}} agricultural <b>land</b> <b>sealing,</b> which failed to be reduced despite the relevant legislation. The thesis that for investigates the reasons for continuous sealing of the agricultural land in inappropriate methodology of spatial assessments (scenarios, environmental assessment), which evaluate the impact of spatial interventions on the agricultural land. Detailed overview of the methodology for spatial impact assessment on the agricultural land revealed that the existing method leans on quasi-quantitative estimations {{with a high degree}} of subjective evaluation. The method of impact evaluation for agricultural land was therefore recognized as less appropriate and more affective alternatives were considered. The analysis of the method adequacy showed that the most appropriate methods of spatial impact evaluation in terms of agricultural land protection are those with multi-criteria approach, namely SMARTER method. The SMARTER method was tested on implementation of the section of the third corridor state motorway. This exercise proved the scenario F 5 to be most advantageous, having the lowest impact on the agricultural land followed by scenario F 6. The scenario F 1 proved to have the greatest influence on the agricultural land followed by F 2 which was in 2007 initially selected as the best option, considering all the evaluation aspects. Subsequently "optimized" scenario F 2 - 2 also showed considerate impact on the agricultural land, although the optimization was initially aimed to reduce the impacts on the agricultural land. The result of our evaluation showed that SMARTER method is suitable and effective method for spatial impacts evaluation of interventions on agricultural land. This study that for proposes the introduction and complementation of the existing methodology for spatial impact evaluation in terms of agricultural land protection as part of systematic spatial planning and management solutions in Slovenia and to pursue exploration and development of new evaluation methods for other aspects. ...|$|E

40|$|Sealing of soils {{prevents}} {{the exchange of}} gas, water and nutrient between soil and other environmental compartments, and affects urban N flux, thereby resulting in certain negative impacts on soil functioning and urban environment. However, little information {{is available on the}} biogeochemical cycling and biological activities after sealing of soils in urban areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of soil sealing on N transformation and associated microbial properties. Soil samples were collected at four depths (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 40 cm) from three land cover types: impervious <b>land</b> (<b>sealing</b> of soil), forest (vegetation) and bare land (no sealing and no vegetation) in Beijing, China. Soil inorganic N, net potential N-mineralization and nitrification rates, physicochemical properties, microbial biomass and activities of urease, protease and nitrate reductase were analyzed. Sealing of soils affected soil physicochemical properties, nutrient availability and microbial characterizations, which resulted in the reduction of soil net potential mineralization and nitrification. Soil pH and C/N ratio were increased while soil organic matter and total N were decreased after sealing of soils, especially in the 0 - 10 cm layer. Impervious sites had the lowest soil microbial biomass C (10. 52 - 26. 26 mg kg(- 1)) and N (10. 52 - 26. 26 mg kg(- 1)) among the three types of soils. In addition, microbial biomass increased along the depth gradient. Soil enzyme activities were also significantly affected by sealing of soils. Canonical correlation analysis suggested that reduction of soil net potential mineralization and nitrification in impervious sites was mainly caused by the variation of soil total N, soil organic matter and soil microbial biomass. Sealing of soils remarkably influenced the soil N transformation process and soil microbial activities in urban areas. Thus, our results suggested that reducing the negative effects of soil sealing on paved and unpaved areas could be useful measures to improve urban soil functions, and hence facilitate the remediation of the adverse impacts caused by urban N deposition...|$|E
