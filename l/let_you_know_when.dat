40|$|Unless {{you have}} a {{complete}} and precise description of a product 2 ̆ 7 s requirements, it is very unlikely that those requirements will be satisfied. An incomplete or inconsistent requirements document can mislead developers. A collection of statements in English, or some other natural language, cannot be checked for completeness {{and will not be}} precise. Even if you translate an informal requirements statement into a mathematical language, and show that the result is complete and unambiguous, the original may still be faulty. This talk describes a sound procedure for documenting requirements - one that <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> your document is complete and consistent. Documents produced by following this procedure can be reviewed by potential users and specialists and can serve as the input to tools that generate prototypes and monitors...|$|R

But there is a red-coat in the house whom we care not to trust farther than we could not help. We dared not, therefore, venture in by the hall; and so, prowling round the building, Albert informed us, that an old prank of his, when a boy, consisted of entering by this window. A lad who was with us would needs make the experiment, as there seemed to be no light in the chamber, and the moonlight without made us liable to be detected.

5000|$|He thought I {{was somehow}} more {{valuable}} than him and I could never live it down. I couldn't jump off the pedestal. He was unhappy about everything and I couldn't be happy about anything. I think that Billy is fantastic and, in his heart, he's {{one of the nicest}} people that you'll ever meet. It's just that he hasn't been acknowledged a lot in his life and he needs—and deserves—a lot of everything. I was just not the person who was able to give it to him. Unfortunately, if you really love someone, <b>you</b> <b>let</b> them <b>know</b> <b>when</b> they're bad, as well as when they're good. He needed as much positive reinforcement as he could get and never wanted to hear the negative. I learned that too late.
