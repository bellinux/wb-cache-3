5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the <b>Lyceum,</b> Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany.

Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
