A cable and surface equipment enabled deployment {{and operation of}} the vehicle from a surface support ship. The CURV-III carried: wo Vidicon television cameras, four mercury-vapor headlights, two mercury-vapor spotlights, and a 35-millimeter camera with a 500 frame color film capacity and strobe light ... mounted on two independent pan-and-tilt units, each with 360 degrees of lateral and 180 degrees of vertical movement. The vehicle thus has full viewing and self-inspection capability.Other support systems included active and passive sonar, altimeter, depthometer, and compass. It had a tool assembly mounted on the bow that included a manipulator claw. Other tools and <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> could be mounted for particular tasks.|$|E
2500|$|The Spaniards had {{various types}} of {{rudimentary}} hoists and cranes at their disposal for lifting materials to the men working {{on top of a}} structure. These machines were fashioned out of wood and rope, and were usually similar in configuration to a ship's rigging. In fact, sailors were often employed in mission construction to apply their knowledge of maritime rigging to the handling of loads. It is not apparent {{as to whether or not}} the padres used pulleys in their <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> but these instruments nevertheless got the job done. Unless adobes were protected from the elements they would eventually dissolve into nothing more than heaps of mud. Most adobe walls, therefore, were either whitewashed or stuccoed inside and out. [...] Whitewash was a mixture of lime and water which was brushed on the interior surfaces of partition walls; stucco was a longer-lasting, viscous blend of aggregate (in this case, sand) and whitewash, applied to the faces of load-bearing walls with a paleta (trowel). Usually the face of a wall that was to receive stucco would be scored so that the mixture would adhere better, or laborers would press bits of broken tile or small stones into the wet mortar to provide a varied surface for the stucco to cling to.|$|E

The <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> {{is characterized by}} a constructional shape which is easy to produce and easy to use. This is obtained by designing the support (2) of the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> {{in the form of a}} small hollow body comprising a cylindrical lifting wall (6) and a flat bottom wall (7) opposite said lifting wall, the lifting wall (6) being bent so that said <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> is large enough to surround the drive elements located in the support (2) and the bottom wall (7) and the lifting wall (6) meet, forming flat wedge-shaped edges...|$|R

This web-based boot includes boot body, <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> and support to support the feet and the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to fix on the boot body. The support uses the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> to connect {{to the bottom of}} the boot body, and through the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> function, it can have lifting displacement to the boot bottom. The workers put foot fixed on the support, so as to make the inflating lifting boots walk along with the workers. The adjusting <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> can make support member move far or near the bottom direction of boot body. The workers can lift higher or lower along with the support. The workers can adjust the <b>lifting</b> <b>device</b> according to specific work height, without using or moving ladder or stool, to save time and improve the work efficiency. At present, the global architecture decoration industry conducts decoration construction for the inside of the house, it needs electrical workers, wood workers, pipe workers and other types of workers for construction work. Because of the height of people, the workers need to use ladder or stool to complete the work in construction. After completing a certain work region, they need to walk off the ladder or stool and move the ladder or stool to next construction location. It need...|$|R
