40|$|Past, {{current and}} {{proposed}} emissions trading schemes include allowance banking provisions {{that range from}} no banking to unlimited banking. Some schemes establish a maximum lifetime, 2 to 10 years, for allowances and so limit the scope for banking. Allowance banking and life provisions affect environmental performance, economic efficiency and emitters’ behavior. This paper reviews theoretical predictions relating {{to the effects of}} banking and the consequences of the banking provisions adopted by different trading schemes. The environmental consequences depend in part on whether the pollutant is a “stock ” or “flow” pollutant. <b>Less</b> <b>restrictive</b> banking <b>provisions</b> enhance economic efficiency by improving price stability, facilitating adjustment to a change in the emissions cap and increasing liquidity in the allowance market. Banking provisions also affect the rate of non-compliance and the resulting excess emissions. Many schemes accumulate a relatively large bank, predictably or unexpectedly, when first implemented. This can have adverse environmental consequences and reduce the economic efficiency of the scheme...|$|R
50|$|Title IV - Nutrition. Title IV of {{the conference}} {{agreement}} would reduce nutrition spending by $8 billion over the 2014-2023 period, CBO estimates. The House-passed bill would reduce such spending by $39 billion over the 10-year period. It includes two provisions not contained in the conference agreement that would reduce spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by restricting the definition of categorical eligibility for the program and {{reducing the number of}} waivers from work requirements available for certain adult SNAP recipients. The Senate-passed bill would reduce nutrition spending by $4 billion over the next 10 years, about half the reduction in the conference agreement. It contains a proposal to limit heating and cooling allowances for SNAP participants that is <b>less</b> <b>restrictive</b> than the <b>provision</b> include in the conference agreement.|$|R
50|$|Section 1915(c) was an {{amendment}} to the Social Security Act created {{as a part of the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Adoption of HCBS waivers by states was initially slow, but Congress has enacted a series of reforms since 1981 to make the use of HCBS waivers less prohibitive. The Supreme Court case, Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), found unnecessary institutionalization to be a violation of the civil right established by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 that service be provided in the least restrictive environment. Olmstead allowed that states could be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act if they could demonstrate that they had a comprehensive, working plan to move people with disabilities into <b>less</b> <b>restrictive</b> settings. This <b>provision</b> along with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance on Olmstead compliance led to rapid adoption by the states of the HCBS waiver.|$|R

We gauge the strength of shareholder rights by measuring the number of <b>restrictive</b> governance <b>provisions</b> that suppress shareholder rights - the more restrictive the governance, the weaker the shareholder rights. We find that financial firms have <b>less</b> <b>restrictive</b> corporate governance, suggesting that financial regulations promote shareholder rights.
