6000|$|I {{think this}} reason is that, {{on the whole}} he is so peculiarly serious. This may seem an odd ground of praise for a jocose draughtsman, and of course what I mean is that his comic force is serious--a very {{different}} thin from the absence of comedy. This essential sign of the caricaturist may surely be anything it will {{so long as it}} is there. Daumier's figures are almost always either foolish, fatuous politicians or frightened, mystified bourgeois; yet they help him to give us a strong sense of the nature of man. They are some times so serious that they are almost tragic the look of the particular pretension, combined with inanity, is carried almost to madness. There is a magnificent drawing of the series of [...] "Le Public du Salon," [...] old classicists looking up, horrified and scandalized, at the new romantic work of 1830, in which the faces have an appalling gloom of mystification and platitude. We feel that Daumier reproduces admirably the particular life that he sees, because it is the very medium in which he moves. He has no wide horizon; the absolute bourgeois hems him in, and he is a bourgeois himself, without poetic ironies, to whom a big cracked mirror has been given. His thick, strong, manly touch stands, in every way, for so much knowledge. He used to make little images, in clay and in wax (many of them still exist), of the persons he was in the habit of representing, so that they might constantly seem to be [...] "sitting" [...] for him. The caricaturist of that day had not the help of the ubiquitous photograph. Daumier painted actively, as well, in his habitation, all dedicated to work, on the narrow island of St. Louis, where the Seine divides and where the monuments of old Paris stand thick, and the types that were to his purpose pressed close upon him. He had not far to go to encounter the worthy man, in the series of [...] "Les Papas," [...] who is reading the evening paper at the café with so amiable and placid a credulity, while his unnatural little boy, opposite to him, finds sufficient entertainment in the much-satirized Constitutionnel. The bland absorption of the papa, the face of the man who believes everything he sees in the newspaper, is as near as Daumier often comes to positive gentleness of humor. Of the same family is the poor gentleman, in [...] "Actualités," [...] seen, in profile, under a doorway where he has taken refuge from a torrent of rain, who <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> neat legs with a sort of speculative contrition and says. [...] "To think of my having just ordered two pairs of white trousers." [...] The tout petit bourgeois palpitates in both these sketches.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} for this track shows a rave {{taking place in}} an alley. Police {{officers}} suddenly arrive {{to break up the}} party. While several people are rounded up, a young woman who looks to be captured notices a stain on an officer's shirt. This triggers a flashback beginning with a tomato seed being planted, then sprouting, then harvested and then packaged. The packages are eventually transported to a grocery store where a lady selects the tomatoes to take home with her. As she is preparing tomato sauce, subtitles accurately instruct the viewer on the recipe for making the sauce for spaghetti. The lady places the prepared meal into a tupperware container. The officer from earlier in the video appears with the meal in his squad car. He dribbles the tomato sauce onto his shirt while eating it and creates the stain. This brings the flashback {{to the beginning of the}} video. When the officer <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> stained shirt and is distracted, the young woman gains the opportunity to flee. Someone appears on a platform above and pulls her to safety.|$|E

At first, Rogue is {{defensive}} and declares that no matter what her [...] "crazy mother" [...] told Augustus, she and Gambit are happy together. She explains that they, of course, have their problems, and Augustus replies that he doesn't have problems. Continuing on, Augustus states that Mystique wants Rogue to be happy, and no matter how Rogue feels for him, they should at least try to be friends, for there is so much strife in the world without the two of them fighting. He puts his hand on Rogue's shoulder, and she informs him, [...] "Mister, I wouldn't put your hand there." [...] He replies, [...] "You going to slap a suit on me for sexual harassment?" [...] Rogue replies that she isn't, and explains her power to him. He tells her not to worry about it and his eyes begin to glow.

50|$|Kristen {{has gone}} for another morning {{run along the}} same path she took, but breaks off to find a curious trail. Justin has {{suddenly}} become good at woodchopping, and breaks wood in half with his bare hands. He punches a nearby tree and <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand. Kristen has found a large cemetery of numerous individuals, all dated 1989, and the mysterious figure attacks her, only to be thwarted by her mace. Justin finds a parasite writhing about outside {{the back of his}} hand, pulls it out, and returns to woodchopping before encountering Marco who tells him he is planning to ask Jaimie’s hand in marriage. Justin hears screams twice, and runs off in the direction of Kristen. Kristen believes she escaped the man, but the man catches her from behind and shoves the parasite in his mouth down hers. Marco sits with Jaimie, who tells him the financial situation. At that point Larkin and Dr. Macavire ask to see Justin since they traced Kristen’s sunglasses to him by the body of the woman he murdered last night. Jaimie and Marco run away to warn Justin, and infected Sarah looks out to see what has been going on. Justin has found Kristen’s mutilated body as the militia approach him. Justin’s pupils disappear and adopt a singular gray hue as the parasites heighten his body’s abilities. He does quick work of every militia, but not before they gun down Marco. Jaimie was kidnapped by the mysterious figure before she could reach Justin, and Justin returns to his senses as he realizes the manslaughter he committed. He apologizes to Kristen before running away. Dr. Macavire, a policeman, and Larkin appear to murder any infected individuals and kill the larvae with salt. The policeman notices a parasite sliding back up Dr. Macavire’s leg and shoots him promptly.|$|E
50|$|John then narrates the {{beginning}} of the lives of his future band mates Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison and also {{the rest of his life}} until the point he meets Paul for the first time and they decide to play together. He then meets George and makes a writing partnership with Paul which works in a way to which if one of them writes a song they both get credit. Then John narrates the band's touring until they meet Brian Epstein for the first time and he agrees to get them a recording contract. When he does the band considers firing Pete Best as drummer but do not know who will replace him. Paul suggests Ringo Starr and he has been listening in the whole time and agrees so once again John starts to narrate but stops at the height of Beatlemania when his father returns to try to reap the fruits of John's success and tells him to go away so John narrates a huge portion of the Beatles' career and stops at the point where he meets Yoko Ono and develops a relationship with her. Some years later in John's career with the Beatles he becomes deeply depressed and is visited by a version of his cosmic self who tells him(self) that he needs to stop being so down on himself and get back to work writing and performing music. He agrees but little does John know former President of the United States Richard Nixon has an anti-Lennon plan in place and splinter cell assassin named Mark David Chapman has been brain-washed to kill Lennon when commanded to. So Lennon exits his apartment building The Dakota and is gunned down by Chapman. John is now dead and back in his plane (which is apparently heaven) he <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> former life and decides to make sure Chapman cannot get out of his murder charge on government pardon. He enters Chapman's thoughts and tells him to plead guilty. John then narrates once more the rest of his band mates' lives from 1980 through to the present and John one last time addresses the reader, saying that he has found peace and learned that peace can be found anywhere if one just imagines it.|$|E
5000|$|A drama {{version of}} the music video, which {{excludes}} the intercut sequences of choreographed dancing, was released on May 15, 2009. The video opens with a scene of a girl returning her ring to Kibum. A loud heart beat sounds when Kibum painfully walks away with the ring in his hand. Kibum passes by Han Geng, who somberly <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> phone. He whispers [...] "It's you, it's you, it's only you for me, it's you" [...] in Korean and walks away. Donghae appears behind him and walks down the street, followed by Kyuhyun who walks after him. Kyuhyun walks past a car parked in a street intersection, and Yesung {{walks out of the}} street. Leeteuk appears behind Yesung, playing with a necklace. As he walks {{toward the end of the}} street, Siwon hesitantly walks toward a phone booth. Ryeowook rushes past him holding a bouquet of flowers. As he smells the flowers, he whips past Kang-in who is sitting down at a table angrily reading a letter. Kyuhyun appears again and quickly unbuttons his jacket, checking the time on his watch. He walks by Eunhyuk, who is spraying graffiti on the wall with the words [...] "Only 4 U." [...] Kang-in walks into a coffee shop and passes by Sungmin who is writing a letter. Shindong walks out of the coffee shop, passing by Ryeowook who has been waiting in front of the shop. Ryeowook angrily throws down his bouquet of flowers, looks at his watch, and walks away. He passes by Han Geng, who is emotionally talking through his phone. Han Geng walks past Yesung and Eunhyuk doing a handshake in an alleyway, and Yesung walks past Sungmin, who is now mailing his letter. Kyuhyun quickly walks past Sungmin and passes by Heechul in the middle of the street, who is sitting on his motorcycle and taking off his helmet. The rest of the Super Junior members appear walking by Heechul, and Siwon is now shouting through the phone. He slams the phone back and hits the phone booth. Donghae angrily walks by and steps back as the camera pans toward the rest of the Super Junior members standing behind Heechul. As Heechul whispers the same words Han Geng whispered in the beginning of the video, Kibum holds his ring to his heart and the rest of the members follow while stand at the end of the video.|$|E

40|$|On May 28, 2013, Torrey Johnson 5 {{struggles to}} raise both his hands, handcuffed and seated shoulder-to-shoulder between two other {{defendants}} {{in the first}} row of the closed circuit television (“CCTV” or “videoconference”) bail review hearing room within the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (“Centeral Booking”). There are two more rows of defendants behind Mr. Johnson, all in yellow jumpsuits, being watched by correctional officers. Separated by a three-foot wall, Mr. Johnson’s public defender sits out of sight from the video camera’s field of view, about ten feet away from her client. The judge quickly reads through Mr. Johnson’s rights. A representative from the Pretrial Release Services Program (“Pretrial Release”) makes a recommendation that is broadcasted meekly from the courtroom. As the judge <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk to take notes, Mr. Johnson looks down and shakes his head. He disagrees with something the Pretrial Services representative said, and starts to speak. No one seems to hear Mr. Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s voice in his own bail review hearing. Mr. Johnson’s experience demonstrates the constitutional violations that many indigent defendants in Baltimore City disproportionately face as Maryland conducts bail review hearings on a television screen, not in person. Speed and convenience are the driving factors behind the state’s decision to hold bail hearings through videoconference systems. Mr. Johnson’s case {{is an example of the}} procedural problems raised when CCTV is used in bail review hearings, both in district and circuit courts. ...|$|E
40|$|Advertising {{research}} has focused exclusively on the solitary subject at the ex-pense of understanding the role that advertising plays within the social contexts of group interaction. We develop a number of explanations for this omission before describing {{the results of an}} ethnographic study of advertising’s contribu-tion to the everyday interactions of adolescent informants at a number of English high schools. The study reveals a series of new, socially related advertising-audience behaviors. Specifically, advertising meanings are shown to possess social uses relating to textual experience, interpretation, evaluation, ritual use, and metaphor. The theoretical and managerial implications of these social uses are then discussed. In the film Witness (Weir 1985) Harrison Ford plays JohnBook, a Philadelphia detective who has to go under cover in a local Amish community. On spending his first morning with the Amish family he is there to protect, Book is asked to join them at the table for breakfast. An embarrassed silence falls on the group as they begin their meal. Book, sensing the unease his presence has created, takes a long audible swig from his mug of coffee and exclaims, “Honey, that’s great coffee! ” The three members of the Amish family who have never seen television advertising before, and who are therefore unfamiliar with this catchphrase, look up in surprise and then confusion. Book is suddenly embarrassed by his attempt at humor and tries to explain his outburst: “It’s a joke [...] It’s a commercial [...] . on television. ” He <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> plate still embarrassed and suddenly aware of the very different culture in which he is now immersed...|$|E
40|$|Children {{are often}} {{compared}} to scientists, {{but even a}} perfect scientist, using experiments alone, would struggle to redis-cover all of human knowledge {{in the span of}} one lifetime. How then are children able to acquire a good fraction of this knowledge in just a few years? The answer must be that chil-dren do not discover everything they learn—they use their ability to reason intuitively about other people to learn what others already know. Our goal in this article is to sketch a for-mal analysis of learning from knowledgeable others that is based on Bayesian inference and a careful examination of the kinds of goals that give rise to human actions. We begin by addressing the need of learners to consider the particular goals of people in their environment. Imagine that while living in Paris, you decide to search for the best cup of coffee in the city. As you wander, you find your-self a good distance away from your neighborhood. You observe three pieces of evidence: First, a man wearing a baseball cap and an “I Heart Paris ” T-shirt (obviously a tourist) turns into Cafe 1, buys a coffee, and <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cup. Second, Véronique, a woman from your neighborhood, enters Cafe 2 to get a coffee, and looks down at her cup. Third, Madeleine, another woman from your neighborhood, goes into Cafe 3 and buys a cup. Madeleine sees you, and she nods at the coffee. Which cafe would you think has the best coffee? You can infer very little about the coffee at Cafe 1, because the tourist likely chose the cafe at random. Cafe 2 was visited by a local, but maybe Véronique was just strapped for time and grabbed a cuppa wherever she could. Without knowing her motivations, you can’t tell whether she had gone {{out of her way to}} go to this particular cafe (though you may guess at her motivations, and hence guess her beliefs about the cafe). On the other hand, at Cafe 3, Madeleine telegraphed her intentions to you: She was there for the coffee, and she congratulated you for figuring out a local secret. Although nothing is certain (for example, Mad-eleine could have terrible taste), Cafe 3 seems likely to have the best coffee, and Cafe 2 is likely to have better coffee tha...|$|E
