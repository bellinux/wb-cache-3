5000|$|Especially at ski areas, {{chairlifts}} {{are referred}} to with a ski industry vernacular. <b>A</b> one-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "single", <b>a</b> two-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "double", <b>a</b> three-person <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> “triple”, four-person <b>lifts</b> are “quads”, and <b>a</b> six-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "six pack".

In March 2009, Obama <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dramatic conclusions to a league season in the history of the English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title decider also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book Fever Pitch.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again <b>lifted.</b> <b>A</b> blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E
50|$|MacAskill {{was well}} known for feats of {{strength}} such as <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> ship's anchor weighing 2800 lb to chest height, {{and an ability to}} carry barrels weighing over 350 lb apiece under each arm or reputedly able to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> hundredweight (50 kg) with two fingers and hold it at arms length for ten minutes.

5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|Maamaloa Lolohea {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics on Tonga's behalf, {{competing}} in weightlifting. Lolohea was born in Kolofo'ou, a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40-year-old in the men's super-heavyweight class division, which encompasses athletes who weigh more than 105kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes. During the snatch phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127kilograms on his first attempt, 135kilograms on his second attempt, and 140kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the clean and jerk phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173kilograms on his first try, but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 in clean and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313kilograms. Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind Sam Pera, Jr. of the Cook Islands (350kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's Antti Everi (366kilograms). Gold medalist Matthias Steiner of Germany, in contrast, <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> total of 461kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Minginfel was {{the only}} {{weightlifter}} at the Beijing Olympics who competed {{under the banner of}} the Federated States of Micronesia. He participated in the men's featherweight class, which includes athletes of 62kilograms and below. Born in Yap, Minginfel was 21 years old when he first competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Although he was unable to successfully lift any snatches at those games, Minginfel finished in his event when at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, at 25 years old. The Micronesian athlete was 29 years old {{when he returned to the}} Olympics for the third time in 2008. During the course of his event, which took place on August 11, Minginfel {{was the only}} Oceanian competing against 16 other athletes. While on the snatch phase, Minginfel successfully lifted 115kilograms on his first attempt and 120kilograms on his second attempt, but failed to lift 123kilograms on his third try. However, he succeeded in all of his clean and jerks, and successfully lifted 145kilograms; 150kilograms; then 155kilograms. His final score, which combines his highest lifted weight from the snatch and clean and jerk categories, was 275kilograms. Of the 12 athletes who finished the event, Minginfel ranked 11th ahead of Canadian weightlifter Jasvir Singh (266kilograms) and behind Henadzy Makhveyenia of Belarus (278kilograms). In comparison, gold medalist Zhang Xiangxiang of China <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> combined total of 319kilograms.|$|E
