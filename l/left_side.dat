5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the brain interacts with {{the right side of the}} body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the body, and visual input from the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the visual field.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose {{right side of the}} body is Shiva and <b>left</b> <b>side</b> is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side of the body is the male Shiva and <b>left</b> <b>side</b> is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E

Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on the <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a single fixed graph G on <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |V(H)|O(|V(G)|), so polynomial {{in the size of}} the input graph H. In other words, the problem is trivially in P for graphs G of bounded size. The interesting question is then what other properties of G, beside size, make polynomial algorithms possible.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cholecystectomy is the {{surgical}} removal of gallbladder for symptomatic gallstones disease or where exist {{the risk of}} gallbladder malignancy. Its performed routinely across the globe often as day surgery. In this case report, we describe an incidental intra operative finding of a <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder creating a technical challenge for the surgeon. Case: We describe the case of 35  year old female who presented with RUQ pain. Ultrasound examination revealed gallstones. Intraoperative findings during routine cholecystectomy were of a <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder. The surgical procedure in performing laparoscopic surgery required an extra port placement for safe and effective dissection. Discussion: The finding of <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly and has a prevalence of 0. 1 – 0. 7 %. A true <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder {{is one that is}} found {{to the left of the}} ligamentum teres and falciform ligament and the cystic artery always crosses in front of the CBD from right to left. There are various abnormalities associated this anatomical variant from abnormality of the biliary tree to the porto-venous anatomy. Failure to recognise these variations can lead to serious complications especially in hepatobiliary surgery. Conclusion: The finding of <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder is an abnormality which is often discovered intraoperatively. It may provide the surgeon with operative challenges in performing the surgery safely and increase the incidence of morbidity. If there is any clinical suspicion of the presence of a <b>left</b> <b>sided</b> gallbladder, pre-operative CT angiography and/or intraoperative cholangiography should be performed to minimise the risk of intraoperative complications...|$|R
