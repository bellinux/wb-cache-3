5000|$|After {{the first}} B-17s were {{delivered}} to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they were used on promotional flights promoting their <b>long</b> <b>range</b> and <b>navigational</b> capabilities. In January 1938, group commander Colonel Robert Olds flew a YB-17 from the United States's east coast to its west coast, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours 27 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging 245 mi/h km/h in 11 hours 1 minute. Six bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group took off from Langley Field on 15 February 1938 {{as part of a}} goodwill flight to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Covering 12000 mi they returned on 27 February, with seven aircraft setting off on a flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, three days later. In a well-publicized mission on 12 May of the same year, three B-17s [...] "intercepted" [...] and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner SS Rex 610 mi off the Atlantic coast.|$|R
