5|$|In 1809, {{the makeup}} of the <b>legislature</b> was altered again by Congress to a {{bicameral}} body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population. The House was then to choose ten candidates from whom the President, through the governor, would choose five to form a council which served as the upper house of the <b>legislature.</b> Thereafter, the structure of the <b>legislature</b> remained unchanged {{for the remainder of the}} territory's existence.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} <b>legislature</b> {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the {{enforcement}} mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state <b>legislature</b> in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The <b>legislature</b> fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

Lovejoy was elected to the first session of this <b>legislature,</b> first serving in the lower chamber Oregon House of Representatives. Representing Clackamas District again, he also became the first Speaker of the Oregon Territorial <b>Legislature.</b> In 1851, he returned to the <b>legislature,</b> serving in the upper chamber Council. The following year, he remained in the Council, but now elected as a Whig Party politician. In 1854, he was back in the House of Representatives, and in 1856 he served in one final session, now as a Democratic Party member.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Legislatures</b> of British India {{included}} legislative {{bodies in}} the presidencies and provinces of British India, the Imperial Legislative Council, the Chamber of Princes and the Central Legislative Assembly. The <b>legislatures</b> were created under Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Initially serving as small advisory councils, the <b>legislatures</b> evolved into partially elected bodies, but were never elected through universal suffrage. Provincial <b>legislatures</b> saw boycotts {{during the period of}} dyarchy between 1919 and 1935. After reforms and elections in 1937, the largest parties in provincial <b>legislatures</b> formed governments headed by a Prime Minister. A few British Indian subjects were elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which had superior powers than colonial <b>legislatures.</b> British Indian <b>legislatures</b> did not include Burma's legislative assembly after 1937, the State Council of Ceylon nor the legislative bodies of princely states.|$|R

5|$|The Northwest Territories {{marked a}} new era when the {{legislative}} council moved into a newly constructed <b>legislature</b> building on November 17, 1993. The new <b>legislature</b> was the first building built specifically for the Northwest Territories government since the government sat in Regina 88 years earlier. The <b>legislature</b> building was constructed to feature themes derived from the Inuit culture, which signaled {{that the government was}} sensitive to the ethnicity of the resident population.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional <b>Legislature</b> held session {{mainly in}} Oregon City. They met at {{different}} times each year, and in 1848 they did not meet; too many members had left for the California gold fields.

5|$|The Provisional <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon was the single-chamber {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Provisional Government of Oregon. It served the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest of North America from 1843 until early 1849 {{at a time when}} no country had sovereignty over the region. This democratically elected <b>legislature</b> became the Oregon Territorial <b>Legislature</b> when the territorial authorities arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives. Over the course of its six-year history the <b>legislature</b> passed laws, including taxation and liquor regulation, and created an army to deal with conflicts with Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial <b>legislatures</b> are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have <b>legislatures,</b> but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial <b>legislatures</b> also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|R

5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican <b>legislature</b> {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the <b>legislature</b> were more responsible, 21% said the DFL {{governor}} was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the <b>legislature</b> more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and <b>legislature,</b> as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

In the years that followed, the Alaska <b>Legislature</b> voted several times to allocate state funding for the project.

5|$|As the {{population}} of the territory grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, the territory was granted permission to fully elect its own <b>legislature</b> for the first time. Before that, Governor Harrison appointed the <b>legislature.</b> Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be legal in the territory, but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was at odds with the new <b>legislature,</b> which proceeded to overturn the indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained the defining issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the <b>legislature</b> did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E
