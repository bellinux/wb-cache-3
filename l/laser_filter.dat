50|$|Another {{fundamental}} {{concept of}} all AFM is the feedback loop. The feedback loop {{is particularly important}} in non-contact AFM techniques, particularly in pc-AFM. As previously mentioned, in non-contact mode the cantilever is stationary and the tip does not come into physical contact with the sample surface. The cantilever behaves as a spring and oscillates at its resonance frequency. Topological variance causes the spring-like oscillations of the cantilever to change amplitude and phase {{in order to prevent}} the tip from colliding with sample topographies. The non-contact feedback loop is used to control that changes in the oscillations of the cantilever. The application of AFM on non-conducting samples (c-AFM) has in recent years evolved into the modification used for analysis of morphologies on the local scale, particularly morphologies at heterojunctions of multilayered samples. Photoconductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM) is particularly prevalent in the development of organic photovoltaic devices (OPV). The fundamental modification of c-AFM to pc-AFM is the addition of an illumination source and an inverted microscope that focuses the laser to a nanometer-scale point directly underneath the conductive AFM tip. The main concept of the illumination laser point is that it must be small enough to fit within the confines of ultra-thin films. These characteristics are achieved by using a monochromatic light source and a <b>laser</b> <b>filter.</b> In the OPV application, applying the illumination laser to the confines of ultra-thin films is further assisted by the recent development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) mixture of electron donating and accepting material in the film.The combination of the conductive tip and illumination laser provides photocurrent images with vertical resolutions in the range of 0 to 10 pA when overlaid with the topographical data obtained. Also unique to this modification are the spectra data gathered by comparing the current between the tip and sample to a variety of parameters including: laser wavelength, applied voltage and light intensity. The pc-AFM technique was also reported to detect local surface oxidation at a vertical resolution of 80 nm.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} involved for pc-AFM is {{very similar}} to that necessary for traditional AFM or the modified conductive AFM. The main difference between pc-AFM and other types of AFM instruments is the illumination source that is focused through the inverted microscope objective and the neutral density filter that is positioned adjacent to the illumination source. The technical parameters of pc-AFM are identical to those of traditional AFM techniques. This section will focus on the instrumentation necessary for AFM and then detail the requirements for pc-AFM modification. The main instrumental components to all AFM techniques are the conductive AFM cantilever and tip, the modified piezo components and the sample substrate. The components for photoconductive modification include: the illumination source (532 nm <b>laser),</b> <b>filter</b> and inverted microscope. When modifying traditional AFM for pc application, all components must be combined such that they do not interfere with one another and so that various sources of noise and mechanical interference do not disrupt the optical components. In traditional instrumentation, the stage is a cylindrical piezo-tube scanner that minimizes the effect of mechanical noise. Most cylindrical piezos are between 12 and 24 mm in length and 6 and 12 mm in diameter. The exterior of the piezo-tube is coated with a thin layer of conducting metal so that this region can sustain an electric field. The interior of the cylinder is divided into four regions (x and y regions) by non-conducting metallic strips. Electrical leads are fixed to one end and the exterior wall of the cylinder so that a current can be applied. When a voltage is applied to the exterior, the cylinder expands in x and y direction. Voltage along the interior of the tube causes cylinder expansion in the z-direction and thus movement of the tip in the z-direction. The placement of the piezo tube is dependent upon the type of AFM performed and the mode of analysis. However the z-piezo must always be fixed above the tip and cantilever to control the z-motion. This configuration is most often seen in the c-AFM and pc-AFM modifications to make room for additional instrumental components which are placed below the scanning stage. This is particularly true for pc-AFM, which must have the piezo-components arranged above the cantilever and tip so that the illumination laser can transmit through the sample.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBeside {{the total}} laser power, the laser beam {{diameter}} {{is a significant}} factor for the resistance of <b>laser</b> protection <b>filters</b> to <b>laser</b> radiation. In this paper {{a study of the}} resistance of <b>laser</b> protection <b>filters</b> to <b>laser</b> radiation in dependence of the laser beam diameter is given. For the investigation of this effect an experimental setup is realized, which detects laser radiation near the MPE value (ref. 1) (Maximum Permissible Exposure; level of laser radiation to which, under normal circumstances, persons may be exposed without suffering adverse effects) behind the filter glasses, which is taken as a criteria for the failure of <b>laser</b> protection <b>filters.</b> This failure defines the laser resistance time of the protection filter under the given laser parameters (laser power and laser beam diameter). The experiments involve a series of irradiations from a cw (continuous wave) Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nm) with the variation of laser power, laser beam diameter and with different material thicknesses. The dependency of the laser resistance time follows a power function of the laser beam diameter.

In this work, we investigate the stability of <b>lasers</b> which use <b>filtered</b> optical feedback for wavelength tuning. We investigate experimentally the dynamics induced by this on-chip filtered optical feedback. In this study, we choose to use a compact device which combines a semiconductor ring <b>laser</b> with on-chip <b>filtered</b> optical feedback to achieve wavelength tunability. The filtered optical feedback is realized by employing two arrayed waveguide gratings to split/recombine light into di€erent wavelength channels. Semiconductor optical amplifiers are placed in the feedback loop in order to control the feedback of each wavelength channel independently. Experimental observations show that the stability of the clockwise and counterclockwise propagation modes depends on the feedback strength. Experiments also show that for a specific range of the feedback strength, anti-phase oscillations in the intensity of the clockwise and counterclockwise propagating modes can be induced. These oscillations could not be seen in the same semiconductor ring <b>laser</b> without <b>filtered</b> optical feedback. We investigate how the frequency and the amplitude of these oscillations change under the e€ect of filtered optical feedback.

40|$|A {{confocal}} {{laser scanning}} microscope (CLSM) collects information from a thin, focal plane and ignores out-of-focus information. Scanning of a specimen, with stepwise axial (Z-) movement of the stage in between each scan, produces Z-series of confocal images of a tissue volume, which then {{can be used to}} 3 -D reconstruct structures of interest. The operator first configures separate channels (e. g., <b>laser,</b> <b>filters,</b> and detector settings) for each applied fluorochrome and then acquires Z-series of confocal images: one series per channel. Channel signal separation is extremely important. Measures to avoid bleaching are vital. Post-acquisition deconvolution of the image series is often performed to increase resolution before 3 -D reconstruction takes place. In the 3 -D reconstruction programs described in this unit, reconstructions can be inspected in real time from any viewing angle. By altering viewing angles and by switching channels off and on, the spatial relationships of 3 -D-reconstructed structures with respect to structures visualized in other channels can be studied. Since each brand of CLSM, computer program, and 3 -D reconstruction package has its own proprietary set of procedures, a general approach is provided in this protocol wherever possible. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} for {{suppression}} of coupling from guided optical modes into cladding modes in an optical fibre Bragg grating using a fibre with a strongly depressed cladding is proposed. Strong {{suppression of the}} coupling has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. Optical fibre Bragg gratings have attracted much attention in recent years due to their numerous applications such as reflectors for fibre <b>lasers,</b> <b>filters,</b> and sensors. They {{can be used to}} build add/drop filters for use in wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) systems [l]. Chirped gratings are also used for dispersion compensation in optical fibre links and for pulse shaping [2]. In a fibre grating with a photosensitive core, the guided LPO 1 mode, however, does not only reflect into the LPO 1 mode itself but also into cladding modes and radiation modes which are eventually absorbed by the high refractive polymer coating. This coupling causes a series of loss bands at the short wavelength side of the main Bragg band. This loss can be quite severe in strong gratings (more than 10 dB has been measured in some gratings) and restricts the use of these gratings in a WDM system. On...|$|R

40|$|Optical micro-cavities {{of various}} types have emerged as {{promising}} photonic structures, for both the investigation of fundamental science in cavity quantum electrodynamics and simultaneously for various applications, e. g., <b>lasers,</b> <b>filters,</b> or modulators. In either branch a demand for adjustable and tunable photonic devices becomes apparent, which has been mainly based on the modification of the refractive index of the micro-resonators so far. In this paper, we report on a novel type of whispering gallery mode resonator where resonance tuning is achieved by modification of the configuration. This is realized by polymeric split-disks consisting of opposing half-disks with an intermediate air gap. Functionality of the split-disk concept and its figures of merit like low-threshold lasing are demonstrated for laser dye-doped split-disks fabricated by electron beam lithography on Si substrates. Reversible resonance tuning is achieved for split-disks structured onto elastomeric substrates by direct laser writing. The gap width and hence the resonance wavelength can be well-controlled by mechanically stretching the elastomer and exploiting the lateral shrinkage of the substrate. We demonstrate a broad spectral tunability of laser modes by {{more than three times}} the free spectral range. These cavities have the potential to form a key element of flexible and tunable photonic circuits based on polymers...|$|R
