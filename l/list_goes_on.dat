2500|$|Although the sonnets were {{published}} in 1609, the exact date of when they were written is unclear. It is estimated that the sonnets could have been written between 1588 and 1593. The sonnets are written about two characters in particular: the Dark Lady and an unknown young man. Scholar Kenneth Muir states that the first 126 sonnets were written about a man {{and the others were}} written about the Dark Lady. The identity of the young man is still a mystery today. The only clue that was left about who this young man may be is Shakespeare's dedication to a [...] "Mr. W.H". There has been much speculation of whether who this young man may be. Many scholars have their own idea of who [...] "Mr. W.H." [...] may be. In Raymond Macdonald Alden's book, he has a chapter dedicated to who [...] "the friend's" [...] true identity may be. William Harte was one name that was thrown out there. William Harte was Shakespeare's nephew but the dates do not match up with the sonnet. Scholar Tyrwhitt suggests the name William Hughes. This name was quite the popular choice. The <b>list</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> and on. Scholars thought any man with the initials [...] "W.H." [...] that were active around the same time the sonnets were written could have been this mystery man. Mr. W.H. will remain a mystery till this day.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} staff writers with Bicycle Motocross Action, having a monthly {{editorial}} article, and co-founded BMX Plus! with Jim Stevens. After he gave up racing to devote more time to his company, SE Racing, he made it to be one of the more innovative organizations in the niche industry of BMX. At least two products bicycle frames conceived in the mid 1970s survive on the market today in modernized form: The Quadangle and the P.K. Ripper the former known for its highly distinctive configuration the other for being the first truly successful aluminum bicycle frame. They are sold by SE Racing-now known as Sports Engineering Racing-to this day, long after many beloved but now obsolete 1970s and 1980s era frames have become beloved museum pieces. Over this was a persistent dark cloud over Breithaupt; that of drug abuse, that had been with him since the l980s and tied to the untimely loss of his father. It has resulted in his incarceration on three different occasions although he was in his 5th year of recovery as of April 2010. [...] He started the first large wheel (26-inch) Cruiser Classes with the sanctioning bodies, attracting more adults to the sport. He even set bicycle long distant jump (assisted by being towed by a motorcycle) records. He had a hand in starting the first attempt of a racer's Professional Guild in 1976. The <b>list</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> His being one of the organized sport's first champions (NBA National Champion in 1976) is almost a footnote. Many of the sport's early stars can trace their career beginnings to Breithaupt's Long Beach B.U.M.S. course.|$|E

The amp, known for its [...] "jangly" [...] high-end sound, was used with several classic guitars in the studio including a Fender Tele, Les Paul, Gibson 335-S and a Rickenbacker. Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, but it sounds bigger." [...] Jordan Pundik likewise accounted; [...] "he [...] brought this classic vibe to it, especially with the tones he got. We learned we don't have to double-up 15 Mesa cabinets and make it all distorted to make it sound big." [...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve got to put the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that." [...] He did admit that around thirty songs were written, including some fast-paced songs, but were excluded as, [...] "(they) didn't really fit." [...] Steve Klein, the band's principal lyricist and rhythm guitarist, also praised Panunzio for helping the band bring new elements to their sound. Describing the sessions as [...] "best recording experience ever", he added, [...] "It's this empty mansion where we were able to set up all our equipment, we just woke up and wrote songs. We were really relaxed and able to set our own pace. Everything about the record is way more classic rock sounding because Thom has done a bunch of classic rock records like Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy, and the <b>list</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> and on.
