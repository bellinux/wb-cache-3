2500|$|When {{all of a}} player's {{checkers}} are in that player's home board, that player {{may start}} removing them; this is called [...] "bearing off". A roll of 1 {{may be used to}} bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if {{there is a way to}} use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so.|$|E

50|$|One can {{distinguish}} between obverse and reverse brockages. Obverse brockages {{occur when the}} previously struck coin was not ejected and gets stuck to the <b>lower</b> <b>die,</b> and reverse brockages when the previously struck coin remains stuck to the upper die.|$|E
50|$|In {{the rubber}} pad forming process only a milled <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes rubber pad pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with rubber pad forming.|$|E

An inverted type of blanking die that punches upwards, leaving the part sitting on the lower punch (after being shed from the upper matrix on the press return stroke) instead of blanking the part through. A compound die allows the cutting of internal and external part features on a single press stroke.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is a form}} of bending used {{to produce}} long, thin sheet metal parts. The machine that bends the metal is called a press brake. The lower part of the press {{contains}} a V-shaped groove called the die. The upper part of the press contains a punch that presses the sheet metal down into the v-shaped die, causing it to bend. There are several techniques used, but the most common modern method is [...] "air bending". Here, the die has a sharper angle than the required bend (typically 85 degrees for a 90 degree bend) and the upper tool is precisely controlled in its stroke to push the metal down the required amount to bend it through 90 degrees. Typically, a general purpose machine has an available bending force of around 25 tonnes per metre of length. The opening width of the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> is typically 8 to 10 times the thickness of the metal to be bent (for example, 5 mm material could be bent in a 40 mm die). The inner radius of the bend formed in the metal is determined not by the radius of the upper tool, but by the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> width. Typically, the inner radius is equal to 1/6 of the V-width used in the forming process.|$|E

The other solution is to apply a counter pressure by inserting an elastomer ring into the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> in order to compensate the elastic die deflection.|$|E

50|$|Rubber pad forming can be {{accomplished}} in many different ways, and as technology has advanced, so have the applications for this simple process. In general, an elastic upper die, usually made of rubber, is connected to a hydraulic press. A rigid <b>lower</b> <b>die,</b> often called a form block, provides the mold for the sheeted metal to be formed to. Because the upper (male) die {{can be used with}} separate lower (female) dies, the process is relatively cheap and flexible. The worked metal is not worn as quickly as in more conventional processes such as deep drawing, however, rubber pads exert less pressure in the same circumstances as non-elastic parts, which may lead to less definition in forming, and rubber pads wear more quickly than steel parts.|$|E
50|$|The device {{consists}} of the upper case and the lower case with the upper die and the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> installed therein respectively, and sliders that are kinematically interconnected with the cases by means of guides of special design and hold side dies attached thereto. The device is installed on a tool table of an open-die forging press as easy as ordinary dies. Thereat, the lower case of the device is fixed to the tool table and always remains stationary while the upper case {{is attached to the}} press ram and always travels along with it. When the press ram goes up the upper die also goes up and the side dies are retracted opening the device working space whereto a work piece is fed by a manipulator. When the press ram goes down the work piece is reduced simultaneously by four dies. Then the cycle repeats.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages bars {{of metal}} were cast and {{hammered}} {{out on an}} anvil. Portions of the flattened sheets were then cut out with shears, struck between dies and again trimmed with shears. A similar method {{had been used in}} Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 300 BC), but had been forgotten. Square pieces of metal were also cut from cast bars, converted into round disks by hammering and then struck between dies. In striking, the <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> was fixed into a block of wood, and the blank piece of metal laid upon it by hand. The upper die was then placed on the blank, and kept in position by means of a holder round which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer. An early improvement was the introduction of a tool resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies between blows, and ensured greater accuracy in the impression.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{plane strain}} small punch test (SPT) method is {{proposed}} for material plastic properties characterization. The plane strain SPT {{is different from}} the standard SPT in the two ways: (a) a long thin rectangular specimen (with dimensions of about 20 mm× 8 mm× 0. 5 mm) is used, and (b) the resulting test tool components - such as punch head and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> - are also different. The punch head is a prism with a half-circular shape and the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> consists of left and right long blocks, with a chamfer at each of the inner top corners of the <b>lower</b> <b>die.</b> The tool components have been designed and assembled and the plane strain small punch tests have been performed to obtain the punch force and the corresponding central displacements of the specimen.

30|$|In {{the drawing}} process, the sheet metal and punch are {{in close contact}} with each other when {{entering}} the die cavity. During this process, the sheet metal slides through the blank holder and <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> surface. Therefore, friction must be increased between the sheet metal and punch or decreased between the metal sheet and blank-holder or <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> to improve formability (Gong et al. 2011). Gong et al. (2011) used a diamond-like carbon coated blank holder and <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> in a cylindrical cup microforming experiment to reduce friction between the metal sheet and <b>lower</b> <b>die</b> and the blank holder, thereby enhancing formability. Additionally, the micro-features can be used to change the physical properties of the contact surface of the material (Segu and Kim 2014). Steinhoff et al. (1996) investigated the use of deterministic and stochastic surface structures in strip drawing processes. The experimental result shows that the hydrostatic lubrication pockets results in a considerable improvement of the tribological behaviour. Costa and Hutchings (2009) studied the friction effects of controlled surface patterning in tribological situations by using the strip drawing test. The result shows that the relative orientation between the pattern and the drawing direction strongly influenced the friction performance. Moreover, Lin et al. (2015) adopted a microridge punch design that increased not only the friction between the sheet metal and the punch but also the pulling force of the microridges on the sheet metal, distributing the pulling force of the punch on the sheet metal to the microridges. This dispersed the pulling force at the nasal fillet of the punch on the sheet metal and substantially increased drawability.|$|E
