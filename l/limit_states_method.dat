The necessary quantity of armature reinforcement was determined by the <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> <b>method.</b> While dimensioning the span reinforced concrete plate, we used charts, provided by the manufacturer of particular sheet metal and a computer programme for calculating span ceilings used by the company Trimo. While dimensioning secondary beams (regular and span), we took in account European standards. After we established necessary quantity of materials for each type of ceiling, regarding the given load and span, we converted the results into final price. The prices were provided by the supplies department of the company Trimo. The price of each material consists of its transport to the construction site and its actual construction.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} static analysis of the load-bearing construction, built in 2008 {{as a part of}} the multi-residential building. Load-bearing construction is made out of reinforced concrete and consists of walls, walls with openings and deep beams which interconnect with the monolith horizontal plates. The design is carried out in accordance with the current Eurocode standards. The impacts, which affect the building as self-load and permanent loads, imposed loads, snow and wind loads and also seismic effects, are taken into account. When designing the load-bearing construction the focus is on analysis of typical load-bearing elements. Analysis is based on idealized computer models made in commercial programs SAFE (horizontal plate), ETABS (vertical load-bearing elements) and SAP (deep beam). The design of load bearing elements is done by the <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> <b>method.</b> Vertical load-bearing elements were however additionally designed in accordance with capacity design method. The purpose of the thesis is to compare the amount of reinforcement established in accordance with the Eurocode standards with the built-in reinforcement established under the old Yugoslav regulations PBAB. The comparison in the ceiling plate indicates that the deviation in the amount of the necessary and built-in reinforcement is due to differences in the accuracy of computational models. Deviations between built-in and necessary reinforcements in the deep beam are also consequences of a more accurate model used in the thesis. On that account, the amount of built-in reinforcement exceeds the amount of reinforcement established under Eurocodes; however the diagonal hanging reinforcement required in the juncture of transverse wall and deep beam is not built-in. The amount of reinforcement embedded in the wall without openings exceeds the amount of reinforcement defined under Eurocodes. When comparing vertical reinforcement in the wall between beams, we discover that less reinforcement is built-in than required by Eurocodes. Also, the amount of built-in shear reinforcement in the specified beam is smaller than amount calculated in the thesis. Analysis and design results are presented in the reinforcement drawings enclosed at the end of the thesis...|$|E

The proposed procedure for calculating depth can be used in any case, because it gives a more conservative depth for lower subgrades and smaller depth for higher subgrades when compared to the existing methods. Depth calculated using the new approach agreed well with finite-element method (FEM), and also it satisfied the criterion for development length in compression (Ldc) for lower subgrades. For higher subgrades, depth should be calculated using the maximum of the LSM, the new approach, or minimum reinforcement approach. Reynolds’s handbook approach should not be used for higher subgrades, because it results in a lower depth than FEM. For the calculation of rigid depth, the total moment should be considered, which could be calculated by the conventional method or by Reynolds’s handbook equations.|$|R

The <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> of the structure is expressed in terms of the nodal displacements to accommodate either ultimate or serviceability conditions. The response failure surface is an approximation to the actual failure surface with several hyper-planes.

40|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of civil engineering dealing with the analysis and design of the structure that support or resist the loads. Structural engineers are most commonly involved {{in the design of}} buildings and large non building structures. Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy given design criteria, predicated on safety (e. g. structures must not collapse without due warning) or serviceability and performance (e. g. building sway must not cause discomfort to the occupants). Structural engineers ensure that buildings and bridges are built to be strong enough and stable enough to resist all appropriate structural loads (e. g., gravity, wind, snow, rain, seismic (earthquake), earth pressure, temperature, and traffic) in order to prevent or reduce loss of life or injury. They also design structures to be stiff enough to not deflect or vibrate beyond acceptable limits. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyses and design G+ 4 commercial building (hospital). We have adopted <b>Limit</b> <b>State</b> <b>Method</b> for analysis and designing the structure. The design is conformation with IS 456 - 2000. We bear in mind that Structural design should satisfy the ultimate strength, in flexure, shear, compression, tension, torsion, developed under a given system of loads and satisfy the serviceability, which limits deflection and cracking to be within acceptable limit...|$|R
