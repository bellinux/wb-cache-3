5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine {{the composition of the}} Solar System 4.5billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.

5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way {{is a factor in}} the evolutionary history of <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E

Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> {{is not well}} understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are an {{important}} natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.

5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for <b>life</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
