5|$|After {{joining the}} San Francisco Giants in 1962, Pierce played {{a pivotal role}} in helping them win the NL pennant, going 120 in home games and getting a three-hit shutout and a save in a three-game playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the title. His 1,999 career strikeouts were the fifth most by a <b>left-hander</b> when he retired, and his AL total of 1,842 ranked ninth in league history. He also ranked tenth among left-handers in career wins (211), sixth in games started (432) and games pitched (585), eighth in shutouts (38) and ninth in innings pitched (3,306⅔). He holds the White Sox {{franchise}} record for career strikeouts (1,796), and his club marks of 186 wins, 2,931 innings and 390 starts are team records for a <b>left-hander.</b> The White Sox retired his number 19 in 1987, and unveiled a statue in his honor at U.S. Cellular Field in 2007; he was selected to the White Sox All-Century Team in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 season saw Bumgarner set career bests for ERA (2.77), walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (1.03) and strikeouts (199) in 31 starts, {{finishing}} with a 13–9 record. Bumgarner's WHIP {{was the lowest}} for a Giants' <b>left-hander</b> since Carl Hubbell's in 1933. Bumgarner was also selected by Giants manager Bruce Bochy and {{the manager of the}} National League team, to pitch in the All Star game for the first time. However, Bumgarner didn't pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{lost the}} World Series in , while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 2–0 in their {{respective}} World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium). For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 {{marked the beginning of}} the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankee <b>left-hander</b> Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a <b>left-hander</b> at Yankee Stadium and the first no-hitter by a Yankee since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a Yankee since 1951.|$|E

40|$|Many studies {{report that}} <b>left-handers</b> have a shorter {{longevity}} than right-handers, {{and the present}} study may provide a possible explanation for that finding. In a Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit for the elderly {{with a mean age}} of 75. 2 years the prevalence of <b>left-handers</b> was 16. 7 % This latter value was significantly different (p 0. 0028) from the 6. 7 % in controls of similar age. These data suggest that heart disease may be one reason for a reduced longevity among <b>left-handers.</b> <b>Left-handers</b> use the right hemisphere for movement, and unilateral activation of that hemisphere in the form of EEG desynchronization and deactivation in the form of EEG slow waves are both related to cardiac abnormalities...|$|R
5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a <b>left-hander</b> since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most {{recorded}} in a perfect game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Robson had reached the top 50 {{for the first time in}} her career. She {{followed}} this with her first victory at the Australian Open with a convincing straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow <b>left-hander,</b> Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After stopping for several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World Group II Play-off spot against Argentina. Following this success she went on to lose two successive matches, losing to Daniela Hantuchová in Doha and to wildcard Yulia Putintseva in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Richards {{preferred}} to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started only every fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for big {{games against the}} powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that although it was essentially a compliment to Pierce's ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run {{in the ninth inning}} with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of 39⅔ consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a <b>left-hander,</b> and the longest by an AL southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of 49⅔ innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by an AL <b>left-hander</b> since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser's 1945 total of eight.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies <b>left-hander</b> Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the {{historic}} Wrigley Field. He narrowly missed completing a perfect game by walking two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long fly ball hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able to snag the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, who now has tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E
5|$|Frank Lucchesi {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Sounds in 1989, leading the team to a third-place finish with a 74–72record. Pitcher Hugh Kemp set the career franchise records for games started (73) and walks (207) while playing for the team from 1987 to 1989. The Sounds returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season in the American Association, when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' two-run homer {{in the top of}} the eighteenth inning. The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. <b>Left-hander</b> Chris Hammond won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990, having led the league with 15wins and 149strikeouts. That year, Nashville set their all-time attendance record when a total of 605,122fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who played with Nashville in 1979 and from 1988 to 1990, holds three career franchise records: games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Sánchez {{made the}} Giants' {{starting}} rotation out {{of spring training}} as the fifth starter. In only his second start of the season, he struck out a career high ten batters against the San Diego Padres in a game the Giants eventually won 1–0. Sánchez struck out ten batters again in a 3–1 victory against the Cincinnati Reds on April 25, becoming the first Giants left-handed pitcher since Shawn Estes to strike out at least ten batters in a game {{more than once in}} a season. From May 28 through June 12, Sánchez won a career best four straight starts. On June 12, in a 10–7 victory over the Colorado Rockies, he became the first Giants' starter to allow seven runs and win a game since Russ Ortiz did it in 2000. In his next start, on June 17 against the Detroit Tigers, Sánchez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he was ultimately the losing pitcher in a 5–1 loss. Sánchez finished the first half with an 8–5 record and 115 strikeouts, which were the most ever {{in the first half of}} a season by a Giants' <b>left-hander</b> during the Giants' tenure in San Francisco.|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} 203 task naïve left- and {{right-handed}} {{participants were asked}} to complete a combination of the three and four disk Towers of Hanoi (ToH), manipulating novelty and complexity. Self-reported state anxiety and latency to respond (initiation time) were recorded before each ToH. Novelty had a major effect on initiation time, particularly for <b>left-handers.</b> <b>Left-handers</b> had a longer latency to start and this was significantly longer on the first trial. Irrespective of hand-preference, initiation time reduced on the second trial, however this was greatest for <b>left-handers.</b> Condition of task did not systematically influence initiation time for right handers, but did for <b>left-handers.</b> State anxiety was influenced by task novelty and complexity in a more complicated way. During the first trial, there was a significant handedness x number of disks interaction with <b>left-handers</b> having significantly higher state anxiety levels before the three-disk ToH. This suggests that the initial reaction to this task for <b>left-handers</b> was not simply due to perceived difficulty. On their second trial, participants completing a novel ToH had higher state anxiety scores than those completing a repeated version. Overall, <b>left-handers</b> had a larger reduction in their state anxiety across trials. Relating to this, the expected strong positive correlation between state and trait anxiety was absent for left-handed females in their first tower presentation, but appeared on their second. This was driven by low trait anxiety individuals showing a higher state anxiety response in the first (novel) trial, supporting the idea that left-handed females respond to novelty {{in a way that is}} not directly a consequence of their trait anxiety. A possible explanation may be stereotype threat influencing the behaviour of left-handed females...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{differences of}} cerebral activation in 12 right-handed and left-handed participants, respectively, using a sentence-processing task. Functional MRI shows activation of left-frontal and inferior-parietal speech areas (BA 44, BA 9, BA 40) in both groups, but a stronger bilateral activation in <b>left-handers.</b> Direct group comparison reveals a stronger activation in right-frontal cortex (BA 47, BA 6) and left cerebellum in <b>left-handers.</b> Laterality indices for the inferior-frontal cortex are less asymmetric in <b>left-handers</b> {{and are not}} related to the degree of handedness. Thus, our results show that sentence-processing induced enhanced activation involving a bilateral network in left-handed participants...|$|R
50|$|A {{few other}} studies and {{practices}} with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of <b>left-handers</b> being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers.

5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself and went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no <b>left-hander</b> has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant. He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} seasons with White Sox, Pierce's control {{problems}} continued; his 137 walks in 1950 tied {{him for the}} fourth most ever by an AL <b>left-hander.</b> But those seasons also included indications of his developing excellence, {{as well as the}} struggles he would face in gaining run support. On May 29, 1949, in just his sixth start with Chicago (and the 11th of his career), the 22-year-old Pierce was matched against 42-year-old Negro league legend Satchel Paige in a road game against the defending World Series champion Cleveland Indians. The pitchers' duel went into the 11th inning, when Pierce walked leadoff hitter Ken Keltner, followed by two bunt singles. After Pierce was replaced by a reliever and the next batter lined to shortstop Luke Appling, Lou Boudreau singled to give Cleveland a 2–1 win; Pierce had himself scored Chicago's only run after singling in the eighth inning. And on June 15, 1950 against the World Series champion Yankees, Pierce got his first career shutout – a 5–0 one-hitter, interrupted by rain delays in the second, fourth and fifth innings totaling over an hour and a half, with the only hit being Billy Johnson's single in the fifth inning.|$|E
5|$|Alonso lapped {{consistently}} {{in the low}} 1:19 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap of the race on lap41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three <b>left-hander,</b> and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHumans exhibit hand {{preference}} for most manual {{activities in which}} they are specialized. Right- and <b>left-handers</b> have coexisted at least since the Upper Palaeolithic, and <b>left-handers</b> are in the minority in all human populations. The persistence of the polymorphism of handedness is a puzzle because this trait is substantially heritable and several fitness costs are associated with left-handedness. Some countervailing benefit is required to maintain the polymorphism. <b>Left-handers</b> may have a frequency-dependent advantage in fights—the advantage being greater when their frequency is lower. Sports data from Western societies are consistent with this prediction. Here, we show that the frequency of <b>left-handers</b> is strongly and positively correlated with the rate of homicides across traditional societies. It ranges from 3 % in the most pacifistic societies, to 27 % in the most violent and warlike. This finding is consistent with a frequency-dependent selection mechanism maintaining left-handedness in these societies...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Research has {{indicated}} {{a history of}} discrimination against left-handedness, with evidence that many <b>left-handers</b> gave in to social pressure or were forced to use their right hand for certain activities such as writing at school.

5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against <b>left-hander</b> Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held in wet-weather conditions before less rain fell and drivers were required to adapt to changing levels of grip. Full wet tyres {{were used in the}} session's opening period before the field utilised intermediate tyres in its closing minutes. The conditions prevented the teams from collecting data on how the dry-compound tyres would perform. Adrian Sutil was the fastest driver with a time of 1:25.701 seconds, ahead of Massa who spun several times and had the fastest time until Sutil's lap. Jenson Button was third-fastest despite complaining about his car's handling, ahead of Rubens Barrichello (who spun at high-speed at turn three after driving into a large amount of standing water) and Vitaly Petrov. Rosberg and Sébastien Buemi were sixth and seventh-fastest. Nico Hülkenberg, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Hamilton drove over standing water at the exit of the turn three <b>left-hander</b> twenty minutes before the session ended and slid sideways into the turn four tyre barrier, heavily damaging his car.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} {{there are}} anatomical asymmetries {{of the human}} brain associated with right-hand or left-hand preference. In addition, left-handedness has been related {{to a wide range of}} psychological and physical problems. Despite these relationships, little is known about the inner experience of <b>left-handers.</b> The present study, a replication of Mizrachi (2010) using a larger sample, used Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES) with three objectives: 1) examine the inner experience of left-handers; 2) compare the results of the present study to the results of Mizrachi (2010); and 3) compare the inner experience of <b>left-handers</b> to that of the general population as reported by Heavey and Hurlburt (2008). Of 256 volunteers who completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI), 10 identified as being left-handed were invited to participate in the DES sampling of their inner experience. All agreed to do so and engaged in five days of DES sampling. The findings suggest that the inner experience of <b>left-handers</b> is quantitatively and qualitatively different from the inner experience of the general population. <b>Left-handers</b> experience sensory awareness, words experienced without semantic significance, and multiple experience at a substantially higher frequency than the general population. <b>Left-handers</b> experience inner seeing, inner speech, and feeling substantially less than the general population...|$|R
40|$|Widely cited studies {{report an}} excess of <b>left-handers</b> among top athletes (tennis players, cricketers, and fencers) and architects. These {{findings}} are seen as being consistent with the influential theories of Annett (1985) and Geschwind and Galaburda (1985 a, 1985 b, 1985 c) which predict that left handers are over-represented in activities making heavy demands on spatial abilities. This present research reexamined the proportion of <b>left-handers</b> in both sport and architecture. The analyses of sport only found evidence for {{an excess of}} <b>left-handers</b> among cricket bowlers and tennis players and among this latter group the effect was highly capricious. In both sports the rarer <b>left-handers</b> enjoys tactical advantages; {{there is no need}} to invoke neurological explanations. Among the other groups of top athletes examined: soccer goalkeepers, cricket batsmen, ten-pin bowlers, snooker and darts players, and golfers, no evidence was found of an excess of <b>left-handers.</b> Similarly, an analysis of a large group of practicing architects failed to reveal an abnormal proportion of <b>left-handers.</b> As handedness data was obtained from the architects and the soccer goalkeepers using a mail survey an additional study was undertaken to determine whether a mail survey is a valid method of collecting handedness data. This survey failed to find any systematic bias between those who do and do not reply. Thus the findings for goalkeepers and architects are strengthened.

Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the <b>left-hander</b> of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower <b>left-hander</b> of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out <b>left-hander</b> of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a minimum speed of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex.

40|$|Face {{perception}} is highly lateralized {{to the right}} hemisphere (RH) in humans, as supported originally by observations of face recognition impairment (prosopagnosia) following brain damage. Divided visual field presentations, neuroimaging and event-related potential studies have supported this view. While the latter studies are typically performed in right-handers, the few reported cases of prosopagnosia with unilateral left damage were <b>left-handers,</b> suggesting that handedness may shift or qualify the lateralization of face perception. We tested this hypothesis by recording the whole set of face-sensitive areas in 11 <b>left-handers,</b> using a face-localizer paradigm in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) (faces, cars, and their phase-scrambled versions). All face-sensitive areas identified (superior temporal sulcus, inferior occipital cortex, anterior infero-temporal cortex, amygdala) were strongly right-lateralized in <b>left-handers,</b> this right lateralization bias being as large as in a population of right-handers (40) tested with the same paradigm (Rossion et al., 2012). The notable exception was the so-called ‘Fusiform face area’ (FFA), an area that was slightly left lateralized in the population of <b>left-handers.</b> Since the left FFA is localized closely to an area sensitive to word form in the human brain (‘Visual Word Form Area’ – VWFA), the enhanced left lateralization of the FFA in <b>left-handers</b> may be due to a decreased competition with the representation of words. The implications for the neural basis of face perception, aetiology of brain lateralization in general, and prosopagnosia are also discussed...|$|R
