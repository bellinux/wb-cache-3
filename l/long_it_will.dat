25|$|So {{while all}} three {{statements}} are true, progressively {{more information is}} contained in each. In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E
25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up {{a significant portion of}} its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

25|$|A drug's {{distribution}} coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended {{target in the}} body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, and how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> remain in the body in an active form. Hence, the log P of a molecule is one criterion used in decision-making by medicinal chemists in pre-clinical drug discovery, for example, {{in the assessment of}} druglikeness of drug candidates. Likewise, it is used to calculate lipophilic efficiency in evaluating the quality of research compounds, where the efficiency for a compound is defined as its potency, via measured values of pIC50 or pEC50, minus its value of log P.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for <b>long,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} {{standard}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, microscopic phenomena are objectively random. That is, {{in an experiment}} that controls all causally relevant parameters, {{some aspects of the}} outcome still vary randomly. For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take for the atom to decay—only the probability of decay in a given time. Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities. [...] Hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.|$|E

Owen believed his utopian community would create a [...] "superior social, intellectual and physical environment" [...] based on his ideals of social reform. Owen was motivated to buy the town {{in order to prove}} his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community New Lanark. The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fit Owen's needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited [...] "any and all" [...] to join him there. While many of the town's new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted [...] "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely." [...] William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March 24, 1825: [...] "I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when they come here.
