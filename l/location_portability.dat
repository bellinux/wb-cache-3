40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national dialling plan. It clarifies the differences between numbering plans and dialling plans, and shows that the closure of a dialling plan fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: Closing the dialling plan facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when closing the dialling plan. Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of numbering capacity within a numbering plan. Closing the dialling plan may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a dialling plan and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to close its dialling plan, but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries <b>location</b> <b>portability</b> is considered as a voluntary service aspect, closing the dialling plan and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{wireless}} networking {{technology have}} engendered {{a new paradigm}} of computing, called mobile computing, in which users carrying portable devices {{have access to a}} shared infrastructure independent of their physical location. This provides flexible communication between people and continuous access to networked services. Mobile computing is expected to revolutionize the way computers are used. This paper is a survey of the fundamental software design pressures particular to mobile computing. The issues discussed arise from three essential requirements: the use of wireless networking, the ability to change locations, and the need for unencumbered portability. Promising approaches to address these challenges are identified, along with their shortcomings.

40|$|The mobile {{computing}} is a computing {{system in which}} a computer and all necessary accessories like files and software are taken out to the field. It is a system of computing through which it {{is being able to}} use a computing device even when someone being mobile and therefore changing <b>location.</b> The <b>portability</b> is one of the important aspects of {{mobile computing}}. The mobile phones are being used to gather scientific data from remote and isolated places that could not be possible to retrieve by other means. The scientists are initiating to use mobile devices and web-based applications to systematically explore interesting scientific aspects of their surroundings, ranging from climate change, environmental pollution to earthquake monitoring. This mobile revolution enables new ideas and innovations to spread out more quickly and efficiently.

40|$|Telephone {{networks}} are currently facing two major changes that affect routing. Firstly, number portability is gaining popularity. Number portability requires a mapping {{between the number}} dialed by the subscriber and the number used for routing. Secondly, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony is gradually replacing circuit switched telephony. As both technologies must co-exist for several years, a need arises to provide seamless routing between the technologies. This involves the process of locationing the best gateway for each call between the technologies. This licentiate thesis examines the problems of routing, gateway <b>location</b> and number <b>portability</b> in interconnected circuit and packet switched network. The problems and their current solutions are first described and evaluated. We observe that the current solutions address each of these subproblems separately and only in a single technology, while an efficient solution requires that all problems are observed simultaneously. We therefore establish a set of requirements for information distribution and usage of routing addresses. We then propose extensions to existing methods to enable better performance and integration with other methods in a hybrid scenario. Specifically, we examine solutions based on the Domain Name System (DNS), the Telephone Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol, and databases...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{applications}} are earning popularity {{because of the}} significant benefits of smartphones, such as: <b>portability,</b> <b>location</b> awareness, electronic identity, and an integrated camera. Nevertheless, these devices {{have a number of}} disadvantages concerning usability, such as limited resources and small screen size. A number of studies have investigated usability challenges in a mobile context and proposed definitions and measurement of the usability of mobile applications. Evaluating the usability of applications for mobile operating systems is a crucial step in addressing these difficulties and achieving success in mobile application markets, such as Apple’s App Store. Usability evaluation must be tailored to the various mobile operating systems in use, each with its particular characteristics. Apple App Store is the only source for buying or installing iOS applications. Users rate applications in the App Store and take into the account other users’ evaluations when buying an application. Users tend to give higher ratings to the applications that satisfy their functional and non-functional requirements. Usability is one of the non-functional requirements that users consider when they rate applications. Hence, it is important to develop applications with higher usability and better user experience to be successful in the App Store. Apple publishes a guideline named "HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) " and recommends following these guidelines during the design and development of iOS applications. There are also other guidelines that suggest other design principles and heuristics but the Relationship between these guidelines and App Store success is unknown. In addition, there is not any explicit method to predict the success of an application in the App Store. Developers and development companies spend much time to develop an application with little clue about the success of their application in the App Store. This research project combines the guidelines from the literature and proposes an iOS application usability evaluation model to evaluate iOS application usability. It presents next an analysis of the relationship between criteria and application’s App Store user rating by evaluating 99 applications. This research project also proposes a machine learning model to predict the success of an iOS application in the App Store, based on the evaluation method proposed {{in the first part of}} this research...|$|R
40|$|The {{genesis of}} a 3 D model has {{basically}} two definitely different paths. Firstly we can consider the CAD generated models, where the shape is defined {{according to a}} user drawing action, operating with different mathematical “bricks” like B-Splines, NURBS or subdivision surfaces (mathematical CAD modelling), or directly drawing small polygonal planar facets in space, approximating with them complex free form shapes (polygonal CAD modelling). This approach {{can be used for}} both ideal elements (a project, a fantasy shape in the mind of a designer, a 3 D cartoon, etc.) or for real objects. In the latter case the object has to be first surveyed in order to generate a drawing coherent with the real stuff. If the surveying process is not only a rough acquisition of simple distances with a substantial amount of manual drawing, a scene can be modelled in 3 D by capturing with a digital instrument many points of its geometrical features and connecting them by polygons to produce a 3 D result similar to a polygonal CAD model, with the difference that the shape generated is in this case an accurate 3 D acquisition of a real object (reality-based polygonal modelling). Considering only device operating on the ground, 3 D capturing techniques for the generation of reality-based 3 D models may span from passive sensors and image data (Remondino and El-Hakim, 2006), optical active sensors and range data (Blais, 2004; Shan & Toth, 2008; Vosselman and Maas, 2010), classical surveying (e. g. total stations or Global Navigation Satellite System - GNSS), 2 D maps (Yin et al., 2009) or an integration of the aforementioned methods (Stumpfel et al., 2003; Guidi et al., 2003; Beraldin, 2004; Stamos et al., 2008; Guidi et al., 2009 a; Remondino et al., 2009; Callieri et al., 2011). The choice depends on the required resolution and accuracy, object dimensions, <b>location</b> constraints, instrument’s <b>portability</b> and usability, surface characteristics, working team experience, project’s budget, final goal, etc. Although aware of the potentialities of the image-based approach and its recent developments in automated and dense image matching for non-expert the easy usability and reliability of optical active sensors in acquiring 3 D data is generally a good motivation to decline image-based approaches. Moreover the great advantage of active sensors is the fact that they deliver immediately dense and detailed 3 D point clouds, whose coordinate are metrically defined. On the other hand image data require some processing and a mathematical formulation to transform the two-dimensional image measurements into metric three-dimensional coordinates. Image-based modelling techniques (mainly photogrammetry and computer vision) are generally preferred in cases of monuments or architectures with regular geometric shapes, low budget projects, good experience of the working team, time or location constraints for the data acquisition and processing. This chapter is intended as an updated review of reality-based 3 D modelling in terrestrial applications, with the different categories of 3 D sensing devices and the related data processing pipelines...|$|R
