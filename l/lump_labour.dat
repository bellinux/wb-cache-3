50|$|The <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy {{has been}} applied to {{concerns}} around immigration and labour. Given a fixed availability of employment, the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> position argues that allowing immigration of working-age people reduces the availability of work for native-born workers ("they are taking our jobs").|$|R
50|$|In economics, the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy is {{the idea}} that there is a fixed amount of work—a lump of labour—to be done within an economy which can be {{distributed}} to create more or fewer jobs. It was considered a fallacy in 1891 by economist David Frederick Schloss, who held that the amount of work is not fixed.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{underlying}} premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The {{one that}} has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether {{or not it is}} a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which {{is that there is a}} finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy, arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any <b>lump</b> of <b>labour.</b> In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the [...] "easy" [...] work, (2) the definition of what is [...] "easy" [...] expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond [...] "easy" [...] (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011, Kamm {{wrote in}} the New Statesman that he {{supports}} the Euro and admonishes Labour's recent criticisms of it: [...] "Monetary union is {{not the cause of}} the crisis. Done properly, it may help insulate member states from disruptive volatility in the international capital markets". He criticised Ed Miliband's stand on immigration before the 2015 general election, finding the Labour leader's position decidedly illiberal. He believes current controls are far too tight, that immigration is economically beneficial, and such arguments against incomers are based on the <b>Lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy.|$|R
50|$|Further {{reductions}} in working hours {{have been proposed}} as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including John R. Commons, Lord Keynes and Luigi Pasinetti. Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value engaging in work for its own sake. Generally, 20th-century economists had argued against further reductions {{as a solution to}} unemployment, saying it reflects a <b>Lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy.In 2014, Google's co-founder, Larry Page, suggested a four-day workweek, so as technology continues to displace jobs, more people can find employment.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the “lump of labor” {{assumption}} fails in Italy. The direct relationship between the unemployment rate of {{the young and the}} labor force participation of the old is pro-cyclical, i. e. a higher labor force participation of the old is related to a lower unemployment rate of the young. Hence both vary with the business cycle. In order to overcome endogeneity problems in explaining unemployment of the young, we resort to a simulated variable: “the inducement to retire”, which is constructed by simulating the social security benefits. We related the unemployment rate of the young to this incentive measure and find that a higher inducement to retire is associated to a higher unemployment rate – quite the opposite of the “young-in-old-out” story. <b>lump</b> of <b>labour,</b> youth unemployment, early retirement...|$|R
5000|$|Related to {{experiences}} with resource-scarce environments {{is the belief}} that a resource is scarce or finite. For example, the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> fallacy refers to the belief that in the economy there is a fixed amount of work to be done, and thus the allocation of jobs is zero-sum. Similarly, there {{is the belief that}} the amount of wealth in the economy is fixed, and so when some individuals become more wealthy, it is {{at the expense of others}} (because there is assumed to be no growth in the [...] "pie"). Although the belief that a resource is scarce might develop through {{experiences with}} resource scarcity, this is not necessarily the case. For example, individuals might come to believe that wealth is finite because it is a claim that has been repeated by politicians or journalists.|$|R
50|$|The book is {{intended}} to clarify core ideas in economics which he feels are systematically misunderstood. As in The efficient society, Heath argues {{that the government should}} operate only in markets where a collective action problem occurs and not in markets where this problem is absent (where it is a race to the bottom not a race to the top). In these good-competition markets Heath defends price gouging, outsourcing and free trade (criticizing price-fixing, trade protectionism and fair trade). In bad-competition markets Heath argues that by risk-pooling the government provides a natural and optimal solution for everyone. He defends the free market against the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> argument, arguing that increases in efficiency are win-win situations despite job loss and other consequences. Likewise he describes international trade as non-exploitative. Trade specialization increases efficiency thereby increasing the price value of one's labour. This is because the price value of labour {{is a function of the}} efficiency of an economy.|$|R
60|$|All {{hands were}} needed, {{and after a}} day or two Kit's muscles ached and his bruised hands bled. When his limbs were cramped by {{crawling}} among the timbers in the hold, he went off in the boat, and clasping a fifty-six-pound <b>lump</b> of iron <b>laboured</b> up the hammered beach. Sometimes a roller, frothing round his waist, urged him on, and sometimes he stopped and braced himself against the backwash. The bottom was not firm; gravel and sand rolled up and down and buried his sinking feet. Moreover, he knew the iron he laboriously carried up must all be carried back.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{previous}} book The Lexus and the Olive Tree, Friedman argued that no two nations with a McDonald's franchise had ever {{gone to war}} with one another: this {{was known as the}} Golden Arches theory. Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the [...] "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" [...] by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the <b>lump</b> of the <b>labour</b> sector that is created by globalization. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to address}} the issue of public pension reforms under {{demographic}} ageing that is likely to occur in Europe over the next 50 years. Three possible scenarios are analysed in a Blanchard OLG framework. These include: i) a decrease both in public pensions and the <b>lump</b> sum <b>labour</b> income tax, ii) a decrease both in public pensions and the distortionary corporate tax, iii) an increase in the retirement age. The analysis focuses on the effects of these fiscal policies on key economic variables such as consumption, private and public debt, output and wages. Quantitative experiments assess the impact of different fiscal policies in terms of public debt sustainability but most importantly suggest policies that smooth the transition of the economy to the new equilibrium. The main results suggest that the adverse effects of pension reforms on consumption are moderated when they are accompanied by appropriate taxation policies. In particular, when the tax response is rapid most of the adverse movement in consumption is avoided while public and national debt reach lower equilibrium levels.

40|$|It is {{important}} to note that the negative development on the Gulf States' labour market cannot be attributed to differences in the size of the working age population or the participation rates among working age people. Hence, it would be wrong to argue that labour supply has risen so much in the Gulf, no wonder that labour demand could not expand by an equivalent amount. An extreme version of this thinking is reflected in the folly notion of a <b>lump</b> sum of <b>labour</b> which argues that unemployment can only be solved by dividing more equally among workers a given pie of labour demand. This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of indigenous problems and their impact on aggregate equilibrium unemployment and social welfare. The paper seeks to diagnose the problem in the six GCC states and suggests some method somewhat connected with a scheme for enhancing social welfare whereby to rectify the current situation with policy implications deemed appropriate for the current situation. ...|$|R
30|$|Those {{results were}} {{confirmed}} by the recent OECD Employment Outlook (2013), where an instrumental variable estimator was used in a longitude cross country comparison {{to get rid of}} possible omitting variable bias. Instead of employment rates of older people life expectancy was used since it is assumed to be correlated with old people’s employment rates but not with the employment rate of young people. They found no significant correlation between life expectation and the employment rate of young people. Moreover, Jousten et al. 2010, Salem et al. 2010 or Murphy and Welch 1992 also used longitude data within countries and emphasized weak substitutability between young and old workers.If we examine the correlation between youth unemployment rate and exit rates from the labour market of the elderly by gender, an interesting result emerges. The overall exit rate of the elderly, which measures the proportion of male and female elderly workers leaving the labour market, is uncorrelated to the youth unemployment rate among the females (see Figure 3 Panel (d)). However, a positive correlation (statistically significant at the 10 % level) emerges between the overall exit rate of the elderly and the male youth unemployment rate, as shown at Figure 3 Panel (e), with this finding overturning the <b>lump</b> of <b>labour</b> view.In the local (regional) labour market, in which the elderly retire early – and thus exit the labour market – the unemployment rate of the young males is high, whereas lower level of youth unemployment rate for males are associated with low exit rates among the elderly. To further pursue the possibility of gender specific jobs, in which substitutability between young and elderly (male or female) workers occurs, we analyse the exit rate of the elderly and the unemployment rate of the young by gender. While no correlation emerges for females (see Figure 3 Panel (b)), a strong positive correlation becomes apparent between the elderly male exit rate and young males’ unemployment rate, as displayed in Figure 3 Panel (c).|$|R
