50|$|The {{endocrine}} system is affected largely by many {{internal and external}} stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes hormone release is blood pressure. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is a large driving force {{for the release of}} vasopressin, a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individuals thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. Hypovolemia, or <b>low</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.|$|R

40|$|For {{electrophysiological}} {{studies in}} the fly's optic lobe, a procedure was required to perfuse the brain at controllable rates with oxygenated solutions, while recording intracellularly from visual interneurons. The cornea of the compound eyes has to be left in air, {{in order not to}} disturb their optics, and to allow physiological stimulation. When the head capsule is opened to get acces to the brain, air sacs and major tracheal trunks tend to collapse by either of two causes: surface tension may flatten tracheae at too <b>low</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> and hydrostatic pressure may flatten tracheae at too high levels. Only within a small range of saline levels (< ± 30 µm) main tracheae and air sacs were found to remain inflated in the dissected head. Therefore the saline level had to be precisely controlled and stabilized within a few microns. With this procedure, it is possible to maintain the fly's brain (< 5 µl) alive for more than 24 hrs in a perfused volume of only 15 µl, and to record intracellularly from fibres as small as 2 µm. The same procedure should be applicable wherever small, open volumes have to be precisely perfused, and mechanical or electrical artifacts cannot be tolerated. ...|$|R

40|$|Gravity driven {{hydraulic}} flocculators {{that operate}} {{in the absence of}} reliable electric power are better suited to meet the water treatment needs of communities in the global south than conventional mechanical flocculators. However, current knowledge regarding the proper design and operation of hydraulic flocculation systems is insufficient. Of particular interest to the AguaClara research team is the optimal <b>fluid</b> shear <b>level</b> needed to produce low turbidity water. The Flocculation Residual Turbidity Analyzer (FReTA) was developed as tool for measuring the floc sedimentation velocity distribution and the post-sedimentation residual turbidity of a flocculated suspension. These two properties are central to the design and operation of unit processes following flocculation in a water treatment plant. FReTA measures the turbidity of a flocculent suspension undergoing quiescent sedimentation. The fixed distance across which flocs must travel to clear the measurement volume in FReTA allows sedimentation velocities to be calculated from the raw turbidity data. By fitting the transformed turbidity data with a modified gamma distribution, the mean and variance of the sedimentation velocity distribution can be obtained along with the post-sedimentation residual turbidity. A hydraulic tube flocculator was used to study how <b>fluid</b> shear <b>levels</b> affect the settling properties of a flocculated alum-kaolin suspension. FReTA was employed to quantitatively compare the effects of varying fluid shear and hydraulic residence time on the sedimentation velocity distributions and the post-sedimentation residual turbidities of flocculated suspensions formed in the tube flocculator. Results showed that shear induced floc break up occurred at all velocity gradients evaluated. There was a correlation between high floc settling velocities and low residual turbidities, both of which were optimized at <b>low</b> <b>fluid</b> shear <b>levels</b> and long <b>fluid</b> residence times. This study showed that, for hydraulic flocculation systems, low turbidity water was produced when fluid shear was kept at a minimum...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{two dimensional}} binary and ternary amphiphilic fluids under flow conditions is investigated using a hydrodynamic lattice gas model. After the {{validation of the}} model in simple cases (Poiseuille flow, Darcy's law for single component fluids), attention is focussed on the properties of binary immiscible fluids in porous media. An extension of Darcy's law which explicitly admits a viscous coupling between the fluids is verified, and evidence of capillary effects are described. The influence of a third component, namely surfactant, is studied in the same context. Invasion simulations have also been performed. The effect of the applied force on the invasion process is reported. As the forcing level increases, the invasion process becomes faster and the residual oil saturation decreases. The introduction of surfactant in the invading phase during imbibition produces new phenomena, including emulsification and micellisation. At very <b>low</b> <b>fluid</b> forcing <b>levels,</b> {{this leads to the}} production of a low-resistance gel, which then slows down the progress of the invading fluid. At long times (beyond the water percolation threshold), the concentration of remaining oil within the porous medium is lowered by the action of surfactant, thus enhancing oil recovery. On the other hand, the introduction of surfactant in the invading phase during drainage simulations slows down the invasion process [...] the invading fluid takes a more tortuous path to invade the porous medium [...] and reduces the oil recovery (the residual oil saturation increases).

40|$|The rotating-wall perfused-vessel (RWPV) bioreactor, {{used for}} both {{microgravity}} and Earth-based cell science experiments, is characterized {{in terms of}} the fluid dynamic and fluid shear stress environment. A numerical model of the flow field is developed and verified with laser Doppler velocimeter measurements. The effects of changes in operating conditions, including rotation rates and fluid perfusion rates, are investigated with the numerical model. The operating conditions typically used for ground-based experiments (equal rotation of the inner and outer cylinders) leads to flow patterns with relatively poor mass distribution characteristics. Approximately 50 % of the inlet-perfused fluid bypasses the bulk of the fluid volume and flows to the perfusion exit. For operating conditions typical in microgravity, small differential rotation rates between the inner and outer cylinders lead to greatly improved flow distribution patterns and very <b>low</b> <b>fluid</b> shear stress <b>levels</b> over {{a large percentage of the}} fluid volume.

To address this question the synthesis and secretion of cystatin C in cultured monocytes from 9 carriers of the mutated cystatin C gene (5 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic) was examined. The quantity of cystatin C in cells and supernatants {{was determined by the}} ELISA method, Western blots were done and selected samples immunostained for cystatin C. Monocytes from individuals carrying the gene defect synthesized cystatin C that was apparently not truncated, a form found in the cerebral amyloid deposits in HCCAA, but showed a distinctly lower rate of cystatin C synthesis than monocytes from healthy controls. The main difference was that the quantity of cystatin C was significantly lower in the supernatants in monocyte cultures from carriers of the gene defect than from healthy controls, possibly due to a partial block in its secretion. This abnormal processing of the cystatin C could explain the <b>low</b> cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of cystatin C in HCCAA and might {{be a part of the}} pathogenetic pathway of amyloid deposition.

40|$|Folate {{transport}} {{to the brain}} depends on ATP-driven folate receptor-mediated transport across choroid plexus epithelial cells. Failure of ATP production in Kearns-Sayre syndrome syndrome provides one explanation for the finding of <b>low</b> spinal <b>fluid</b> (CSF) 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF) levels in this condition. Therefore, we suspect the presence of reduced folate transport across the blood-spinal fluid barrier in other mitochondrial encephalopathies. In the present patient with mitochondrial complex I encephalomyopathy a low 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate level {{was found in the}} CSF. Serum folate receptor autoantibodies were negative and could not explain the <b>low</b> spinal <b>fluid</b> folate <b>levels.</b> The epileptic seizures did not respond to primidone monotherapy, but addition of ubiquinone- 10 and radical scavengers reduced seizure frequency. Add-on treatment with folinic acid led to partial clinical improvement including full control of epilepsy, followed by marked recovery from demyelination of the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia and white matter. Cerebral folate deficiency is not only present in Kearns-Sayre syndrome but may also be secondary to the failure of mitochondrial ATP production in other mitochondrial encephalopathies.

However, gliomas grossly appearing to arise in the lepto-meninges are rare, and may assume one of two forms: (1) the meningeal tumour may be entirely extracerebral and have no demonstrable connexion with the underlying neuraxis, or (2) it may grow largely in the subarachnoid space, but with definite connexions to the superficial layers of the adjacent cortex. An example of the second type is offered in the present case, where a well-differentiated astro-cytoma was grossly identifiable only in the sub-arachnoid space of the right Sylvian fissure, but microscopically it extended into the cerebral peri-vascular spaces and invaded the cerebral cortex through breaks in the adventitia-glia membranes.

40|$|The sleep {{disorder}} narcolepsy is {{now considered}} a neurodegenerative disease {{because there is a}} massive loss of neurons containing the neuropeptide hypocretin/orexin (HCRT). In consequence, narcoleptic patients have very <b>low</b> cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> (CSF) <b>levels</b> of HCRT. Studies in animal models of narcolepsy have shown the neurophysiological role of the HCRT system in the development of this disease. For example, the injection of the neurotoxin named hypocretin- 2 -saporin (HCRT 2 /SAP) into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) destroys the HCRT neurons, therefore diminishes the contents of HCRT in the CSF and induces narcoleptic-like behavior in rats. Transplants of various cell types have been used to induce recovery in a variety of neurodegenerative animal models. In models such as Parkinson’s disease, cell survival {{has been shown to be}} small but satisfactory. Similarly, cell transplantation could be employed to implant grafts of HCRT cells into the LH or even other brain regions to treat narcolepsy.
