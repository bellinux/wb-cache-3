25|$|Three years later, {{war broke}} out east of the Jordan River, and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover Ramoth-Gilead from the Arameans. During this battle, Ahab {{disguised}} himself, but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons, Ahaziah and Jehoram.|$|E
25|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift {{up a piece of}} paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener.|$|E

25|$|There are {{potential}} health hazards in wound licking due to infection risk, especially in immunocompromised patients. Human saliva contains {{a wide variety}} of bacteria that are harmless in the mouth, but that may cause significant infection if introduced into a wound. A notable case was a diabetic man who <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> bleeding thumb following a minor bicycle accident, and subsequently had to have the thumb amputated after it became infected with Eikenella corrodens from his saliva. The practice of metzitzah during circumcision is controversial as it can transmit the herpes virus to the infant.|$|E
500|$|II [...] This {{has been}} {{suggested}} because there were historical accounts reporting that, in regards to Claudius actually accepting the food laced with the lethal poison, things did not go exactly to plan; this could imply a variety of things: Claudius might first have touched the poisoned food and <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> fingers, or might otherwise only have consumed {{a portion of the}} dose of poison needed to be lethal. Those who implicate that a second dose was required claim that he fell into a stupor, threw up, woke up, only to be administered another dose that was then lethal.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who {{was sitting}} beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> plate. The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E

2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while he was asleep. Before she testified about it, {{she turned to the}} jury and said, [...] "please don't judge me." [...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy and <b>licked</b> <b>his</b> hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E
