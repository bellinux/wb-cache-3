The objectives are to find out: (1) the difference between serpentinization and <b>laterization,</b> and (2) the causing factors of <b>laterization.</b> 	The research was conducted through several stages of ex post facto quantitative method, including: (1) field analysis and mapping; and (2) mineralogy analysis: microscopy polarization, serpentinization analysis: SEM EDX, and <b>laterization</b> analysis: XRF. 	The results indicated that serpentinization altered olivine mineral to form silica and magnesium oxide in dark green, light green, brownish green, grayish white and brownish white ultramafic rocks. The serpentinization was started with olivine alteration to form serpentine, antigorite, lizardite, talc; and finalized {{with the formation of}} brucite and magnetite. Serpentinization influenced the reduction of silica and magnesium oxide concentrations in ultramafic rocks, while silica influenced the concentration of nickel oxide on saprolite layers. <b>Laterization</b> altered the levels of silica, nickel oxide, magnesium oxide, and iron oxide; and was influenced by soil water and surface water.

Many magnesite veins are observed, with characteristics indicating that they were emplaced during pervasive top-to-the-southwest shear deformation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{weathering}} of mantle peridotite tectoni-cally {{exposed to}} the atmosphere leads commonly to natural carbonation processes. Extensive cryptocrystalline mag-nesite veins and stock-work are widespread in the ser-pentinite sole of the New Caledonia ophiolite. Silica is systematically associated with magnesite. It is commonly admitted that Mg and Si are released during the <b>laterization</b> of overlying peridotites. Thus, the occurrence of these veins is generally attributed to a per descensum mechanism that involves the infiltration of meteoric waters enriched in dissolved atmospheric CO 2.

The relationships between serpen-tine and alteration products are described using an original method {{for the analysis of}} micro-X-ray fluorescence images performed at the centimeter scale. Our investigations highlight a carbonation mechanism, together with precipitation of amorphous silica and sepiolite, based on a dis-solution–precipitation process. In contrast with the per descensum Mg/Si-enrichment model that is mainly concentrated in rock fractures, dissolution–precipitation process is much more pervasive.

Three of these sections show an irregular alternation of kaolinite rich sandy and silty-clay beds. The fourth section which contains calcareous layers, is very important from a geological point of view, because it is located where the structures of two ranges, the Iberian and the Betics, converge. The clays of about 80 samples from these sections always consist of illite, kaolinite and interstratified clay minerals. The sandy layers also Contain quartz, as well as potash and calcic-sodic felspars. The fine fraction (< 2 #m) is composed of kaolinte, between pM and T types, swelling illite and randomly interstratified clay minerals of the t~) pe (10 r 14 ~), richer in 10 A layers.

However, in working on EEG, the pool of data is gargantuan, thus, wastage in resources and time if optimal electrode placement is not identified. Typically, EEG signals are processed and presented in time or frequency domain, without visual information. Here, this study intends; 1) to determine an optimal set of EEG electrode placement along relaxation and reading-writing neural pathway for normal and dyslexic, 2) to illustrate an EEGbased time and spatial interpretation of activated brain areas, 3) to study the correspondence between the 2 D EEG topography and those from fMRI imaging, being the first attempt ever reported. Target population are normal adults (aged 18 to 25), normal HighlQ children, normal AveragelQ children, dyslexic Capable children and dyslexic Poor children (aged 6 to 12). The EEG signals are recorded with electrodes at activation areas along the documented signal pathway of the brain during state of relaxation and reading-writing tasks. FFT is applied to transform the EEG in time domain into frequency domain and visualization of 2 D-EEG topography is generated through EEGLab and Open Vibe. Results show that the frequency range of EEG recorded from these electrode during relaxation is 8 - 13 Hz for all subjects, while that during writing are 13 - 29 Hz for normal adults, normal HighlQ and dyslexic Capable children, within the sub-bands known for the different neural activities accordingly. These findings conclude that electrodes C 3 /C 4, P 3 /P 4, T 7 /T 8 and FC 5 /FC 6 are suitable as optimal EEG electrode placement for comparison between normal and dyslexic children during reading-writing. Additionally, findings on <b>laterization</b> found that normal HighlQ children clearly highlighted on the left hemisphere, while neural activities of dyslexic Capable children are higher on the right hemisphere and dyslexic Poor children engaged in both left and right hemisphere of the brain. Despite difficulty in finding brain images of the same task and protocol, {{it is found that}} 2 D EEG topography matched with fMRI brain images from previous research...|$|E
40|$|Ultramafic rocks, mainly serpentinized peridotites of mantle origin, {{are mostly}} {{associated}} with the ophiolites of Mesozoic age that occur in belts along three of {{the margins of the}} Caribbean plate. The most extensive exposures are in Cuba. The ultramafic-mafic association (ophiolites) were formed and emplaced in several different tectonic environments. Mineralogical studies of the ultramafic rocks and the chemistry of the associated mafic rocks indicate that most of the ultramafic-mafic associations in both the northern and southern margins of the plate were formed in arc-related environments. There is little mantle peridotite exposed in the ophiolitic associations of the west coast of Central America, in the south Caribbean in Curacao and in the Andean belts in Colombia. In these occurrences the chemistry and age of the mafic rocks indicates that this association is mainly part of the 89 Ma Caribbean plateau province. The age of the mantle peridotites and associated ophiolites is probably mainly late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous. Emplacement of the ophiolites possibly began in the Early Cretaceous in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, but most emplacement took place in the Late Cretaceous to Eocene (e. g. Cuba). Along the northern South America plate margin, in the Caribbean mountain belt, emplacement was by major thrusting and probably was not completed until the Oligocene or even the early Miocene. Caribbean mantle peridotites, before serpentinization, were mainly harzburgites, but dunites and lherzolites are also present. In detail, the mineralogical and chemical composition varies even within one ultramafic body, reflecting melting processes and peridotite/melt interaction in the upper mantle. At least for the northern Caribbean, uplift (postemplacement tectonics) exposed the ultramafic massifs as a land surface to effective <b>laterization</b> {{in the beginning of the}} Miocene. Tectonic factors, determining the uplift, exposing the peridotites to weathering varied. In the northern Caribbean, in Guatemala, Jamaica, and Hispaniola, uplift occurred as a result of transpresional movement along pre-existing major faults. In Cuba, uplift occurred on a regional scale, determined by isostatic adjustment. In the south Caribbean, uplift of the Cordillera de la Costa and Serrania del Interior exposing the peridotites, also appears to be related to strike-slip movement along the El Pilar fault system. In the Caribbean, Ni-laterite deposits are currently being mined in the central Dominican Republic, eastern Cuba, northern Venezuela and northwest Colombia. Although apparently formed over ultramafic rocks of similar composition and under similar climatic conditions, the composition of the lateritic soils varies. Factors that probably determined these differences in laterite composition are geomorphology, topography, drainage and tectonics. According to the mineralogy of principal ore-bearing phases, Dominican Ni-laterite deposits are classified as the hydrous silicate-type. The main Ni-bearing minerals are hydrated Mg-Ni silicates (serpentine and ¿garnierite¿) occurring deeper in the profile (saprolite horizon). In contrast, in the deposits of eastern Cuba, the Ni and Cooccurs mainly in the limonite zone composed of Fe hydroxides and oxides as the dominant mineralogy in the upper part of the profile, and are classified as the oxide-type...|$|E
