40|$|Abstract: The {{efficiency}} of the two microbial control agents Nomuraea rileyi and Isaria fumosorosea, were evaluated against Bemisia tabaci and Myzus persicae pests in tomato cultivations The safety levels of the agents, to the predator Coccinella undecimpunctata, were also studied under laboratory and field conditions. Results showed that under laboratory conditions, LC 50 values for N. rileyi and I. fumosorosea were 103. 7 x 104 and 139. 4 x 104 spores/ml against B. tabaci, respectively, while the corresponding values for M. persicae were 89. 1 x 104 and 149. 8 x 104 spores/ml, respectively. Under the field conditions, the percentages of infested plants with B. tabaci and M. persicae were significantly decreased after treatments with both fungi {{as compared with the}} corresponding controls. At the El-Esraa farm (Nobaria region), the weights of the tomato yield were 2, 417 and 2, 911 kg/feddan when I. fumosorosea and N. rileyi were applied respectively, as compared with 2, 010 kg/feddan in the corresponding controls. The corresponding yields in El-Kassaseen were 2, 699 and 2, 999 kg/feddan, respectively, as compared to 1, 990 kg/feddan in the control.

40|$|Ethanol {{stimulated the}} leakage of amino acids and 260 -nm-light-absorbing {{compounds}} from cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The efflux followed first-order kinetics over an initial period. In {{the presence of}} <b>lethal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of ethanol, the efflux rates at 30 and 36 °C were an exponential function of ethanol concentration: keX = keXmeE (X-Xm), where keX and keXm are the efflux rate constants, respectively, {{in the presence of}} a <b>concentration</b> <b>X</b> of ethanol or the minimal concentration of ethanol, Xm, above which the equation was applicable, coincident with the minimal <b>lethal</b> <b>concentration</b> of ethanol. E is the enhancement constant. At 36 °C, as compared with the corresponding values at 30 °C, the efflux rates were higher and the minimal concentration of ethanol (Xm) was lower. The exponential constants for the enhancement of the rate of leakage (E) had similar values at 30 or 36 °C and were of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding exponential constants for ethanol-induced death. Under isothermic conditions (30 °C) and up to 22 % (vol/vol) ethanol, the resistance to ethanol-induced leakage of 260 -nm-light-absorbing compounds was found to be closely related with the ethanol tolerance of three strains of yeasts, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Saccharomyces bayanus. The resistance to ethanol-induced leakage indicates the possible adoption of the present method for the rapid screening of ethanol-tolerant strains. The addition to a fermentation medium of the intracellular material obtained by ethanol permeabilization of yeast cells led to improvements in alcohol fermentation by S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. The action of the intracellular material, by improving yeast ethanol tolerance, and the advantages of partially recycling the fermented medium after distillation were discussed...|$|R
