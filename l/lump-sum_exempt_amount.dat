40|$|This thesis {{examines}} key {{aspects of}} one of the more controversial questions in tax policywhat is the appropriate way to tax capital gains? The focus of the thesis is the capital gains tax (CGT) rate and rate preferences. The research is by way of a review of the relevant tax literature on capital gains, followed by qualitative and quantitative studies and recommendations and conclusions. The literature review identifies an absence of empirical evidence on how Australian personal taxpayers respond to CGT rate changes. This significant gap in the knowledge is the primary motivation for this thesis. The qualitative study presents findings from in-depth interviews conducted with 24 CGT experts in Australia, Canada and the United States on issues related to the taxation of capital gains. In particular, it explores the role of CGT preferences. The interview data are compared with relevant tax literature as well as current practices in the three jurisdictions in taxing capital gains. The study establishes that most interviewees do not support CGT rate preferences. Armed with this background, the quantitative study uses regression analysis to estimate the capital gains realisations response in Australia, with the tax rate change of interest being the enactment of the 50 % CGT discount in 1999 for personal taxpayers. The elasticity point estimates from the quantitative study support the primary hypothesis: that the 50 % CGT discount has caused a decrease in CGT revenue. More specifically, the estimates imply CGT revenue losses. This raises questions about the central rationale for the introduction of the CGT discountthe forecast increase in CGT revenue. The qualitative and quantitative results are drawn on to recommend a tax policy reform to improve the operation of the CGT regime in Australia. Specifically, reinstating taxation of personal capital gains at marginal rates and introducing an annual <b>exempt</b> <b>amount</b> for net capital gains...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of aspects of tax design on the {{operating}} costs of the tax system. The thesis focuses on the Australian and UK regimes for taxing the capital gains of individuals. It contends that the compliance burden faced by personal taxpayers and the administrative costs incurred by revenue authorities are directly influenced by {{the design of the}} capital gains tax ('CGT') regimes in each country. The study bridges the divide between theoretical analysis of CGT and empirical studies on tax operating costs. It uses a hybrid research design to test a series of hypotheses that emerge from {{a review of the literature}} and the experience of the researcher. It combines a technical analysis of the relevant Australian and UK legislative provisions (including an analysis of the policy and other background data that underpins those provisions) with empirical research on the views and experience of practitioners who are responsible for the operation of the legislation in the two countries. The results obtained from this combined methodology indicate that the operating costs of taxing capital gains in Australia and the UK are directly affected by the design of the legislative provisions. Moreover, the study outcomes indicate that operating costs in both countries are high (on a number of comparative measures), have not reduced over time, and are both horizontally and vertically inequitable. The research indicates that the primary factors that cause the high operating costs include the complexity of the legislation and the frequency of legislative change, together with record-keeping and valuation requirements. The thesis identifies specific legislative changes that would address operational cost concerns. These include the phasing out of the 'grandfathering' exemption together with the introduction of an annual <b>exempt</b> <b>amount,</b> and the rationalisation of business concessions in Australia; and the abolition of taper relief and its possible replacement with a 50 % exclusion in the UK. More importantly, it seeks a more principled approach to the taxation of capital gains in both countries, and emphasises that legislative change can and should only be enacted with a full and clear understanding of the operating cost implications of that change...|$|R

This paper assesses the key {{features of the}} 2002 proposals: green box provisions, blue box provisions, de minimis exemptions, {{the starting point for}} reductions, the nature of the reduction commitment, the depth of cuts, the implementation period for cuts, down payments, overall caps, and special and differential treatment of developing countries. The maximum distorting support (the sum of the maximum de minimis support and any entitlement to AMS or Total AMS that remains after reduction) is calculated for the United States, the European Union, Brazil, and Canada, based on projected values of production at the end point of implementation. The 2002 proposals of the United States, Canada and the Cairns Group are similar in seeking to reduce or eliminate blue box support and to reduce support over five years in developed countries. The proposal of the Cairns Group is found to be extremely ambitious, allowing no support other than green box support in developed countries, combined with a reduced scope for exempting support on green box grounds. Developing countries could still provide distorting support up to de minimis levels. Canada's proposal would also require the elimination of AMS entitlements but is less extreme in that all Members could provide deminimis support as under present rules. Canada's proposal would improve the classification of green box and non-product-specific support, make green box support immune to the threat of countervail, and cap the sum of amber, blue and some green support. The U. S. proposal is found to be only modestly ambitious, perpetuating Members' AMS entitlements, albeit at lower, more harmonized levels. No change is proposed in the rules for classifying support in the green box or as non-product-specific versus product-specific, which would continue to <b>exempt</b> large <b>amounts</b> from commitment. The Cairns Group proposal would extend considerable leeway to developing countries as special and differential treatment, while the Canadian and U. S. proposals seek to discipline distorting support wherever it is provided. Altogether, Canada's proposal would appear to be more practical and more equitable and hence perhaps more effective than the proposals of the Cairns Group and the United States in bringing about substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.

5000|$|The {{inheritance}} tax, {{which is}} also known as the [...] "gift tax", has been altered in the Post-World War II era as well. First established in 1932 as a means to raise tax revenue from the wealthiest Americans, the inheritance tax was put at a nominal rate of 25% points lower than the estate tax which meant its effective rate was 18.7%. Its exemption, up to $50,000, was the same as the estate tax exemption. Under current law, individuals can give gifts of up to $13,000 without incurring a tax and couples can poll their gift together to give a gift of up to $26,000 a year without incurring a tax. The lifetime gift tax exemption is $5 million which is the same amount as the estate tax exemption. These two exemptions are directly tied to each other as the <b>amount</b> <b>exempted</b> from one reduces the amount that can be exempted from the other at a 1:1 ratio. The inheritance/gift tax generally affects {{a very small percentage of}} the population as most citizens do not inherit anything from their deceased relatives in any given year. In 2000, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland published a report that found that 1.6% of Americans received an inheritance of $100,000 or more and an additional 1.1% received an inheritance worth $50,000 to $100,000 while 91.9% of Americans did not receive an inheritance. A 2010 report conducted by Citizens for Tax Justice found that only 0.6% of the population would pass on an inheritance in the event of death in that fiscal year. Accordingly, data shows that inheritance taxes are a tax almost exclusively on the wealthy. In 1986, Congress enacted legislation to prevent trust funds of wealthy individuals from skipping a generation before taxes had to be paid on the inheritance.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{an issue}} {{central to the}} economic and political development of the early United States: laws protecting real property from the claims of creditors. Traditional English law, protecting inheritance, shielded a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s land from the reach of creditors in two respects. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s freehold interest in land was exempted from the claims of unsecured creditors both during life and in inheritance proceedings. In addition, even when land had been explicitly pledged as collateral in mortgage agreements, chancery court procedures imposed substantial costs on creditors using legal process to seize the land. American property law, however, emerged in the context of colonialism and the dynamics of the Atlantic economy. In 1732, to advance the economic interests of English merchants, Parliament enacted a sweeping statute, the Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts in His Majesty 2 ̆ 7 s Plantations and Colonies in America, which required that real property, houses, and slaves be treated as legally equivalent to chattel property for the purpose of satisfying debts in all of the British colonies in America and the West Indies. This statute substantially dismantled the legal framework of the English inheritance system by giving unsecured creditors priority to a deceased 2 ̆ 7 s land over heirs. The Act also required that the courts hold auctions to sell both slaves and real property to satisfy debts in most colonies. More broadly, this legal transformation likely led to greater commodification of real property, the expansion of slavery, and more capital for economic development. American landholders, however, were subjected to greater financial risk than would have been the case {{in the absence of the}} Act. The Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts was reenacted by most, but not all, state legislatures in the founding era. One legacy of the colonial era was that, through the 1840 s, most states <b>exempted</b> only minimal <b>amounts</b> of property from creditors 2 ̆ 7 claims. Tensions relating to creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies, both between the states and the federal government and between states with differing policies, had important consequences for American federalism.

40|$|The Doha Development Round {{of trade}} {{negotiations}} in the WTO aims to achieve substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. The Harbinson draft modalities were tabled in March 2003, followed by less detailed draft framework texts for modalities {{before and during}} the Cancún meeting in September 2003. The framework texts introduce new provisions not present in the Harbinson modalities or in earlier proposals, modify some provisions and eliminate others. The Harbinson modalities and the five 2003 framework texts (EC-US, del Castillo, G- 21, Derbez, and G- 21) show differences and similarities and show how certain provisions evolved over time in, e. g., the green box, the blue and revised blue box, deminimis, AMS and Total AMS commitments, and the sum of overall support. To assess the various provisions consistent assumptions are adopted for the numerical values of reductions and other parameters, which remain subject to negotiations. The resulting entitlements to provide support, after full implementation, are assessed for USA, the EU, Japan, Canada and Brazil. This shows the significance of tiered reduction commitments of Total AMS, as opposed to equal reductions for all. It also shows the significance of the size of any caps on the <b>amounts</b> <b>exempted</b> as de minimis or as blue box payments. This is particularly the case if the set of policies qualifying as exempt is made larger and perhaps more distorting by removing the production-limiting condition on blue box payments. Capping product-specific AMS amounts based on past amounts would lock in existing differences between those who provide high support to many individual products and those who provide low support to individual products. The "maximum distorting support" (MDS) is calculated for the five Members under the provisions of each of the six texts. The EC-US draft framework would allow about the same MDS as the Harbinson modalities, while the del Castillo and Derbez frameworks would result in a twenty percent reduction from Harbinson. The G- 20 framework (of September 9) would allow an MDS half as large as under Harbinson, and the G- 21 framework (September 14) would yield an MDS equal to two-thirds of Harbinson's. Overall the provisions of the draft texts are found to be dauntingly complex, with several constraints operating at the same time.
