40|$|The Automotive {{sector is}} {{undergoing}} transformation from conventional metallic materials to textiles manufactured using conventional 2 D processing techniques. It is envisaged that although still immature, composite applications into the sector will grow significantly {{over the next}} 5 to 10 years and enter more mass market vehicle applications. With the opportunity offered by 3 dimensional advanced flexible materials, the adoption process could be more attractive to Automotive and wider industrial sectors. Currently the benefits of 3 D woven preforms are being exploited in the aerospace sector by Safran ltd, with approximately 30 % weight reduction over metallic components for the leap fan blade. These reductions in weight due to superior performance are allowing {{the development of more}} efficient aerospace components and are leading the way for adoption into the automotive sector. With the need for high speed manufacturing of composite components, it is expected that weaving 3 D woven near-net-shapes could offer superior benefits to the automotive sector. Larger scale components have a particular attraction and when manufactured as a one piece woven structure (preform) will offer significant benefits {{to a wide range of}} composite applications. Manufacturing composite components is labour intensive with precise placement of multiple layers of pre-impregnated woven plies required. As the composite industries mature, further development of processes is anticipated, with high deposition rates and repeatability high on the priority list. Although many methods of processing from fibre to fabric structure exist, the ability to reduce layup times combined with rapid manufacturing using high speed looms, weaving multilayers at once is an attractive proposition and capable with conventional weaving machines. Traditionally 3 D weaving and 3 D woven structures have been classed as expensive and slow to process, severely limiting the adoption in to wider end uses and applications. This paper demonstrates how mass manufacturing capability is linked to woven 3 D structures and how output and costs in materials manufacture can be further optimised. Initial designs from CAD software were conducted and inputted into a standard weaving <b>loom</b> <b>without</b> Jacquard technology and then a 3 D one piece woven structure was obtained.

40|$|Looming signals (signals that {{indicate}} the rapid approach of objects) are behaviourally relevant for primates. We investigated whether rhesus monkeys can integrate the auditory and visual signals of a simulated looming object using the preferential-looking method. Monkeys {{were presented with}} two black discs, each on a separate LCD monitor. One disk symmetrically expanded (‘visual looming’), while the other disk symmetrically contracted (‘receding’ stimulus). An auditory signal synchronized with both visual stimuli but either increasing (‘auditory looming’) or decreasing (‘receding’) in intensity was played through a centrally-located speaker (see Ghazanfar et al. (2003) PNAS 99 : 15755 - 15757). Viewing behaviour was video-taped, digitized and looking times measured. Our preliminary results reveal that all subjects looked longer at the visual looming stimulus when presented simultaneously with an auditory looming stimulus. Conversely, {{the effect of the}} receding sound had little or no influence on their viewing behaviour. Monkeys thus appear to naturally integrate auditory-visual <b>looming</b> signals <b>without</b> any explicit training. The integration of looming, but not receding stimuli, may be because of the strong behavioural relevance of approaching objects.

40|$|Interspecies {{electron}} transfer {{is common in}} methanogenic consortia. Syntrophic partners cooperate by transferring electrons from one species to the other using H- 2, formate or other pathways, and maintaining H- 2 at low levels, so that the overall reactions are thermodynamically more favorable. Here we reviewed the mechanisms of interspecies {{electron transfer}} involved in methanogenic consortia, Le., interspecies H- 2 transfer, interspecies formate transfer, and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) via pill, and/or outer membrane cytochromes.

Interspecies electron transfer is a probable mechanism in anaerobic granules formed in upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors, though direct evidence is limited.

These mechanisms could be more energy-conserving than interspecies H- 2 or formate transfer, but the relationship between them is yet unelucidated.
