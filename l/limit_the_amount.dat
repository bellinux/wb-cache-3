5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted to <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned {{by the government}} without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening {{the power of the}} bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E

5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC to <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which {{would keep the}} other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest.

Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E

The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E
