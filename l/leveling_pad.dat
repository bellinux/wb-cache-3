50|$|Mechanically {{stabilized}} earth (MSE) {{retaining walls}} {{may be used}} for embankments.MSE walls combine a concrete <b>leveling</b> <b>pad,</b> wall facing panels, coping, soil reinforcement and select backfill.A variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used.After the <b>leveling</b> <b>pad</b> has been laid and the first row of panels has been placed and braced, the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted.The first set of reinforcements is then laid over the earth.The reinforcements, which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids, are attached to the facing panels.This process is repeated with successive layers of panels, earth and reinforcements.The panels are thus tied into the earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses.|$|E
5000|$|Pressurized {{walls are}} {{temporary}} walls built with reams of [...] " [...] (6 mm) to [...] " [...] (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm) or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies utilize LATTICE strips of wood {{to cover the}} joints of the above drywall. After the frame-out process, 1" [...] (32 mm) sheet rock screws are used to attach the drywall to the pressurized 2×4s that contact the floor, the ceiling and {{the sides of the}} property's walls. In order to prevent structural or architectural damage, only T-nuts and <b>leveling</b> screw <b>pads</b> are used on those studs. No additional fasteners or adhesives are used to add stability to the frame work.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrilling pads {{that are}} used to explore {{petroleum}} reserves in the boreal forest are often only used for a short time. We studied the vegetative regeneration potential of aspen (Populus tremuloides) through root suckers as a means to rapidly recover forest vegetation in these disturbed sites. We compared protecting the original forest floor under a layer of subsoil during the <b>leveling</b> of drilling <b>pads,</b> with the current practice of stripping off the forest floor and topsoil and placing it back on the site (Rollback) in the re-contouring of the reclamation phase. We also tested three techniques of delineating the forest floor {{so that it can be}} effectively uncovered during the reclamation phase. After re-contouring and top soil placement on the sites, we assessed the extent of surface disturbance, soil temperature, soil bulk density, and the density and height of aspen regeneration. Aspen suckers were tallest, had the highest density and had better survival when the forest floor was protected compared to the standard Rollback treatment. When protecting the forest floor, delineating the original forest floor from the subsoil cover resulted only in small differences in the aspen regeneration among delineation treatments with little impact on soil compaction and only moderate effects on soil surface disturbance. The study indicates that protection and the careful uncovering of the forest floor with or without using a delineation layer should be a preferred strategy for temporary drilling pad construction and their subsequent reclamation in aspen-dominated boreal forests...|$|R
40|$|This session covers {{quality control}} and {{assurance}} techniques {{associated with the}} construction of MSE walls. For proper performance and long-term durability, all elements of the MSE wall construction must be subject to QC/QA, including the subgrade preparation, <b>leveling</b> <b>pad,</b> fill and backfill materials and compaction, and placement of reinforcement and facing panels. Potential performance problems associated with inadequate field quality control of these elements will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} a step-stress random {{vibration}} tests are {{used to assess the}} interconnect reliability of various solder, component terminal and printed wiring board pad finishes. The durability assessment of leadless chip resistors attached with tin-lead and tin-silver-copper is examined. Component terminal finish, tin and tin-lead, in tin-lead soldered assemblies are examined. The board pad finishes used in the assemblies tested included immersion tin, immersion silver, electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold, and organic solderability preservative, while tin-lead hot air solder <b>leveling</b> <b>pad</b> finish assembled with tin-lead solder served as a baseline. Destructive failure analysis is used to assess failure locations. Although the results obtained from the test indicate that under the vibration regimen studied no significant difference was found between the durability of tin-lead and tin-silver-copper assemblies, the lead-free components did outperform the tin-lead assemblies. Pad finish is found to have a greater influence on tin-lead as compared to tin-silver-copper soldered assemblies. Immersion silver and electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold showed the best durability results...|$|E
