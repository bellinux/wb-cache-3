50|$|A valve job is best {{done with}} {{grinding}} stones and either electric or pneumatic tools. <b>Lapping</b> <b>compound</b> and a lapping tool may be used, {{and is more}} economical for home auto repair, however lapping will only provide limited results {{and will not be}} effective on a valve or seat with anything more than very light wear or damage.|$|E
5000|$|Early filing or rasping (the {{distinction}} is emic, not etic) has prehistoric roots and grew naturally {{out of the}} blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as hand axes) and abrading using natural abrasives, such as well-suited types of stone (for example, sandstone). Relatedly, lapping is also quite ancient, with wood and beach sand offering a natural pair of lap and <b>lapping</b> <b>compound.</b> The Disston authors state, [...] "To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,—also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water." ...|$|E
30|$|The most certain {{method was}} used to detect the samples of aseptic milk (Yili) and lamb-steeped liquor (Haoyue) [26]. A series of {{different}} concentrations of 16 M were artificially inoculated into the pasteurized milk and lamb-steeped liquor (the lamb liquid <b>lapping</b> <b>compound</b> soaked by saline for 24  h) and then detected the 16 M with this method as described above.|$|E
500|$|For {{the third}} year in a row, Pirelli opted to bring its two hardest dry weather {{compounds}} for this event, the orange-banded hard compound as the [...] "prime" [...] selection, while the white-banded medium tyre used as the [...] "option" [...] selection. The two wet-weather tyres, the green-banded intermediate and blue-banded full wet tyres, were also available to use as they are at all events. Pirelli cited {{the nature of the}} track and the high lateral energy loads experienced in the corners, in particular 130R – typically taken at full throttle and top speed in dry weather racing – as reasons for the hardest tyres being used. The suppliers expected a performance difference of 0.6–0.8 seconds per <b>lap</b> between the <b>compounds.</b>|$|R
25|$|Massa kept {{within a}} {{reasonable}} {{gap between the two}} Mercedes cars and established a 2.4 second advantage over Ricciardo. Williams elected to make a pit stop for Bottas {{at the end of the}} 30th <b>lap</b> for medium <b>compound</b> tyres and Ricciardo responded by demonstrating quick pace to go seven-tenths of a second faster than Bottas in the final sector. Ricciardo made his pit stop on the following lap and emerged in front of Bottas. He began matching Massa's pace before the latter made his stop on lap 32 which proved problematic: his mechanics were delayed for one second when they were installing one of Massa's front tyres, allowing Ricciardo into third position. Hamilton entered the pit lane from the lead on the 33rd for his second (and final) stop and rejoined behind teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg was informed by his team to increase his pace and led the field on the 34th lap before making his pit stop, handing the place back to Hamilton. Grosjean was passed by Vettel for tenth position on lap 37 and drew close to Magnussen shortly after. He overtook Magnussen around the outside three laps later but was unable to slow sufficiently and the latter reclaimed the position.|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the study of the {{structural}} phase transitions in intermetallic <b>compounds</b> <b>LaPd</b> 2 (Al,Ga) 2 by low-temperature x-ray powder diffraction and macroscopic measurements on single crystals. The results obtained from powder diffraction at room temperature confirm that the compounds crystallize in tetragonal CaBe 2 Ge 2 structure type (space group P 4 /nmm). At low temperature all the compounds undergo the same structural phase transition by lowering the symmetry to the orthorhombic space group Cmma. Although the structural transformation is of first order, the transition is not-manifested in step-like change of the phase at a certain temperature, but occurs in a broader temperature interval. In this interval the different phases coexist and transform gradually from high- to low- temperature phase. After application of hydrostatic pressure the structural transition is shifted to higher temperatures. Despite that the low temperature structures are of the same type, {{there is a difference between}} compounds containing Ga and Al in the discontinuity of the lattice parameters resulting in a distinct anomaly in electrical resistivity. In pressures > 0. 6 GPa this characteristic anomaly on single crystalline CePd 2 Al 2 is changed, indicating a pressure- induced change of the low-temperature [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Create {{hardware}} and software solutions allowing the smartphone {{to be used to}} visualise the retina. Methods: The target device under investigation is the Samsung Galaxy S 3 (Samsung Group). Accompanying software was designed for the android platform to automate such features as optic cup:disc ratio calculation, with a view to aiding diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. An adaptor clip was designed with Rhinoceros 3 D (McNeel and Associates), and manufactured in PolyLactic Acid (PLA) by Fused Filament Fabrication using an Up! Plus 3 D printer (PP 3 DP, China). The optics blanks were cut on a CTR E 5 (CTR Lasers, UK) laser cutter and polished by hand using diamond <b>lapping</b> <b>compound,</b> to create a miniature prismatic solution re-routing light from the native flash to become coincident with the optical path. Results: Peek provides high-resolution images of the retina sufficient for clinical examination, with a greater field than conventional direct ophthalmoscopy. Images obtained with Peek, along with comparative images using conventional disc photography are demonstrated in Figure 1. The relative differences in field between Peek and other ophthalmoscopic modalities are demonstrated in Figure 2. Conclusions: Peek is a low-cost alternative to the direct ophthalmoscope, comprising a smartphone adaptor that circumvents many of the technically challenging aspects of fundoscopy. The technology takes advantage of the intrinsic auto-focussing features within the smartphone to provide a high-resolution view of the retina through an undilated pupil. The adaptor couples the native mobile LED flash to optical path of the camera, allowing clinicians access to a previously unobtainable view of the retina using a smartphone. The connectivity of smartphone devices adds capacity to transmit retinal findings to secondary care for more effective triage in cases of diagnostic doubt. This low-cost technology has been designed with a view to improving access to ophthalmic diagnostics in resource-poor settings. Trials are underway {{to assess the impact of}} the technology in the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in a related cluster randomised controlled trial based in Kenya...|$|E
25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a five-place grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but slid in turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top ten until a tear-off visor wrapped itself around one of his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an engine component. His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one <b>lap</b> on soft <b>compound</b> tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|R
40|$|An {{isothermal}} {{section of}} the phase diagram for the system La [...] -Pd [...] -O at 1200 K has been established by equilibration of samples representing seventeen different compositions, and phase identification after quenching by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX). The binary oxide PdO was not stable at 1200 K. Two ternary oxides La_ 4 PdO_ 7 and La_ 2 Pd_ 2 O_ 5 were identified. Liquid alloys and the intermetallic <b>compounds</b> <b>LaPd,</b> La_ 3 Pd_ 4 and LaPd_ 3, {{were found to be}} in equilibrium with La_ 2 O_ 3. Based on the phase relations, two solid-state cells were designed to measure the Gibbs energies of formation of the two ternary oxides. An advanced version of the solid-state cell incorporating a buffer electrode was used for high temperature thermodynamic measurements. The function of the buffer electrode, placed between reference and working electrodes, was to absorb the electrochemical flux of the mobile species through the solid electrolyte caused by trace electronic conductivity. The buffer electrode prevented polarization of the measuring electrode and ensured accurate data. Yttria-stabilized zirconia was used as the solid electrolyte and pure oxygen gas at a pressure of 0. 1 MPa as the reference electrode. Electromotive force (emf) measurements, conducted in the temperature range from 925 to 1400 K, indicated the presence of a third ternary oxide La_ 2 PdO_ 4, stable below 1171 (± 5) K. Additional solid state cells were designed to study this compound. The standard Gibbs energy of formation of the interoxide compounds from their component binary oxides La 2 O 3 and PdO can be represented by the following equations: La_ 4 PdO_ 7 : _f(ox) G ^ 0 [J mol ^- 1] = - 46 550 + 0. 56 T (± 220), La_ 2 PdO_ 4 : _f(ox) G ^ 0 [J mol ^- 1] = - 42 000 + 2. 19 T (± 160), La_ 4 Pd_ 2 O_ 5 : _f(ox) G ^ 0 [J mol ^- 1] = - 73 990 + 1. 33 T (± 310), Based on the thermodynamic information, chemical potential diagrams for the system La [...] -Pd [...] -O were developed...|$|R
