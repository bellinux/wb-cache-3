Many city budgets constrain the flexibility of municipal government officials to invest in GHG reduction projects, viewing the issue as a <b>luxury</b> <b>expenditure.</b> It is not un-common in response however for CCP municipal governments to convince officials to invest in some GHG reduction technologies, with the argument money saved through mitigation strategies {{can be used for}} re-investment in further mitigation strategies.|$|E
40|$|Social {{media has}} {{recently}} {{become an integral}} part of daily lives among individuals around the world. With this digital innovation, people have changed the way they consume products, express their identities, and communicate with each other. This study investigates how consumers construct identity through luxury consumption in an online context; particularly, Facebook. Most extant research papers explore the identity construction through anonymous context such as virtual game world; in contrast, Facebook is considered as a non-anonymous context because people are established by their real names and pictures. The author explores how participants manage their online presentation of self and investigates the goal or values that customers seek from presenting the use of luxury product online in Thailand, which is regarded to have a top number of Facebook users and also one of the highest levels of <b>luxury</b> <b>expenditure</b> in Asia. The qualitative research was conducted on a convenience sample of ten Thai participants whose age ranged from 20 - 25 years who are users of Facebook and have prior luxury consumption. The result indicates that people are more susceptible to interpersonal influences. The majority of people on Facebook use the display of luxury to signal status and power as well as to seek friendship and compliance. They tend to strategically manage their profiles through the highly visible luxury consumption. Wealth signals are seen as appropriate in Thai context because they provide many social benefits such as enhancing one's appearance and social recognition. People feel self-enhanced through seeking affirmations and likes from friends and they account on the number of likes and comments. With the lack of richness of interaction in the online context, people tend to hide certain aspects of self and instead construct a desired aspect of self. However, due to the honest characteristic of Facebook, they tend to present a favourable self within the bounds of reality...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reappraise Montesquieu’s thinkings in economy. To Joseph Schumpeter his {{economic}} is insignificant - without originality force, or scholarship. According to John-Maynard Keynes, Montesquieu was the real French equivalent of Adam Smith, the greatest of French economists, head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration, clear-headedness and good sense. This controversy invites us to undertake an investigation of Montesquieu’s views in economy. This article explores thoughtfully his works and proposes an application of heuristic reading systematic and very progressive too. About all of the subjects (interest rate, money, <b>luxury</b> <b>expenditures,</b> state’s position in society, taxation, public debt, international trade) we try to place Montesquieu in the opposition between interventionism and laisser-faire. Through this analysis J-B. Say, J-M Keynes, J. Schumpeter opinions on Montesquieu become clear especially on interest rate issue. Finally, we conclude that Montesquieu is one of the few French economists to propose a monetary analysis of the interest rate, but his liberal doctrinal leads him to reject all the form of interventionism particularly in the monetary sphere. Definitely, Montesquieu’s just one link of the liberal chain in Europe. Interest rate, liberalism, international trade...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The global {{financial}} crisis {{has proved to}} have {{had a significant impact on}} countries worldwide and South Africa was not spared of this global phenomenon. The ecological systems theory, family systems theory and gestalt field theory accentuate the impact a change within the environment can have on interconnected systems and it is therefore argued that the global unstable economy can have a significant impact on families and children. Literature indicates a vast amount of confirmation on the impact of the financial crisis on already poverty stricken areas. On the contrary, less focus is offered on the impact of the financial crisis on families within middle to upper class communities. Preliminary research confirms that although the basic needs of these families (such as food and shelter) have not been affected, significant change with regards to <b>luxuries</b> and <b>expenditure</b> patterns is present. Due to the fact that parents within families are also faced with financial difficulties, these changes are not facilitated and discussed with children and adolescents, causing unresolved emotions and uncertainties. This research was therefore aimed at the development of web based assistance for parents. In addition to the set aim of this research, the study arrived at findings that indicate and emphasise the important contribution of this study. Intervention research as research method was used in the conducting of the study. The developed web based assistance proved to serve as a functional tool for parents in addressing financial issues with their children and adolescents. It also raised parents’ awareness of the impact that a change in finances in the family can have which empowered the parents as well. It was also significantly noted that the website can be utilised within an educational setting which enhances the applicability of this study. The developed assistance contributes to society as it serves as a cost effective, accessible means of providing parents with practical guidelines and activities to help their children and adolescents deal with the effects of economic instability within the family.

Yet {{there are other people}} than the needy whose souls are entrusted to the clergy here, and in order to fulfil that trust they must mix on some degree of equality with the gentry, and with the middle classes who are well-to-do. Then again, consider both as to clergy and laity here. If they were all to lower themselves a peg or two, and give up many not only luxuries, but comforts, numbers of tradesmen, and others working under them, aye, even merchants, manufacturers, and commercial men of all sorts, would be to some extent thrown out of employ. The artificial and even luxurious state of society here does really prevent many persons from falling into the class of the needy. All this should be regulated in its due proportion. Every man ought so to limit his expenses as to have a good margin for charitable purposes of all sorts, but I cannot think that he is doing good by living himself like a pauper in order to assist paupers. If all men did so, labour of all kinds would be overstocked with hands, and more paupers created. True it is, that we all are too apt as means increase, some to set our hearts upon them, which is wickedness; some to indulge in over much luxury, which is wicked also; there should be moderation in all things. I believe that more money is given in private charities of various kinds in helping those who are struggling with small means, and yet not apparently in the class of the needy, than the world is aware of; and those who do the most are precisely those who are never heard of. But do not mistake me. I am no advocate for <b>luxury</b> and idle <b>expenditure.</b> Yet I think you carry your argument a little farther than is just. The impositions that are practised, or attempted to be practised, upon charitable people are beyond all conception.' The following is the answer:-- ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} goal is estimating Saudi Arabia imports demand {{during the}} period 1994 - 2000 {{on the basis of}} quarterly data for all imports by broad economic category which contain seven groups, food and beverages, materials and supplies, fuels and lubricants, machinery and capital equipment, transportation equipment and accessories, consumer goods not elsewhere specified and goods not elsewhere specified. Rotterdam demand differential approach has been estimated using iterative seemingly unrelated regression technique to estimate the model parameters. Estimated coefficients were used to calculate the compensated and uncompensated price elasticities and expenditure elasticity. The study achieves some results as follows: 1. 	The price variable has significant effect on demanding all groups whit negative sign which consist with economic theory. 2. 	The expenditure variable has significant effect on demanding all groups' whit positive sign which consist with economic theory. 3. 	the demand of food and beverages is effected by changes in the own price and the prices of materials and supplies, machinery and capital equipment, and goods not elsewhere specifies, while the demand of materials and supplies sensitive for all groups prices except goods not specified. On other hand, demand for fuels and lubricants affected by the price of consumer goods not specified whereas demand of machinery and capital equipments is effected by the prices of food and beverages and materials and supplies. Further, demand for transportation equipment and accessories sensitive to change in materials and supplies prices where the demand for goods not specified is sensitive for changes in materials and supplies prices and fuels and lubricants prices. 4. 	The expenditure elasticities of all groups included in the study are positive and significant. Expenditure elasticities for fuels and lubricants, transportation equipment and accessories, goods not specified are grater than one meaning they are <b>luxury</b> goods. Also, <b>expenditure</b> elasticities for food and beverages, materials and supplies, machinery and capital equipment and good not specified are less than one meaning they are necessity goods. 5. 	The uncompensated own price elasticities have negative sign for all groups included in this study and significant. The absolute values of elasticities are range between zero and one for all groups except machinery and equipment which means inelastic demand for these groups. For machinery and equipment groups the elasticity absolute value is grater than one which means an elastic demand for this group. 6. 	 the demand for goods and beverages group, fuels and lubricants groups, machinery and equipment group, transportation equipment group and goods not specified group are more sensitive for change in expenditure than change in prices while demand for materials and supplies group and consumer goods not specified are more sensitive for changes in prices than changes in expenditur...|$|R
