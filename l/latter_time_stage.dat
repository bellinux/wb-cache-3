40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of six cultivars named Cubano, Niger, Cubano 2032, 9277, 7551 and, 7566, of kenaf and three {{harvesting}} <b>time</b> <b>stages</b> on pulp and handsheet paper properties of kenaf, which were accomplished in north of Iran. Six cultivars of an Iranian kenaf (Hibiscus Cannabinus L.), were planted on 19 May 2007, and harvested at 85, 105, and 135 days after planting. It was understood that {{with the increase of}} plant age, the fiber yield increased. Maximum yield at each of three harvesting <b>time</b> <b>stages</b> was related to Niger. Consequently, if a high fiber yield is sought, Niger can be recommended. But if a paper with high strength properties is to be requested, Cubano 2032 is strongly associated with significant burst, tear, breaking length, and fold endurance even though its yield shows a bit lesser than Niger at short harvesting times. Moreover, at second harvesting <b>time</b> <b>stage,</b> maximum strength properties of handsheets such as burst, tear, breaking length, and fold endurance were related to Cubano, though the fiber yield of this cultivar was a bit lesser than Niger, but it was still more than Cubano 2032. In comparison between harvesting <b>time</b> <b>stages,</b> it is clearly understood from the composition of harvesting <b>time</b> of third <b>stage</b> to first and second stage, a minor positive effect on the handsheets properties with increasing harvesting times has appeared...|$|R
