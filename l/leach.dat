He was the second child of Elias James <b>Leach</b> (1873–1935) and Elsie Maria <b>Leach</b> (née Kingdon; 1877–1973). Elias worked as a tailor's presser at a clothes factory while Elsie worked as a seamstress. Grant's elder brother, John William Elias <b>Leach</b> (1899–1900), died of tuberculous meningitis. Grant considered himself to have been partly Jewish. He had an unhappy upbringing; his father was an alcoholic, and his mother suffered from clinical depression.|$|E

40|$|Upon rewetting, lichens lose polyols through <b>leaching.</b> We {{quantified}} <b>leaching</b> {{losses for}} 21 species under simulated rainfall. Polyol concentrations in these lichens range from 1. 0 to 8. 8 %, {{with a mean}} of 2. 8 %. <b>Leaching</b> losses range up to about 7. 5 mg (polyol) /g (lichen dry weight) in a typical rain event. The rate of polyol <b>leaching</b> declines exponentially, becoming negligible within 1 hour of continuous rain. The response of polyol <b>leaching</b> rate to rainfall intensity and amount varies between species—six species showed no response, one had increased <b>leaching</b> with increased rainfall intensity, four had increased <b>leaching</b> with increased amount of rainfall, and one had decreased <b>leaching</b> with increased total amount of rainfall.

40|$|Salt {{affected}} soils may be reclaimed by <b>leaching,</b> but continuously {{pending the}} soil surface and allowing infiltration requires large quantities of water. During such <b>leaching</b> bypass flow occurs, consequently solute within the aggregates is transported much slower decreasing the overall <b>leaching</b> efficiency. The alternate is intermittent <b>leaching</b> which provides time for diffusion of solute from aggregates. Flux density and aggregate size have great effect on the <b>leaching</b> efficiency. Thus <b>leaching</b> of columns of spherical aggregates of three different sizes {{was carried out in}} the laboratory with continuous and intermittent <b>leaching</b> to explore the effect of aggregate size and the water flux density on the <b>leaching</b> efficiency. In continuous <b>leaching</b> the inflow of fresh water into column was set equal to outflow of leachate so that the aggregates were bathing in fresh water all the time. In case of intermittent <b>leaching</b> the inflow and out flow of water were regularly interrupted after certain time so as to provide time for salts in aggregates to diffuse out in the macro pores around the aggregates. Experimental results showed that <b>leaching</b> efficiency with intermittent <b>leaching</b> increased with increasing water flux density and aggregate diameter. Depending on the size of aggregate and water flux density water savings up to 65 % were obtained under laboratory conditions by using intermittent <b>leaching</b> compared to that of continuous <b>leaching...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>leaching</b> process {{when water}} attacks concrete, {{and the effect}} of <b>leaching</b> on the {{strength}} and durability of a concrete structure, is analysed theoretically. Technique for prediction of the future <b>leaching</b> and structural stability is outlined. The analysis is to a certain extent supported by data from literature. The <b>leaching</b> process is divided in five different types: 1 : Pure surface <b>leaching</b> 2 : Surface <b>leaching</b> involving erosion 3 : Homogeneous <b>leaching</b> over the entire structure 4 : Semi-homogeneous <b>leaching</b> over the entire structure 5 : <b>Leaching</b> in defects within the structure For each type, the physical <b>leaching</b> process is outlined. Consideration is taken to the increase in permeability caused by <b>leaching</b> making it theoretically possible to predict the future <b>leaching</b> from an analysis of the water flow and degree of <b>leaching</b> at the time of inspection of the structure. The effect of <b>leaching</b> on strength and E-modulus of the concrete is analysed showing that the effect can be substantial. A short discussion is made on the effect of <b>leaching</b> on the structural stability and on the changes in structural stability in the future. Important mechanical factors discussed are changes in compressive strength, tensile strength and bond strength between reinforcement and concrete. The increased risk of reinforcement corrosion and frost damage in <b>leached</b> concrete is discussed and found to be big. The effect of changes in the internal uplift pressure in dams due to changed flow paths inside the dam {{and the effect of}} these changes on the dam stability are mentioned. Finally, in an APPENDIX, a simple method is outlined for how to assess the concrete strength from information of the physical composition of the cement paste.

5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} <b>leach.</b> This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a <b>leach</b> tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
30|$|Figures  9 and 10 {{show that}} the <b>leaching</b> of Ca 2 + ion from Ledo coal is maximum at high {{temperature}} 65  °C which {{is an indication of}} maximum <b>leaching</b> of Ca 2 + ion in monsoon season. The low concentration of Na+, Mg 2 +, NH 4 + and Li+ ions in the leachates of coal and overburden at high temperature indicates minimum <b>leaching</b> of these ions in monsoon season. Table S 5 shows the decrease in <b>leaching</b> of Li+ ion with <b>leaching</b> duration. Since lithium is generally associated in coal and overburden as lithium silicate and the decrease in concentration of Li+ ion in leachates with <b>leaching</b> time is attributed to the production of orthosilicic acid (Li et al. 2017). Figures  11, 12, 13 and 14 show an increase in F−, Cl− and SO 42 − ion concentrations in aqueous leachates of Ledo coal and OB with <b>leaching</b> time which {{is due to the fact}} that <b>leaching</b> time is an important factor which determine the amount of elements <b>leached</b> from the raw coal (Moyo et al. 2011).
