There are many ICT initiatives in Sri Lankan education system over the past decade. This {{is the best time to}} evaluate those efforts for their effectiveness. Objectives of this research is to assess the <b>impact</b> of ICT <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> and teaching in secondary schools in Sri Lanka, to assess the current ICT usage in schools, to identify the drivers and barriers for achieving a greater <b>impact</b> of ICT <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> and teaching and to derive a set of recommendations, that would help future policy making. The chosen methodology is to ask questions from the key stakeholders of the school about how they perceive the <b>impact</b> of ICT <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> and teaching. Data collection in the study is based on three questionnaires. Respondents are the head of the school, teachers and students in grade 10 to 12 classes. The study covered 80 schools among the Secondary Education Modernization Project funded schools. The research study found that there is no direct relationship between the computer usage of students and their perceived <b>impact</b> of ICT <b>on</b> <b>learning.</b> Both students and teachers attitude toward use of ICT for learning and teaching purposes are statistically significant and positively related to their perceived <b>impact</b> of ICT <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> and teaching.

40|$|Learning {{management}} systems (LMSs) are very {{widely used in}} higher education. However, {{much of the research}} on LMSs has had a technology focus or has been limited to studies of adoption. In order {{to take advantage of the}} potential associated with LMSs, research that addresses the role of LMSs in learning success is needed. Task-technology fit is one factor that has been shown to influence both the use of information systems and their performance impacts. The study described in this paper used the technology-to-performance chain as a framework to address the question of how task-technology fit influences the performance impacts of LMSs. The results provide strong support for the importance of task-technology fit, which influenced perceived <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> both directly and indirectly via level of utilization. Whilst task-technology fit had a strong influence <b>on</b> perceived <b>impact</b> of the LMS <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> it only had a weak <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> outcomes in terms of student grades.

This research aimed to discover {{the positive or negative}} influences (called critical incidents) that differentially affect the academic adjustment and success of first year dental students with Australian and non-Australian background cultures. A cross-sectional survey utilizing a self-completed questionnaire was undertaken of all first year Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and Bachelor of Oral Health (BOH) students who attended a Behavioural Science lecture in August 2007. The “critical incidents” which <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> the <b>learning</b> of students of Australian and non-Australian self-defined cultural backgrounds were compared. Of the 26 “critical incident” questions that <b>impacted</b> <b>on</b> the student’s academic adjustment during the year, the vast majority (23) were similar between students of Australian compared to those of non-Australian cultural backgrounds. Being confident with library skills had a greater positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> for students with a non-Australian background than it did for Australian students. Lecturers and lectures {{were more likely to have}} a negative influence and less likely to have a positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>learning</b> of non- Australian students.

Thus, students from Australian and non-Australian background cultures, whether they be international or local students, identified similar learning issues and problems.
