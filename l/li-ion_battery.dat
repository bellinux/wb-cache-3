An accurate estimation of available capacity for <b>Li-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> has an important utility significance to optimize its performance in the applications of EVs. The Peukert equation is applied to estimate the available capacity of batteries. However, {{the fact that the}} available capacity of <b>Li-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> is dependent on battery temperatures can result in errors while using the Peukert equation. To address this problem, this paper proposes an extended Peukert equation to include temperature effect. This method considers battery temperature as an input variable into the Peukert equation. Experiments based on <b>Li-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> are carried out under various current and temperatures. The comparison of the estimated and the actual available capacity indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide a reliable and accurate estimation of the available capacity for <b>Li-ion</b> <b>batteries...</b>|$|R

The only alternative to <b>Li-ion</b> <b>batteries</b> with comparable power, the Zebra cell (Table 2), is based on molten salt and, thus, only useful for continuous every day use.

However, the price for a complete Li-ion cell set offering 14 kWh capacity, allowing a 100 -km electrical range of a small-size car (like a Smart, see below), is still in the order of 5, 000 Euro including taxes.
