500|$|Sluggish in nature, the {{bramble shark}} feeds on smaller sharks (including the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias), bony fishes (including ling, catfishes, and <b>lizardfishes),</b> and crabs. The large {{size of its}} pharynx, {{relative}} to its mouth, suggests that it may capture prey by suction. This species is aplacental viviparous; females have two functional ovaries and two uteruses. Recorded litter sizes have ranged from 15 to 52, and newly born pups have been estimated to measure [...] long. The dermal denticles in near-term embryos are underdeveloped, appearing as minute spines located within open pits in the skin. The size at sexual maturity is uncertain; the smallest known mature males and females are [...] and [...] long respectively.|$|E

500|$|The bignose shark feeds {{mainly on}} bottom-dwelling bony fishes (including <b>lizardfishes,</b> croakers, flatfishes, and batfishes), {{cartilaginous}} fishes (including Squalus dogfishes, Holohalaelurus catsharks, Dasyatis stingrays, and chimaeras), and cephalopods. In turn, juveniles may potentially {{fall prey to}} larger sharks. Like other requiem sharks, this species is viviparous: when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups, with seven being typical, following a gestation period of approximately 10 months. A single litter may be sired by two or more males. Birthing {{has been reported to}} occur in August and September in the Mediterranean, and in September and October off Madagascar. The newborns measure [...] long. Males and females mature sexually at around [...] long, respectively. The average age of reproductively active individuals is 21 years.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lizardfishes</b> (or typical <b>lizardfishes</b> to {{distinguish}} {{them from the}} Bathysauridae and Pseudotrichonotidae) are a family, the Synodontidae, of aulopiform fish. They are found in tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world.Lizardfishes are generally small fish, although the largest species are about 60 cm (24 in) long. They have slender, somewhat cylindrical bodies, and heads that resemble those of lizards. The dorsal fin {{is located in the}} middle of the back, and accompanied by a small adipose fin placed closer to the tail. They have mouths full of sharp teeth, even on the tongue.They are bottom-dwelling fish, living in shallow coastal waters; even the deepest dwelling lizardfish lives in waters no more than 400 m (1,300 ft). Some species in the subfamily Harpadontinae even live in brackish estuaries. They prefer sandy environments, and typically have body colours that help to camouflage them in such environments.The larvae of <b>lizardfishes</b> are free-swimming.
