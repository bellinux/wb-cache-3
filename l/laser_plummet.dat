50|$|Some modern total {{stations}} have a <b>laser</b> <b>plummet</b> {{which allows the}} instrument to be levelled and positioned vertically over a survey monument or ground control point. Other tribrachs have an optical plummet with either a bullseye or cross hair sight for positioning the instrument. The oldest tribrachs required a plumb line {{to allow them to}} be positioned vertically over a point and were slower to set up.|$|E
50|$|A {{theodolite}} {{is mounted}} on its tripod head {{by means of a}} forced centering plate or tribrach containing four thumbscrews, or in modern theodolites, three for rapid leveling. Before use, a theodolite must be precisely placed vertically above the point to be measured using a plumb bob, optical plummet or <b>laser</b> <b>plummet.</b> The instrument is then set level using leveling footscrews and circular and more precise tubular spirit bubbles.|$|E
