5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow <b>Lusophone</b> country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two <b>Lusophone</b> countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E

He started strong for the Castile and León side, scoring 6 times in his first 12 games, but only found the net once in the following five-and-a-half months as the campaign eventually ended in relegation from La Liga. He was sent off in a goalless draw against Espanyol on 24 March 2010 for a stamp on Dídac Vilà in the first half.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{relations}} between Portuguese-speakers living in London. It takes {{the experience of}} <b>Lusophones</b> {{as a case study}} in illuminating how intragroup diversity is negotiated and transnational, multi-ethnic identities constructed and performed in everyday life. Through critical ethnography and interviewing, I provide an account of the varied experience of ‘belonging’ in Europe, for citizens and migrants who connect through similar language and cultural affinities and a shared, albeit contentious, history. By exploring daily rituals in workplaces, bars, cafes, and shops owned, operated, and patronized by <b>Lusophones,</b> I unpack postcolonial reconfigurations of citizens and migrants in their everyday experience of ‘open’ Europe and provide insight into the discursive processes of emergent and complex diasporic identities. The study found that while Portuguese and Brazilian individuals connect in daily ritual, often to consume similar goods and/or work together in similar roles, language ideology plays a central role in mediating interaction and relations remain superficial and often contentious. For Portuguese, narratives of their own ‘rightness’ – when it comes to stories of migration, doing business, and conducting everyday life – along with the privilege of European citizenship, are tropes employed to distinguish themselves from other <b>Lusophones,</b> especially Brazilians, with whom they are often compared to by other groups. Luso Africans share less connection in every day life with both Portuguese and Brazilians despite living in close proximity, and express more affinity with migrants from other African points of origin than fellow <b>Lusophones.</b> The study suggests that for Portuguese and Brazilians especially, language, identity politics and the citizen-migrant distinction {{play a central role in}} mitigating meaningful interaction around shared concern and social issues impacting both groups as ‘non-native’ to the UK. Furthermore, important questions of race – which since colonial times have been at the very core of determining social privilege - are sidestepped by the drawing of moral boundaries of ‘right versus wrong’ and the ‘European vs. non-European’...|$|R

25|$|This {{means that}} the {{population}} living in the <b>Lusophone</b> official area is around 280,000,000 inhabitants. This number {{does not include the}} <b>Lusophone</b> diaspora, estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of <b>Lusophone</b> territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. It is also important to note that {{a large part of the}} diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.|$|E

25|$|In <b>Lusophone</b> {{countries}} such as Portugal, Cape Verde and especially Brazil, football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. Pelé, Nani, Ronaldo, Eusébio, Marta). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include nicknames (Michel, Arteaga, Arzu), derivations of the player's surname (Coro, Guti), derivations of the player's first name (Juanfran, Kiko), diminutives (Juanito, Mista), or the player's first name (Xavi, Sergi, Raúl). Because {{there are a few}} very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the Venezuelan Miku, the Ivorian Gervinho and the Serbian-born American Preki. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players Hortência and Nenê.|$|E
25|$|Through {{successive}} enlargements, the Union {{has grown}} from the seven founding states—Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe—to the current nine, with the self-determination of Timor-Leste in 2002 and the accession of Equatorial Guinea in 2014 at the 10th summit in Dili, Timor-Leste with the issuance of the Dili Declaration. The community is growing from a cultural background to a geopolitical and economical community, as the CPLP is the fourth largest producer {{of oil in the}} world and the growing number of larger nations attempting to enter the organization, such as Turkey and Indonesia. In 2016, CPLP revised its cooperation protocol in defense, affirming the organization in the promotion of peace and security. In 2017, in Brasilia, the nine member states agreed to enlarge cooperation in matters of the seas, tourism, economy and a more ambitious defense and cooperation mechanisms. More rights to the observer states was also approved, which Argentina planned to join. Easing citizens cross-border movement between the member states was also proposed. This propose by Portugal and Cape Verde towards Brazil was thought by some to collide with Europe's Schengen area. However, this free movement is based in a different model: as residence permits, associated with the recognition of academic degrees and professional qualification, maintenance of social rights including pension systems. It would henceforth establish the <b>Lusophone</b> citizenship, the cidadania lusófona.|$|E

2500|$|The {{culture of}} the Goan Catholics {{is a blend of}} Indian-Hindu and Portuguese-Christian cultures, with the latter having a more {{dominant}} role due to Goa being a part of Portugal for over 450 years.

However, contemporary Goan-Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicized Indo-Latin culture and is widely seen as distinct, both in India {{and the rest of the}} world. The Goan Catholic diaspora is concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, the <b>Lusophone</b> world, especially Portugal, and the Anglophone world, especially United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the United States.
