The remainder is worked in <b>linen</b> <b>floss</b> using a split stitch that flows independently from the mesh of the canvas. In {{the opinion of}} Cyril Davenport, the embroidery on this book is very high quality: [...] "I know of no other instance for which appropriateness of workmanship, or charm of design, can compare with this, the earliest of all." [...] Davenport praises both the technical quality of the stitching and the overall rendering of the figures and drapery. See illustration for the front cover.|$|E
