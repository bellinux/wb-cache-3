500|$|A bright blues [...] "stomper" [...] about lovers parting, [...] "Most <b>Likely</b> <b>You</b> Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine" [...] {{is one of}} {{the more}} literal songs Dylan {{recorded}} in his 1965–66 period. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is going to let her [...] "pass". As in [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] and [...] "Absolutely Sweet Marie", he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line, which in this case comes from the title. [...] "Most <b>Likely</b> <b>You</b> Go Your Way" [...] was issued as a single a year later, in March 1967, on the B-side of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat".|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records {{released}} the triple CD retrospective album Dylan, anthologising {{his entire career}} under the Dylan 07 logo. As part of this campaign, Mark Ronson produced a re-mix of Dylan's 1966 tune [...] "Most <b>Likely</b> <b>You</b> Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine", which was released as a maxi-single. This {{was the first time}} Dylan had sanctioned a re-mix of one of his classic recordings.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "insecurity and {{the release}} that comes in admitting it". Jim Farber from New York Daily News opined that Madonna [...] "ponders either running from, or accepting the end of, her career", whereas Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Madonna [...] "confront confusion, fear and change". Regarding the lyrics [...] "I walk this razor's edge / Will I stand or will I fall?", Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound expressed that: [...] "When the world that you made goes onto change without you, keeping up becomes a bigger and bigger risk. If you're Madonna, you take that risk no matter how <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> are to come {{out the other side}} without stumbling." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nashville {{sessions}} comprise: twenty takes of [...] "Fourth Time Around", four takes of [...] "Visions of Johanna", fourteen takes of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", four takes of [...] "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands", fifteen takes of [...] "Stuck Inside of Mobile {{with the}} Memphis Blues Again", three takes of [...] "Absolutely Sweet Marie", eighteen takes of [...] "Just Like a Woman", three takes of [...] "Pledging My Time", six takes of [...] "Most <b>Likely</b> <b>You</b> Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)", four takes of [...] "Temporary Like Achilles", four takes of [...] "Obviously Five Believers", five takes of [...] "I Want You", and one take of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35". The 18 CDs also contain brief recordings of guitar and keyboard inserts.|$|E
500|$|According to Wilentz {{the final}} {{recording}} session, on March 9–10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number {{to be recorded}} to Dylan's satisfaction was [...] "Most <b>Likely</b> <b>You</b> Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing {{the sound of the}} song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded [...] "Temporary Like Achilles". The session atmosphere began to [...] "get giddy" [...] around midnight when Dylan roughed out [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; [...] "That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band". Dylan replied; [...] "Can you get one?" [...] Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.|$|E
2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, the more <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would {{have a much better}} shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E
