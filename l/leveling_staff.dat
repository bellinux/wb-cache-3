5000|$|The {{spirit level}} is {{on a tripod}} with sight lines to the two points whose height {{difference}} is to be determined. A graduated <b>leveling</b> <b>staff</b> or rod is held vertical on each point; the rod may be graduated in centimetres and fractions or tenths and hundredths of a foot. The observer focuses in turn on each rod and reads the value. Subtracting the [...] "back" [...] and [...] "forward" [...] value provides the height difference. If the instrument is placed equidistant from the two points to be measured, any small errors in its adjustment {{and the effects of}} earth curvature and refraction will tend to cancel out.|$|E

30|$|We mapped surface {{ruptures}} {{associated with}} the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence and measured their displacement using measuring tapes, <b>leveling</b> <b>staffs,</b> and handheld laser rangefinders. Here, we report slip measurements in terms of strike-slip and vertical components, {{because most of the}} surface ruptures had predominantly dextral strike-slip or vertical offsets with little extension. Only surface ruptures along the northeastern part of the Futagawa segment had a significant extensional component. Near the Takaki area on the Takano-Shirahata segment, we measured displacements twice (April 16 and 28) after the mainshock to assess possible afterslip.|$|R

The careful adjustment of leveling instruments and a well-designed survey scheme {{have resulted in the}} considerable improvement of measurement accuracy to the level of 0. 5 mm/km, which is less than the quarter of the first order leveling surveys. On the soft ground and asphalt roads, a sufficient number of supplemental benchmarks installed on stable base are very effective in the accidental subsidence of <b>leveling</b> <b>staffs.</b> ＜論説...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{make up the}} {{shortage}} of the existing calibration equipments of the wave measurement instruments, the WTTVS is designed, and {{the design of the}} wave height standard device as a subsystem of the WTTVS is introduced in this paper. The subsystem consists of two invar <b>leveling</b> <b>staffs,</b> a laser range finder and an incremental encode, in which the invar <b>leveling</b> <b>staffs</b> and the laser range finder are used to calibrate the encode. At the same time, the uncertainty of the subsystem is evaluated. As the result, the uncertainty is 3. 48 mm (confidence probability is 99 %), which proves the feasibility of the design. Intorduction Metrology of wave measurement instruments and tide gauge is an important task of basic metrology. Now, the task is carried out in two ways: One is indoor test which is to test the instrument or the acceleration sensor in the laboratory; and the other one is field contrast test which is to compare the sample instrument with the standard one on spot. The indoor test in our country(China) is carried on in the National Center Of Ocean Standard And Metrology. JBY 1 - 1 calibration equipment[1, 2] (refer to fig. 1) is used to test the wave buoy, whose height limit is no more than 6 m. Another calibration equipment based on the water tower i...|$|R
30|$|A {{predominant}} morphological {{style of}} the surface rupture was a near-vertical free face of thick unconsolidated sediments and/or soil units involving a tensile (opening) component of up to ~ 1  m and occasionally with a colluvial wedge present. Tilted trees and meter-scale local landslides triggered by fault slip were commonly observed along the rupture zone. Since most of the surface breaks are located on steep slopes in the deep forest and ranches (Fig.  4), we measured vertical offsets using a measuring tape, folding ruler, <b>leveling</b> <b>staff</b> and/or hand-level, which includes approximately ± 10 -cm measurement errors. At key locations, we measured vertical separation by taking surface profile using a laser distance meter (Laser Technology TruPulse 200 X) and a target prism that gives a measurement accuracy of ± 4  cm. There were few observations of man-made features as piercing points, and hence, we could not measure the amount of slip more accurately, in particular lateral slip. The maximum vertical slip of ~ 2.0  m was measured at a 6.7 -km mark (Fig.  3), gradually tapering toward the west and east (Fig.  3 b). But it is comprised of several triangle slip distributions corresponding to several subsections. The throw averages 0.7  m, approximately equivalent to the average right-lateral slip in the strike-slip zone.|$|E
50|$|Invar is used where high {{dimensional}} stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, television shadow-mask frames, valves in engines, and antimagnetic watches. In land surveying, when first-order (high-precision) elevation leveling {{is to be}} performed, the level <b>staff</b> (<b>leveling</b> rod) used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals. Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders.|$|R
