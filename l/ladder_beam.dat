40|$|Locomotor {{impairments}} after {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) are often assessed using open-field rating scales. These tasks {{have the advantage of}} spanning the range from complete paralysis to normal walking; however, they lack sensitivity at specific levels of recovery. Additionally, most supplemental assessments were developed in rats, not mice. For example, the horizontal <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> has been used to measure recovery in the rat after SCI. This parametric task results in a videotaped archival record of the event, is easily administered, and is unambiguously scored. Although a <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> apparatus for mice is available, its use in the assessment of recovery in SCI mice is rare, possibly because normative data for uninjured mice and the type of step misplacements injured mice exhibit is lacking. We report the development of a modified <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> instrument and scoring system to measure hindlimb recovery in vertebral T 9 contusion spinal cord injured mice. The mouse <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> allows for the use of standard parametric statistical tests to assess locomotor recovery. <b>Ladder</b> <b>beam</b> performance is consistent across four strains of mice, there are no sex differences, and inter-rater reliability between observers is high. The <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> score is proportional to injury severity and can be used to easily separate mice capable of weight-supported stance up to mice with consistent forelimb to hindlimb coordination. Critically, horizontal <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> testing discriminates between mice that score identically in terms of stepping frequency in open-field testing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

60|$|Workmen are now {{battering}} and smashing down my theatre here, {{where we}} have just been acting a new play of great merit, done in what I may call (modestly speaking of the getting-up, and not of the acting) an unprecedented way. I believe that anything so complete has never been seen. We had an act at the North Pole, where the slightest and greatest thing the eye beheld were equally taken from the books of the Polar voyagers. Out of thirty people, there were certainly not two who might not have gone straight to the North Pole itself, completely furnished for the winter!

40|$|Traumatic {{injury to}} the brain {{is one of the}} leading causes of injury-related death or disability, but current therapies are limited. Previously it has been shown that the {{antioxidant}} proteins metallothioneins (MTs) are potent neuroprotective factors in animal models of brain injury. The exogenous administration of MTs causes effects consistent with the roles proposed from studies in knock-out mice. We herewith report the results comparing full mouse MT- 1 with the independent alpha and beta domains, alone or together, in a cryoinjury model. The lesion of the cortex caused the mice to perform worse in the horizontal <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> and the rota-rod tests; all the proteins showed a modest effect in the former test, while only full MT- 1 improved the performance of animals in the rota-rod, and the alpha domain showed a rather detrimental effect. Gene expression analysis by RNA protection assay demonstrated that all proteins may alter the expression of host-response genes such as GFAP, Mac 1 and ICAM, in some cases being the beta domain more effective than the alpha domain or even the full MT- 1. A MT- 1 -to-MT- 3 mutation blunted some but not all the effects caused by the normal MT- 1, and in some cases increased its potency. Thus, splitting the two MT- 1 domains do not seem to eliminate all MT functions but certainly modifies them, and different motifs seem to be present in the protein underlying such functions...|$|E
40|$|The sciatic {{functional}} index (SFI) is {{a popular}} parameter for peripheral nerve evaluation that relies on footprints obtained with ink and paper. Drawbacks include smearing artefacts {{and a lack of}} dynamic information during measurement. Modern applications use digitized systems that can deliver results with less analytical effort and fewer mice. However, the systems are expensive (€ 40, 000). This study aimed to evaluate the applicability and precision of a self-made, low-cost infrared system for evaluating SFI in mice. Mice were subjected to unilateral sciatic nerve crush injury (crush group; n = 7) and sham operation (sham group; n = 4). They were evaluated on the day before surgery, the 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th days after injury, and then every day up to the 23 rd day after injury. We compared two SFI evaluation methods, i. e., conventional ink-and-paper SFI (C-SFI) and our infrared system (I-SFI). Our apparatus visualized footprints with totally internally reflected infrared light (950 nm) and a camera that can only detect this wavelength. Additionally we performed an analysis with the <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> walking test (LBWT) as a reference test. I-SFI assessment reduced the standard deviation by about 33 percent, from 11. 6 to 7. 8, and cut the variance around the baseline to 21 percent. The system thus requires fewer measurement repetitions and fewer animals, and cuts the cost of keeping the animals. The apparatus cost € 321 to build. Our results show that the process of obtaining the SFI can be made more precise via digitization with a self-made, low-cost infrared system...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundHuman {{central nervous}} system-stem cells grown as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) self-renew, are multipotent, and have {{potential}} therapeutic applications following {{trauma to the}} spinal cord. We have previously shown locomotor recovery in immunodeficient mice that received a moderate contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) and hCNS-SCns transplantation 9 days post-injury (dpi). Engrafted hCNS-SCns exhibited terminal differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes and synapse-forming neurons. Further, selective ablation of human cells using Diphtheria toxin (DT) abolished locomotor recovery in this paradigm, suggesting integration of human cells within the mouse host as a possible mechanism for the locomotor improvement. However, the hypothesis that hCNS-SCns could alter the host microenvironment as an additional or alternative mechanism of recovery remained unexplored; we tested that hypothesis in the present study. Methods and FindingsStereological quantification of human cells using a human-specific cytoplasmic marker demonstrated successful cell engraftment, survival, migration and limited proliferation in all hCNS-SCns transplanted animals. DT administration at 16 weeks post-transplant ablated 80. 5 % of hCNS-SCns. Stereological quantification for lesion volume, tissue sparing, descending serotonergic host fiber sprouting, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposition, glial scarring, and angiogenesis demonstrated no evidence of host modification within the mouse spinal cord {{as a result of}} hCNS-SCns transplantation. Biochemical analyses supplemented stereological data supporting the absence of neural stem-cell mediated host repair. However, linear regression analysis of the number of engrafted hCNS-SCns vs. the number of errors on a horizontal <b>ladder</b> <b>beam</b> task revealed a strong correlation between these variables (r = − 0. 78, p< 0. 05), suggesting that survival and engraftment were directly related to a quantitative measure of recovery. ConclusionsAltogether, the data suggest that the locomotor improvements associated with hCNS-SCns transplantation were not due to modifications within the host microenvironment, supporting the hypothesis that human cell integration within the host circuitry mediates functional recovery following a 9 day delayed transplant...|$|E

40|$|Building {{structure}} planning {{have to be}} planned properly with the building planning guide that have been decided {{in order to reach}} the factor of strength and security, so that the collapse of the building will never happen as prepared in the planning. So that the hold building {{structure planning}} of 5 floors campus using partial ductile method in the earthquake area 3 is related to the Planning Guide of Concrete Structure for Building (SNI 03 - 2847 - 2002). This building is planned to be build in the earthquake area 3 which consists of hard soil partial ductile system with the value of ductility (μ) = 5 and the factor of earthquake reduction (R) = 8, 0. The planning of the building structure covers upper structure and bellow structure. Upper structure covers about roof planning (easel) and reinforced concrete (floor plate, <b>ladder,</b> <b>beam,</b> and column), thus the below structure covers foundation structure. In analyzing building structure is applied “SAP 2000 v. 14 ” computer program in order to ease and increase in counting. In the other hand the drawing of the planning is using AutoCAD v. 2014 program. The quality of concrete and steel of reinforced concrete is fc’ = 25 MPa, main reinforcement fy = 400 MPa and shear reinforcement fy = 240 MPa. Besides, for the easel steel is using Bj 37 steel quality class with the yield stress = 250 MPa and the basic stress is 160 Mpa. The foundation is using pilling with the depth about 6 metres. The result of the building structure planning are : easel frame structure using 2 L 50. 50. 5, and 2 L 30. 30. 5 profile, using welding tool and 10 mm cusset plate. The thickness of roof plate is 10 cm with the main reinforcement D 10 and the divider reinforcement D 8. The thickness of floor plate is 12 cm with the main reinforcement D 10 and the divider reinforcement D 8. The thickness of ladder plate and bordes are 12 cm with the main reinforcement D 16 and divider reinforcement D 8. The main beam is using 400 / 600 dimension, and planning column is using 600 / 600 dimension. The dimension of the piling is 400 / 400 mm with the main reinforcement D 19 and shear reinforcement 2 dp 6, the poer plate thickness of (3 x 3) m 2 is about 0. 8 m with the main reinforcement D 22 and divider reinforcement D 16, in the other hand the sloof dimension of 350 / 500 is using main reinforcement D 16 and shear reinforcement 2 dp 10...|$|E

40|$|Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) in {{combination}} with rehabilitation {{has been shown to}} promote functional recovery in acute spinal cord injury. For clinical use, the optimal treatment window is concurrent with the beginning of rehabilitation, usually 2 - 4 weeks after injury. We show that ChABC is effective when given 4 weeks after injury combined with rehabilitation. After C 4 dorsal spinal cord injury, rats received no treatment for 4 weeks. They then received either ChABC or penicillinase control treatment followed by hour-long daily rehabilitation specific for skilled paw reaching. Animals that received both ChABC and task-specific rehabilitation showed the greatest recovery in skilled paw reaching, approaching similar levels to animals that were treated at the time of injury. There was also a modest increase in skilled paw reaching ability in animals receiving task-specific rehabilitation alone. Animals treated with ChABC and task-specific rehabilitation also showed improvement in <b>ladder</b> and <b>beam</b> walking. ChABC increased sprouting of the corticospinal tract, and these sprouts had more vGlut 1 (+ve) presynaptic boutons than controls. Animals that received rehabilitation showed an increase in perineuronal net number and staining intensity.
