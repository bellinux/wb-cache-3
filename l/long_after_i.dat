500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> am dead and gone {{and you can tell}} the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if she would like to be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E

60|$|We went to bed. <b>Long</b> <b>after</b> that <b>I</b> {{heard the}} swell and roar and crash and lull {{of the wind}} in the pines, a sound I had learned to love in Buckskin Forest with Buffalo Jones. At last I fell asleep.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1948, as a captain, Griffin {{received}} sudden {{orders to}} report to the Strategic Plans Division (OP-30) in the Department of the Navy as officer in charge of special projects. [...] "That meant practically nothing to me when I heard this. It wasn't too <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> got back there that I got head over heels into the business of the so-called revolt of the admirals -- the B-36 affair. I found that the special projects {{had to do with the}} preparation of statements for the chief of naval operations on very critical points." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo, {{written in}} 1950, Eichelberger wrote, [...] "Buna was ... {{bought at a}} {{substantial}} price in death, wounds, disease, despair, and human suffering. [...] No one who fought there, however hard he tries, will ever forget it." [...] Fatalities, he concluded, [...] "closely approach, percentage-wise, the heaviest losses in our Civil War battles." [...] He also commented, [...] "I am a reasonably unimaginative man, but Buna is still to me, in retrospect, a nightmare. [...] This <b>long</b> <b>after,</b> <b>I</b> can still remember every day {{and most of the}} nights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Veach {{was born}} in Island, Kentucky, in 1888. His family moved to Madisonville, Kentucky, when he was 12 years old. His father was a coal miner, and Veach also began working in the coal mine as a boy. In 1915, Veach recalled: [...] "I started in as a miner when I was {{fourteen}} years old and worked {{at it in the}} winters until a couple years ago, <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> was earning money as a player." [...] At age 17, Veach moved to Herrin, Illinois, where he began playing semi-pro baseball.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear me, yes!" [...] she acquiesced. [...] "You two {{had better}} {{go off and}} have a long country walk. If <b>I</b> sit for <b>long</b> <b>after</b> luncheon, <b>I</b> always go to sleep; so come along, Reginald, we'll beard the lion in his den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{ever want}} to get married until <b>after</b> <b>I</b> met you, and until a <b>long</b> time <b>after</b> <b>I</b> met you. I cottoned to you from the start; but I never thought it would get as bad as marriage. Why, I can't get to sleep nights, {{thinking}} of you and wanting you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Though {{he never}} planned {{to play for}} Michigan, Daley looked back on the {{opportunity}} as a stroke of luck. [...] "I was a lucky guy. [...] I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan {{was one of the}} greatest thrills I could have had. [...] When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world." [...] Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: [...] "It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. [...] Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. [...] Said Daley, [...] "I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the idea}} of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: [...] "I have {{a great number of}} {{scientific}} odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the Siècle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until <b>long</b> <b>after.</b> <b>I</b> carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form." [...] In his April 1873 lecture, [...] "The Meridians and the Calendar", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the international date line had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864). Poe's story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.|$|E
60|$|But the forge was a {{very short}} {{distance}} off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer. <b>Long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> ought to have heard it, and <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of Joe's hammer {{was not in the}} midsummer wind.|$|E
60|$|I fully {{admit the}} man's conduct was not bad: in writing it down so <b>long</b> <b>after</b> the events <b>I</b> can even {{see that it}} was good.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{because you}} were waiting and watching, with nothing to look at: but the tunnel is only {{a mile and a}} quarter <b>long</b> <b>after</b> all, <b>I</b> believe. If you had been looking at fields and hedgerows all the while, you would have thought no time at all had passed.|$|R

60|$|Thomas {{said that}} I was {{probably}} right. I lay awake for a <b>long</b> time <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{went to bed}} that night, thinking of Prissy and Stephen.

It’s an album of extraordinary ambience, rich with Mac Erlaine’s distinctive supple reed work and subtle electronics. With each track Mac Erlaine seems to channel the atmosphere of a space or vista, immersing us. Conceived and recorded in rural Leitrim, <b>Long</b> <b>After</b> The Music <b>Is</b> Gone stands as a meditation on Irish landscape, dipping into the chants of Medieval mystic Hildegard von Bingen and the work of Irish philosopher John O’Donoghue. It’s all in the blood of this record, assimilated into a language of rare elegance and originality.

6000|$|<b>Long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{had gone}} to bed a sudden silence filled the chamber, and I knew that David had awaked. I lay motionless, and, after what seemed a long time of waiting, a little far-away voice said in a {{cautious}} whisper, [...] "Irene!" ...|$|E
60|$|He stood, <b>long</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> {{had ceased}} to read, still looking at me. At length I ventured to take his hand, and to entreat him, as well as I could, to {{endeavour}} to get some command of himself. He replied, 'I thankee, sir, I thankee!' without moving.|$|E
