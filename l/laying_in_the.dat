The next morning, Quetzalcoatl, feeling shame and regret, had his servants build him a stone chest, adorn him in turquoise, and then, <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest, set himself on fire.

500|$|Production {{started from}} December 5, 1994, at Universal Studios. When Shaffer arrived there, {{he found that}} his storyboards were glued on a giant {{blackboard}} along with the schedule for each shot. He also observed {{that many of his}} storyboard ideas had evolved, but they retained the core concepts. The preliminary shots used a Madonna body double and the singer arrived afterwards, proceeding with the shots in a water tank. Filming stopped for few hours when a minor earthquake shook the film studio. Few complications were encountered like Madonna getting dyed in blue color from sitting in the water tank, as well as technical difficulties leading to cancellation of a storyboard showing the singer opening her chest cavity. One shot involving Madonna <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lap of a skeleton had to be postponed since the skeleton was too small for the singer, and had to be rebuilt from scratch. The last scene filmed was the one involving the laboratory where Madonna was shown sleeping in a futuristic dress.

Tom Foden was the video's production designer and it was shot by cinematographer Harris Savides, on 35 mm film lens. Due to the vast number of digital effects required for the video, post-production lasted for weeks. In an interview with Aperture magazine, Madonna revealed the inspiration for the music video: ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained {{about some of the}} lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E

[...] By June of that year, the town had been platted and surveyed from Brown St. in the north to Burlington St. in the south, and from the Iowa River eastward to Governor St.|$|E

6000|$|It may be {{generally}} {{observed that the}} passionateness of the sorrow both of the Virgin and disciples, is represented by Giotto and all great following designers as reaching its crisis at the Entombment, not at the Crucifixion. The expectation that, after experiencing every form of human suffering, Christ would yet {{come down from the}} cross, or in some other visible and immediate manner achieve for Himself the victory, might be conceived to have supported in a measure the minds of those among His disciples who watched by His cross. But when the agony was closed by actual death, and the full strain was put upon their faith, by their <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sepulchre, wrapped in His grave-clothes, Him in whom they trusted, [...] "that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel," [...] their sorrow became suddenly hopeless; a gulf of horror opened, almost at unawares, under their feet; and in the poignancy of her astonied despair, it was no marvel that the agony of the Madonna in the [...] "Pietà" [...] became subordinately associated {{in the mind of the}} early Church with that of their Lord Himself;--a type of consummate human suffering.|$|E

Take a {{small and}} simple photograph; allow {{yourself}} {{half an hour to}} express its subjects with the pen only, using some permanent liquid color instead of ink, outlining its buildings or trees firmly, and <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeper shadows, as you have been accustomed to do in your bolder pen drawings; then, when this etching is dry, take your sepia or gray, and tint it over, getting now the finer gradations of the photograph; and, finally taking out the higher lights with penknife or blotting paper. You will soon find what can be done in this way; and by a series of experiments you may ascertain for yourself how far the pen may be made serviceable to reinforce shadows, mark characters of texture, outline unintelligible masses, and so on. The more time you have, the more delicate you may make the pen drawing, blending it with the tint; the less you have, the more distinct you must keep the two. Practice in this way from one photograph, allowing yourself sometimes only {{a quarter of an hour}} for the whole thing, sometimes an hour, sometimes two or three hours; in each case drawing the whole subject in full depth of light and shade, but with such degree of finish in the parts as is possible in the given time. And this exercise, observe, you will do well to repeat frequently, whether you can get prints and drawings as well as photographs, or not.|$|E
60|$|We {{now made}} sail to the northward, hoping soon {{to get a}} more southerly wind. Towards noon the sea was much smoother, and with a S.S.E. wind we were <b>laying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of Salwatty, which I hoped to reach, as I could there easily get a boat to take provisions and stores to my companion in Mysol. This wind did not, however, last long, but died away into a calm; and a light west wind springing up, with a dark bank of clouds, again gave us hopes of reaching Mysol. We were soon, however, again disappointed. The E.S.E. wind began to blow again with violence, and continued all night in irregular gusts, and with a short cross sea tossed us about unmercifully, and so continually took our sails aback, that we were at length forced to run before it with our jib only, to escape being swamped by our heavy mainsail. After another miserable and anxious night, we found that we had drifted westward of the island of Poppa, and the wind being again a little southerly, we made all sail {{in order to reach}} it. This we did not succeed in doing, passing to the north-west, when the wind again blew hard from the E.S.E., and our last hope of finding a refuge till better weather was frustrated. This was a very serious matter to me, as I could not tell how Charles Allen might act, if, after waiting in vain for me, he should return to Wahai, and find that I had left there long before, and had not since been heard of. Such an event as our missing an island forty miles long would hardly occur to him, and he would conclude either that our boat had foundered, or that my crew had murdered me and run away with her. However, as it was physically impossible now for me to reach him, the only thing to be done was {{to make the best of}} my way to Waigiou, and trust to our meeting some traders, who might convey to him the news of my safety.|$|E
