40|$|<b>Lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{is a new}} {{phosphodiesterase}} Type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor used {{in treatment}} of erectile dysfunction. Objective: The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> after administering ascending (1 - 100 mg) single oral doses to healthy male volunteers (n = 33). Methods: The study was an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase I clinical trial involving the administration of single oral doses of <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate.</b> <b>Lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> was administered sequentially, escalating in single doses of 1 mg - 100 mg with a washout period of at least 1 week between each dose. The progression to the next dose was allowed after clinical and laboratory exams, Ambulatory Monitoring of Arterial Pressure (AMAP) without relevant clinical modifications and adverse events without clinical relevancy. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1, 1. 25, 1. 5, 1. 75, 2, 2. 5, 3, 3. 5, 4, 4. 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 h post-dosing. Plasma samples for measurement of <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> and lodenafil were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Results: No serious adverse events were observed, and none of the subjects discontinued the study due to intolerance. The AMAP measurements, clinical and laboratory exams and ECG revealed no significant changes even at higher doses. <b>Lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> was not detected in any samples, indicating that it acts as a prodrug. The mean lodenafil pharmacokinetic parameters for t(max) and t(1 / 2) were 1. 6 (+/- 0. 4) h and 3. 3 (+/- 1. 1) h, respectively. This study demonstrated that <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> was well tolerated and showed a good safety profile in healthy male volunteers.

40|$|A simple {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE) {{method was}} developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> in tablets. Response surface methodology was used for optimization of the pH and concentration of the buffer, applied voltage and temperature. The method employed 50 mmol L- 1 borate buffer at pH 10 as background electrolyte with an applied voltage of 15 kV. The separation was carried out in a fused-silica capillary maintained at 32. 5 ºC and the detection wavelength was 214 nm. The method was validated showing specificity, linearity (r = 0. 9995), precision (relative standard deviation less than 2 %) and accuracy (99. 95 %). The method proved to be robust by a fractional factorial design evaluation. The proposed CZE method was successfully applied for the quantitative analysis of <b>lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> in tablets and the results compared to the high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods, showed non-significant differences...|$|E

40|$|Oral {{treatment}} with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE 5) {{is considered the}} first-line treatment for patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). <b>Lodenafil</b> <b>carbonate</b> (LC) is a novel PDE 5.

Seventy-two men older than 18 years, with ED for at least 6 months with stable sexual relationship were enrolled.

IIEF erectile domain scores before and after the use of medications were (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) : placebo: 11. 9 +/- 3. 4 and 12. 6 +/- 5. 5; LC 20 mg: 15. 8 +/- 4. 1 and 18. 9 +/- 6. 6; LC 40 mg: 11. 9 +/- 4. 4 and 15. 4 +/- 8. 1; LC 80 mg: 14. 2 +/- 4. 7 and 22. 8 +/- 6. 0 (anova P < 0. 01). the SEP- 2 scores before and after the use of medications were (Mean +/- SD) : placebo: 71. 0 +/- 33. 1 and 51. 2 +/- 43. 1; LC 20 mg 70. 3 +/- 34. 2 and 75. 5 +/- 31. 5; LC 40 mg: 48. 4 +/- 42. 1 and 60. 8 +/- 42. 5; LC 80 mg: 68. 6 +/- 33. 5 and 89. 6 +/- 26. 0. the SEP- 3 scores were: placebo 23. 3 +/- 27. 6 and 33. 6 +/- 42. 3; LC 20 mg: 32. 3 +/- 38. 9 and 51. 2 +/- 41. 7; LC 40 mg: 39. 7 +/- 44. 7 and 46. 7 +/- 41. 1; LC 80 mg* 17. 2 +/- 29. 5 and 74. 3 +/- 36. 4 (*P < 0. 05 for difference to placebo). The drug was well tolerated. Adverse reactions were mild and self-limited and included headache, rhinitis, flushing, color visual disorders, and dyspepsia.

40|$|O objetivo do estudo foi verificar os efeitos do carbonato de lodenafil no processo de consolidaÃÃo Ãssea nos fÃmures de ratos reduzidos com fio de Kirshner. Os fatores vasculares sÃo extremamente importantes para a formaÃÃo do calo Ãsseo. O carbonato de lodenafil causa efeitos vasodilatadores, pertence ao grupo dos inibidores da fosfodiesterase seletiva para o tipo 5 (PDE 5), enzima que hidrolisa monofosfato de guanosina cÃclico (GMPc). O GMPc induz o relaxamento da musculatura lisa, sendo utilizado no tratamento da disfunÃÃo erÃtil. Foram utilizados 36 ratos machos, adultos, da linhagem Wistar, com o peso mÃdio de 300 g. Todos os animais foram submetidos a cirurgia em que era realizada a fratura da diÃfise femoral com uma guilhotina romba. Os animais foram divididos em 2 grupos: o grupo lodenafil, que recebeu, via oral, doses diÃrias de carbonato de lodenafil (10 mg/kg) e o grupo controle. Os animais foram sacrificados com 7, 14 e 28 dias de pÃs-operatÃrio. Houve duas mortes, dois falsos trajetos do fio e em trÃs animais nÃo foi estabelecida a fratura. Foram realizados estudo radiogrÃfico com filme de mamÃgrafo para analisar a densidade Ãptica e Ãrea do calo Ãsseo, medida em mmÂ e estudo histolÃgico, utilizando amostras coradas com picrosirius red sob a luz poralizada do microscÃpio, para quantificar a formaÃÃo de colÃgeno tipo I e tipo III na regiÃo {{cortical}} prÃxima a fratura e no calo Ãsseo. A densidade de colÃgeno tipo I na regiÃo cortical do fÃmur prÃximo Ã fratura verificada no grupo lodenafil foi significantemente menor que a observada no grupo controle com 28 dias de consolidaÃÃo Ãssea (**P = 0, 0028). Os resultados encontrados nÃo sÃo consistentes o suficiente para afirmar que este fÃrmaco exerce algum efeito na consolidaÃÃo Ãssea. Verificou-se que o Carbonato de lodenafil nÃo influenciou no processo de consolidaÃÃo Ãssea nos fÃmures de ratos reduzidos com fio de Kirshner.

The animals were divided into 2 groups: lodenafil group, wich received oral doses of carbonate lodenafil (10 mg/kg) and the control group.

Were performed radiographic studies with film mammography to analyze the optical density and area of callus, measured in mm Â and histological study, using samples stained with picrosirius red under microscope light polarization, to quantify formation of collagen type I and type III in the cortical region near the fracture and callus. The density of type I collagen in the cortical region of the femur near the fracture observed in group lodenafil was significantly lower than that observed in the control group at 28 days of bone (** P = 0. 0028). The results are not consistent enough to say that this drug has an effect on bone healing.

40|$|Introduction. Evidence is accumulating {{to support}} the {{presence}} of erectile dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. This dysregulation may be amenable to therapeutic intervention to improve adherence {{and quality of life}} of patients who suffer from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. Aim. We aimed to evaluate the use of adjunctive medication lodenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in outpatients with schizophrenia and spectrum. Methods. the design was a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial with lodenafil and it was carried at the Schizophrenia Outpatients Program. Main Outcome Measures. the measures used to assess sexual dysfunction were Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) were also used. the measures included the levels of prolactin, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free testosterone, and total testosterone at baseline and end point. Lodenafil and placebo pills were used by the patients for 16 weeks. Results. Fifty male outpatients fulfilled the criteria and 94 % of the participants completed the study. Lodenafil and placebo produced improvement in ASEX, IIEF scale, PANSS, and QLS, and there was no statistical difference between lodenafil and placebo groups in all sexual domains in the results of PANSS and QLS and in the results of hormone levels. Conclusion. These results indicate that both lodenafil and placebo were effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction for schizophrenia. Placebo effect is very important in patients with schizophrenia and this study showed the importance of discussing sexuality and trying to treat these patients. Further studies designed to test treatments of erectile dysfunction in patients who suffer from schizophrenia are necessary. Nunes LVA, Lacaz FS, Bressan RA, Nunes SOVA, and Mari JJ.
