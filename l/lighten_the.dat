5|$|Male {{care for}} infants has been {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse {{was to call}} at Sines, Portugal, to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> load of the ship, {{but poor}} weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E

It does not affect {{chestnut}} (red) coloring. A genetic test exists for the silver gene.|$|R
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E

5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E

We do the finite element analysis for the built 3 d model of the off-road vehicle frame to obtain the stress distribution and the displacement distribution, which can be used as the basis for <b>The</b> <b>Lightening</b> Design of <b>the</b> off-road vehicle frame. On the premise of keeping the general function unchanged, we can achieve <b>the</b> goal of <b>lightening</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, and improving the economy...|$|R

5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E
5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try to pull her off. The attempts to refloat her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf. The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to <b>lighten</b> <b>the</b> ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
