It flies 17 Embraer E-170/E-190 aircraft and two leased Saab 2000. The airline focuses on serving the financial market, {{though it has}} recently expanded into the <b>leisure</b> <b>market,</b> offering routes to Ibiza, Palma and Venice. The onboard product is identical {{to that of the}} BA Short Haul product from both LHR and LGW.|$|E
5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the <b>leisure</b> <b>market</b> between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E
25|$|Qantas {{had also}} {{developed}} a full-service all-economy international carrier focused on the holiday and <b>leisure</b> <b>market,</b> which had taken on the formerly used Australian Airlines name. This airline ceased operating its own-liveried aircraft in July 2006, with the staff operating Qantas services before being closed entirely in September 2007, with the staff joining the new Qantas base in Cairns.|$|E

25|$|In September 2016, MEGA Maldives {{announced}} to cut 65 of its 400 staff {{as well as}} postponing planned new routes until further notice due to the severely decreased Chinese <b>leisure</b> <b>market.</b> In the same month, the airline introduced its first Boeing 737-800 on wetlease from Travel Service. The aircraft is part of its fleet modernization program and {{will be used for}} increased connectivity between short and medium ranged destinations, notably opening up new destinations in India and Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|Tourism plays a {{major part}} in the Cairns economy. According to Tourism Australia, the Cairns region is the fourth-most-popular {{destination}} for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. While the city does not rank amongst Australia's top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts {{a significant number of}} Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals. There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese <b>leisure</b> <b>market</b> with occasional direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. During the 2013 Chinese Lunar New Year period alone, Cairns saw 20,000 Chinese holidaymakers flying in on chartered flights.|$|E
25|$|During 2003 SAS was {{undergoing}} a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing unit costs. As {{part of this}} work, the company's management in cooperation with McKinsey & Company devised a scheme to better target the <b>leisure</b> <b>market.</b> Inspiration was both gathered from Ryanair and SAS' partner airline Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also cleared {{out most of the}} Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, and was especially concerned with Ryanair and EasyJet.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{the route}} Oslo–Bergen had 1,680,000 passengers, {{making it the}} second busiest route in Norway (after Oslo–Trondheim). It was in 2007 the seventh-busiest route in Europe. The routes from Bergen to Stavanger and Trondheim are the busiest routes in Norway which do not operate through Oslo. Norwegian and SAS nearly split the Oslo market evenly, {{although}} SAS has 54 percent of the business market and Norwegian 58 percent of the <b>leisure</b> <b>market.</b> Since 2003, the percentage of passengers traveling from Bergen who are dependent on transferring abroad before reaching their ultimate destination has fallen from about 60 percent to below 40 percent.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002 Maersk {{had seen}} {{competition}} in the scheduled market from Sterling, which had reorganized itself as a low-cost carrier targeting the Mediterranean <b>leisure</b> <b>market.</b> In 2005 Fred. Olsen & Co. sold the airline to FL Group, an Icelandic holding group which also owned among others Icelandair. The Maersk Group announced on 30 June 2005 that it would sell Maersk Air to Sterling. Star Air and the corporate jet were {{kept out of the}} deal. Ownership of the 737 was also not included, and instead there were leased to Sterling. The sales price of Maersk Air was never made public.|$|E
25|$|The HS1 {{line was}} {{finished}} {{on time and}} under budget. The reduction in journey times and increase in reliability achieved through the opening of Section 1 enabled Eurostar to capture 71% of the total London–Paris market and over 80% of the <b>leisure</b> <b>market</b> and Section 2 has increased these figures further. Additionally, the connections provided to the WCML, MML and ECML by Section 2 may see growth of hitherto marginal markets, by finally allowing Regional Eurostars to operate, {{at least on the}} electrified ECML and WCML. Eurostar's chief executive stated that the company believes it can take 50% market share even on 4½-hour journeys, a journey time that would put Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds within reach of mainland Europe.|$|E
50|$|A {{mainline}} {{flight is}} a flight operated by an airline's main operating unit, {{rather than by}} regional alliances, regional code-shares, regional subsidiaries, or wholly owned subsidiaries offering low-cost operations. Mainline carriers typically operate between hub airports within their network and on international or long-haul services, using narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. This {{is in contrast to}} regional airlines, providing feeder services to hub airports operating smaller turboprop or regional jet aircraft, or low-cost carrier subsidiaries serving <b>leisure</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, a small {{business}} owned by Kenneth and Helen Walker called “$3.99 Car Rentals” opened its doors to serve the large military population in San Antonio, Texas. Founded with a fleet of five cars and initially serving the government traveler, it expanded very quickly over the next 20 years into feeder and <b>leisure</b> <b>markets</b> including local retail and airport markets located throughout the Western United States. During the 1960s and 70s, the company grew through the acquisition of several different franchises. The operation was later consolidated in 1984 under the name [...] "Advantage Rent a Car." [...] As the 1990s progressed, expansion of the Advantage brand continued throughout the U.S. into the Sunbelt states and major <b>leisure</b> airport <b>markets.</b> In 2001, Advantage attained worldwide presence by launching an affiliate partnership program that grew to an international network serving more than 33 countries. In 2006, {{following the death of}} Kenneth Walker, the Walker heirs sold the business to Venture Holding Inc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} methodologies for analysing {{the existence}} of limits to growth of leisure air travel and defines the concept of demand maturity. It considers the air market {{as one of a}} number of inter-related travel markets and applies these concepts to a UK case study. The paper concludes that the UK air international <b>leisure</b> travel <b>market</b> is only at the early stages of maturity; whilst the overall <b>leisure</b> travel <b>market</b> seems to be much nearer to full maturity. This means that if UK air travel is still to experience healthy growth rates, it must be at the expense of the growth of some other UK travel market...|$|R
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the <b>leisure</b> <b>market</b> and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the Seibu Group {{collapsed}} due to {{the revelation}} {{that the head of}} Kokudo (the predecessor of Seibu Holdings), Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, had falsified financial statements for over forty years. The scandal, which involved falsifying the ownership of Kokudo's share holdings in Seibu Railway, was compounded by the increased competition faced by Prince Hotels in the hotel and <b>leisure</b> <b>market</b> as well as an additional pay-off scandal involving a corporate racketeer. Seibu Railway was consequently delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2004 after shares fell to ¥400 from a peak of ¥8000. As a response to this, Seibu Holdings was founded on February 3, 2006 with the aim of restructuring the group following an investment of ¥100 billion from the American private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. [...] Tsutsumi, having pleaded guilty to the fraud charges in 2005, retained a 5% stake in Seibu Holdings having previously owned a 36% stake in Kokudo.|$|E

[...] Their first major contract resulted from winning the competition in 1871 {{for the design of}} Cambridge Hall (1873–74) in Southport, Lancashire. [...] This commission led to the firm being appointed as architects to the Southport Pavilion and Winters Garden Company, for whom they designed the Southport Winter Gardens (1874), the first such building for the seaside <b>leisure</b> <b>market.</b> [...] James Maxwell became director of the St Annes on Sea Land and Building Company and the partnership became its architects and agents. [...] They worked with the Clifton family of Lytham Hall in designing the layout of the resort, and in designing houses, hotels, and the promenade in 1874–77. [...] The practice continued to undertake local commissions, and they also took part in competitions for larger works. [...] In 1883 they won the competition for the design of the Ulster Reform Club in Belfast (1883–85), and came second in the competition for Belfast Central Library.|$|E
