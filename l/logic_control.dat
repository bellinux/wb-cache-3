40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{suitable}} controller for Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) {{is designed for}} improving the power quality. Power Quality {{has become a major}} issue in the present power system network. The network complexity is increasing more rapidly and most of the loads are inductive in nature which draws more reactive power. This causes harmonics and voltage variations in power system. To maintain the proper operation of inter-connected power system, we are using one of the FACTS devices such as DSTATCOM. It provides suitable compensation and thereby maintains the desired power factor, voltage and also reduce the harmonic content in distribution network. The fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>controlled</b> block diagram for DSTATCOM which is optimized using GA is incorporated and also it has been simulated. A comparative study of PI <b>controlled</b> and Fuzzy <b>Logic</b> <b>Controlled</b> DSTATCOM is also made. The simulation is taken out by MATLAB/SIMULINK and the result shows the effectiveness of GA optimized Fuzzy controlled DSTATCOM for improvement of power quality...|$|R
40|$|The <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> {{implemented}} in {{building automation systems}} (BAS) has {{a significant impact on}} the overall energy demand of the building. However, information on the <b>control</b> <b>logic,</b> if documented, is often concealed from further data integration and reuse in heterogeneous information silos using disparate data formats. In particular, existing data formats and information models offer limited support to describe <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> explicitly. Ontology-based modeling of the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> of BAS can potentially result in a versatile source of information for information-driven processes to further increase the performance of technical equipment in a building. Therefore, we present a novel information model, CTRLont, which allows to formally specify the domain of <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> in BAS. We demonstrate the usefulness of the novel information model by using it as a knowledge base for automating rule-based verification of designed <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> in BAS.

40|$|In {{the present}} global economy the {{manufacturing}} industry {{is faced with}} the challenges {{that need to be}} overcome in order to remain competitive and avoid outsourcing. One of the challenges is the efficient development of the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> for the distributed control systems that are often used to control the manufacturing equipment in the industry. Formal methods are mathematical frameworks that might be useful for overcoming that challenge. The <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> is often developed using the IEC 61131 standard that is focused on programming languages for non-distributed control systems. However, the new IEC 61499 standard provides the communication support as well as the programming units, i. e. function blocks, that are aimed at the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> development for the distributed control systems. In the thesis, it is shown that the unclear specification of the function block scheduling order in the IEC 61499 might result in the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> not being portable across IEC 61499 implementations. Therefore, the block scheduling order has to be considered during the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> development. As a consequence, the developers might lose the focus on the high-level <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> that may result in the time-consuming development. The thesis presents contributions that may help the automatic formal model generation of the IEC 61499 <b>control</b> <b>logic,</b> assuming different block scheduling orders. The generated formal models may be used for verification of the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> behavior using the algorithms of the framework called supervisory control theory (SCT). A synthesis algorithm from the SCT is used in the thesis for calculation of all deadlock free block scheduling orders from the automatically generated formal models. The contributions may help developers to concentrate on the high-level <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> since {{they may be able to}} use the formal methods to reduce the possible impact that the block scheduling orders, used in different IEC 61499 implementations, might have on the correctness of their <b>control</b> <b>logic.</b> Therefore, the developers may receive some benefits of the formal methods for the efficient development of the IEC 61499 <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> for the distributed control systems...|$|R
