40|$|The use of {{cyanoacrylate}} (CA) as a fuming {{technique for}} the development of latent friction ridge skin impressions has been widespread for decades within the forensic lab {{as well as in the}} field at crime scenes. Important features of processing <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> using this method include that it makes visible <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> that for the most part cannot be seen with the unaided eye and it preserves <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> for future processing/examination. The superglue fumes "fix" the <b>latent</b> print <b>impression</b> to the substrate making it difficult to wipe away, thereby decreasing the chances of destruction during packaging at the scene, transportation, and processing in the lab. One of the disadvantages to this technique is the lack of contrast between the white polymers that are formed on the <b>latent</b> print <b>impression</b> residue and light colored backgrounds on which the <b>latent</b> print <b>impression</b> may be present. Attempts were made to develop a one-step cyanoacrylate fuming method that would enhance visualization of <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> on light colored backgrounds without the need for an alternative light source, dye staining, or powdering. <b>Latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> were applied to black and white ceramic tiles, white painted wood and white/translucent textured plastic. Protein and hemoglobin stains, commercial colorants, sublimation dyes, hair dye, and printer ink were added to ethyl-CA in an attempt to create a co-polymerization process of the vaporized cyanoacrylate monomers and colorant molecules on latent print residue. Fuming was also attempted using pre-colored commercial glues with the assumption that the attached CA polymers on the <b>latent</b> print <b>impression</b> residue would retain their original color properties. None of these methods proved successful. The practical use of a new fluorescent CA, Lumicyano^TM, was also examined. Following fuming, an ALS is utilized for the excitation of the developed <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> using this technique. Strong fluorescence could not be observed on all substrates. In this particular study, fuming with traditional CA followed by the application of powder or dye stains to <b>latent</b> print <b>impressions</b> currently appears to be the most efficient technique for latent print enhancement on the white or light colored substrates used in this study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{cases such as}} Commonwealth v Patterson {{show that}} {{there is a lack of}} {{research}} in how to process and recognize simultaneous fingerprint impressions, especially when none of the latent prints in the cluster could be individually matched. SWGFAST released the first version of the standard on simultaneous impression examination that can help fingerprint examiners to systematically compare <b>latent</b> simultaneous <b>impressions</b> to a known ten-print card. However, when the individual is not known, the simultaneous fingerprint impressions have to be compared using a large database of reference ten-prints, making the process very challenging. This paper introduces the research problem of identifying simultaneous <b>latent</b> fingerprint <b>impressions</b> to the community and presents a semi-automatic approach to process the impressions of any individual. The approach generates a list of top matches and latent fingerprint examiners can then examine them for individualization. Using a fingerprint database that contains simultaneous <b>latent</b> <b>impressions,</b> we analyze the performance of the proposed approach obtained by matching simultaneous impressions with the gallery database.

50|$|In {{the first}} stage of yogic practice, the soul detaches its {{consciousness}} from the external world and associates itself with the subtle body. In the next stage the mind, intellect and Pranas are left behind and then there is dissociation from the subtle body also. Subsequently, the soul dissociates itself from all its relationship with the three Gunas of Prakriti and then the causal body is separated from it. In this yogic state, the soul acquires unlimited strength and brilliance. For attainment of peace and bliss, the soul must be free not only from the physical association, but also from the <b>latent</b> <b>impressions</b> of this association.|$|R

This study tested the reliability of a fingerprint scanner in accessing enrolled fingerprint data, when faced with the challenge of fake fingerprints. Ridge detail casts were crafted from moulds, with Gelatine and Silicone being applied as casting agents. The second stage required participants to place fingerprints on a bottle or tile; these <b>latent</b> <b>impressions</b> were subsequently powdered using Magneta Flake. Provil, a forensic casting material was applied directly onto the powder, creating simulated fingerprints from a latent print. Each of the produced fingerprints then went through a scanning process.

30|$|Multimetal {{deposition}} is {{a versatile}} technique of detecting latent fingerprints on porous items, for example, fabric tape, masking tape, cardboard; on semi-porous items, for example, expanded polystyrene, latex gloves, waxed paper; {{as well as}} on non-porous items, for example, metals and plastics. It is so named because it is a two-step process, the first involves deposition of gold and the second deposition of silver on the ridges, thereby visualizing the <b>latent</b> <b>impressions.</b> Although a technique with a very wide range of applications, multimetal deposition is not very popular since the process of detecting fingerprints is quite cumbersome. In its modified form, called multimetal deposition II, some of the demerits of the original method are overcome. Multimetal deposition III and IV endeavor to further improve the performance of this technique. Yet another modification of the original multimetal deposition version is the fluorescent multimetal deposition - a technique which produces a better contrast of the ridges vis-à-vis the background.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of personal values on intended selfpresentation during job interviews among German, Ghanaian, Norwegian, and Turkish students (total N = 1, 474). We also sought to explain cultural differences in self-presentation among these groups. The Cultural Impression Management Scale for applicants (CIM-A) and the Portrait Values Questionnaire were administered. A multigroup MIMIC model with invariant measurement and structural weights was supported, in which achievement, security, and benevolence values predicted a <b>latent</b> <b>impression</b> management factor. Intended impression management scores were significantly higher in the Ghanaian and Turkish samples than in the Norwegian and German samples. Values (achievement and security) accounted for 19. 6 per cent of the cross-cultural differences in self-presentation. Adding acquiescence as an additional predictor (interpreted here {{as a measure of}} communication style) decreased the cross-cultural differences by 52. 8 per cent. It is concluded that values are similarly related to intended self-presentation across these four groups, even though the cross-cultural differences in mean scores in both sets of variables were considerable.
