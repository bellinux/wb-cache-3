25|$|Bumastus {{could also}} curl up (known as enrollment) into a ball-like shape. This is {{believed}} to indicate that its habitat {{might have been the}} shallow waters of the Littoral zone. When waves wash them out from the sediments it could simply roll up and be carried along. Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> to wave action.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended to follow the line of <b>least</b> <b>resistance,</b> twisting and turning to avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a difficult area to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected the condition of the pathway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{characterization of the}} effects of intra-gate resistive open defects on nanoscaled CMOS gates as causing faults with timing and pattern sequence dependency. The values of the <b>least</b> detectable <b>resistance</b> are established for different feature sizes using HSPICE. It is found that as the feature size is reduced, the value of the <b>least</b> detectable <b>resistance</b> increases {{in the presence of a}} fault resulting in a delay of less than one nanosecond. The use of a low voltage testing technique is investigated for the detection of these faults. Finally, an analytical model that takes into account the gate current is proposed; this model considers the pronounced effect of the gate current at a decreasing feature size, while incurring in a small error compared with simulation results.

25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E
500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V.

[...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down the path of <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that {{spends a lot of time}} addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E

Materials and Methods: A total of 60, noncarious extracted maxillary premolars were selected and divided into four groups, consisting of 15 teeth each [...] group A: "Mesio-occlusal" preparation, group B: "slot" preparation (conventional grooves), group C: "box-only" preparation (long grooves), group D: "MOD" cavity preparation. All the specimens were subjected to compressive axial load in triaxial testing machine at a cross head speed of 1. 2 mm/min at an inclination of 13. 5 °. Results: Group A ("Mesio-occlusal") preparation had the <b>least</b> fracture <b>resistance</b> value and group D ("MOD") cavity preparation had the highest fracture resistance.

40|$|The {{development}} of a lightweight composite (LC) based on Portland cement concrete with waste lightweight aggregate (WLA) additive was carried out to improve the sustainability and environmental impact and to offer potential cost savings without sacrificing strength. Treatment of {{the surface of the}} LC exposed to environmental attack by coating with biopolymer based on waste cooking oil doped with titanium dioxide photocatalysis (TOP) with superhydrophilic property was found to affect the mechanical properties of the LC in a systematic way. The results of compressive strength showed that the composite achieved the minimum required strength for lightweight construction materials of 17. 2 [*]MPa. Scratch resistance measurements showed that the highest percentages loading of superhydrophilic particles (up to 2. 5 % of biomonomer weight) for LC's surface coating gave the highest scratch resistance while the uncoated sample showed the <b>least</b> <b>resistances.</b> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures revealed the difference between the surface roughness for LC with and without TOP coating. TOP is also formulated to provide self-cleaning LC surfaces based on two principal ways: (1) the development by coating the LC with a photocatalytic superhydrophilic, (2) if such a superhydrophilic is illuminated by light, the grease, dirt, and organic contaminants will be decomposed and can easily be swept away by rain...|$|R

2500|$|The Santa Anas are {{katabatic}} winds—Greek for [...] "flowing downhill", arising {{in higher}} altitudes and blowing down towards sea level. Santa Ana winds originate from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast}} of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down {{the eastern side of the}} Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. Cool, dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This cool, dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the path of <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore.|$|E

Their Arcos did not materialize; actual Arcos building in Kitai-gorod was designed and built by former neoclassicist Vladimir Mayat in moderate [...] "constructive style".|$|E

2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an IV fluid or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes the path of <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close {{and the only way}} for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of hyaluronidase can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration {{is one of the most}} common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E
