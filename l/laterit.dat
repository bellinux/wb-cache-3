5|$|In 2005, {{the group}} {{took part in}} a movie, Mahaleo, that {{describes}} its own history and provides a contemporary view of Madagascar. The 102-minute Malagasy and French language film was directed by Marie-Clémence Paes and Raymond Rajaonarivelo with support from producers in Belgium, France and Madagascar. The film depicts daily life in Madagascar and for each of the band's members, as well as live performances of the band's greatest hits. A live concert DVD produced by <b>Laterit</b> Productions and released in 2007 compiles highlights from the band's 35th anniversary performances at the Olympia theater in Paris; the disc features the subtitled transcription of each song's lyrics in Malagasy, French and English. The band has also been the subject of two books. The first, La Saga Mahaleo, is a detailed history of the band and its members written in 2007 by Randy Donny. The second, entitled Mahaleo, 40 ans d'histoire(s) de Madagascar, was authored by Fanny Pigeaud in 2010; it explores Madagascar's history since independence through interviews with the band members, who recount their own experiences and ways that current events influenced their music.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical Transistor(ECT) was {{reported}} by David Nilsson in 2002. <b>Later,its</b> dimensios were specified and a SPICE model was developed. The main purpose of this diploma work is to check the performance of electrochemical transistors in amplifier circuits. Simple amplifier circuits were simulated using SPICE model of ECT. Lateral and Vertical structures of electrochemical transistors were patterned on orgacon sheet(provided by AGFA),with various electrolytes(EG 010,MS-HEC & MS-L). Characteric curves and time responses of these transistors were studied and then were then used as an active component in single amplifier circuits. Screen printed ECT's were also checked with the best available electrolyte. Behaviour of self made and screen printed ECT's were compared {{on the basis of}} on-off ratio,slew rate,frequency response and gain. Screen printed transistors showed promising results having less deterioration with time  but  till  an  an  input  signal  frequency  of  2 Hz  only. Mismatch with simulation results and Shockley's equation were other findings after data analysis. <img src="file:///C:/DOCUME% 7 E 1 /zia/LOCALS% 7 E 1 /Temp/moz-screenshot- 1. jpg" /...|$|R

50|$|The US {{stock market}} peaked in October 2007, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average index {{exceeded}} 14,000 points. It then entered a pronounced decline, which accelerated markedly in October 2008. By March 2009, the Dow Jones average {{had reached a}} trough of around 6,600. Four years <b>later,it</b> hit an all-time high. It is probable, but debated, that the Federal Reserve's aggressive policy of quantitative easing spurred the partial recovery in the stock market.|$|E
5000|$|The Seeds {{released}} [...] "(You're) Pushin' Too Hard" [...] as {{a single}} in November 1965.Though the song did not chart initially, a Los Angeles disc jockey began playing it extensively following {{the release of the}} band's self-titled debut album in April 1966.With the title having been changed to [...] "Pushin' Too Hard", a new single was issued in November and the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart a month <b>later.It</b> peaked at number 36 in February and spent 11 weeks on the chart.|$|E

5000|$|Bishopstoke, {{a village}} {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book, is a civil parish in the borough of Eastleigh in Hampshire, England. At the 2011 Census the village was a civil parish in its own name. Bishopstoke was also mentioned when King Alfred the Great's grandson King Eadred, granted land at [...] "Stohes" [...] to Thegn Aelfric in 948 AD. The village is about a mile east of Eastleigh town centre, {{and is on the}} eastern bank of the River Itchen. It adjoins Fair Oak on the east, in the Fair Oak and Horton Heath parish. The village was annexed to Eastleigh in 1932, and was split out again as an independent civil parish <b>later.It</b> forms part of the Southampton Urban Area.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, for 41% of cases, {{secondary}} social sharing occurred {{the very}} same day as the primary social sharing situation. Yet secondary sharing {{is not necessarily a}} short-lived occurrence; participants reported that they sometimes still talked about the episode several times, and sometimes talked about it several months <b>later.It</b> is {{important to point out that}} the secondary social sharing is not limited to negative emotional episodes, but instead can occur after positive emotional episodes as well. In one study, 83% of the participants reported some degree of secondary social sharing in response to both positive and negative emotional situation, with no differences found between these two valences. However, there were some qualitative differences between secondary sharing for each: for positive emotional episodes, secondary social sharing was initiated faster and with a higher number of repetitions and targets than for negatives emotional episodes.|$|E

5000|$|Nikolai Polikarpov {{was arrested}} by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of {{industrial}} sabotage for these failures and sentenced to death, although this was commuted to ten years imprisonment in a labor camp. In December 1929 the OGPU gathered a number of aircraft engineers together at Butyrka prison, including Polikarpov, and formed the Internal Prison Design Bureau (Konstruktorskoye Byuro Vnutrenniya Tyurma—KB VT) {{under the leadership of}} Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich. The KB VT was transferred to quarters on the grounds of Factory (Zavod) Nr. 30 in Moscow-Khodinka in early 1930. Shortly afterwards Polikarpov replaced Grigorovich as the head designer when his concept for the I-5 was approved by the OGPU. The full-scale mock-up was approved on 28 March 1930 and the first prototype, designated VT-11 (Vnutrenniya Tyurma—Internal Prison), was completed a month <b>later.It</b> made its first flight on 30 April 1930 and was fitted with an imported supercharged [...] Jupiter VII. It was painted in silver with a red cheat line; a red [...] "VT" [...] was superimposed on the red star on the rudder. The second prototype, known as the VT-12, had a Jupiter VI engine, and took to the air on 22 May, bearing the name [...] "Klim Voroshilov." [...] The two prototypes also differed in minor details regarding the shape of the tail and the construction of the landing gear. All this meant a slight difference in weight and performance between the two prototypes was present, with the second being slightly heavier and faster, while the first had a slight range advantage and a higher service ceiling. The third prototype, designated as the VT-13 and inscribed with [...] "A Gift for the XVIth Congress of the Party", was powered by a [...] Soviet-built M-15 engine with a NACA cowling, but this proved to be unreliable and was not put into production.|$|E

An emphasis is directed at looking at effectiveness of organic and inorganic - based nutrients in that process using a method of bio-stimulation. An in-situ test was undertaken in a coastal area, by making multiple trial compartments, with a size of 0. 5 × 0. 5 m 2 each; and the space between the compartments.

This ERT data then correlated with drill core data or test pit for geological interpretation on identify nickel laterite profile.
