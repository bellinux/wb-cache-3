One can use dynamo scaling relations developed by Christensen and Aubert (2006) to decide whether dynamo extinction through a change in conductive heat transport is possible.

40|$|A {{simplified}} 2 D axisymmetric {{model and}} a comprehensive 3 D weld pool model, {{accounting for the}} free surface deformation and the filler metal addition, {{have been developed to}} investigate the factors that lead to asymmetric bead shapes in horizontal GTA welding of stainless steels. Buoyancy-induced flow and the sagging of the pool free surface, under the action of gravity, are found to be responsible for the weld asymmetry and the decrease in the weld penetration at the bottom sidewall. The numerical results clearly emphasized the beneficial role of the Marangoni shear stress in limiting the asymmetry of horizontal GTA welds.

40|$|Ultrathin {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) of Mo and W show {{great potential for}} digital electronics and optoelectronic applications. Whereas early studies were limited to mechanically exfoliated flakes, the large-area synthesis of 2 D TMDCs has now been realized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) based on a sulfurization reaction. Since then, the optoelectronic properties of CVD grown monolayer MoS_ 2 have been heavily investigated, but the influence of stoichiometry on the electrical and optical properties has been largely overlooked. Here we systematically vary the stoichiometry of monolayer MoS_ 2 during CVD via controlled sulfurization and investigate the associated changes in photoluminescence and electrical properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to measure relative variations in stoichiometry and the persistence of MoO_x species. As MoS_ 2 -δ is reduced (increasing δ), the field-effect mobility of monolayer transistors increases while the photoluminescence yield becomes non-uniform. Devices fabricated from monolayers with the <b>lowest</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>content</b> have negligible hysteresis and a threshold voltage of 0 V.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact {{resulting from the}} release of trace elements during coal combustion {{is an important issue}} for the coal-fired electric utility industry. Trace elements exit the combustor by partitioning between the flue gas and the fly ash particles. A comprehensive study has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms governing the partitioning of trace elements during pulverized coal combustion. The behavior of seven trace elements (arsenic, selenium, antimony, cobalt, cesium, thorium, and cerium) in six pulverized coals were studied under commercially relevant conditions in a well-described laboratory combustion environment. The partitioning of trace elements is governed by the extent of volatilization during combustion, the form of occurrence in the flue gas, and the mechanisms controlling vapor-to-solid phase transformation to fly ash particle surfaces. The most common vapor-to-solid phase partitioning mechanism for semi-volatile trace elements is reaction with active fly ash surfaces. Trace elements that form oxy-anions upon volatilization (e. g. arsenic, selenium, antimony) will react with active calcium and iron cation fly ash surface sites. Trace elements that form simple oxides upon volatilization (e. g. cobalt, cesium) will react with active aluminum oxy-anion fly ash surface sites. The maximum combustion temperature affects the availability of active calcium and iron surface sites but not aluminum sites. Sulfur inhibits the reactivity of oxy-anions with iron surface sites. For coals with high <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> (> 1 wt % as SO₂), volatilized trace elements that form oxy-anions will partition by reaction with calcium surface sites if sufficient sites are available. For coals with <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents,</b> volatilized trace elements that form oxy-anions, will partition by reaction with iron surface sites. Volatilized trace elements that form oxy-anions will not partition by reaction if the coal <b>sulfur</b> <b>content</b> is high and the calcium content is low (< 3 wt% as CaO). Transition metals (e. g. cobalt) may form simple oxides, oxy-anions or both upon volatilization. An appreciable fraction of trace elements with limited volatility (e. g. cobalt, thorium, cerium, cesium) will volatilize. These will partition back to the solid phase by homogeneous nucleation or surface reaction depending upon the post-combustion conditions present...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} {{components of}} a jet turbine engine are made from nickel-base superalloys. These components {{must be able to}} withstand high stresses, fatigue, and corrosive reactions with high-temperature gases. Such oxidation resistance is associated with slow-growing Al 2 O 3 scales that remain adherent to superalloy components after many thermal cycles. Historically, good oxidation resistance has been obtained by coating these components with Ni-Cr-Al-Y coatings, where small additions of yttrium (Y) were necessary for scale adhesion. Subsequently, {{it was found that the}} Y aids scale adhesion by preventing sulfur from segregating to the scale metal interface and thus preventing the sulfur from weakening the oxide-metal bonds. Y is a difficult element to incorporate in single-crystal superalloy castings, but it was shown in early work at the NASA Lewis Research Center that good adhesion could be obtained for low-sulfur, uncoated, singlecrystal superalloys, without Y additions. <b>Low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> for these uncoated superalloys were achieved in the laboratory by a high-temperature hydrogen annealing process. This process allows segregation and surface cleaning of sulfur monolayers in a reducing environment. Another approach is to remove sulfur from the alloy in the melting process. The present study was designed to establish a guideline for the minimum level of desulfurization needed to achieve maximum performance. Coupons of various thicknesses of the superalloy PWA 1480 were hydrogen annealed at various times (8 to 100 hr) and temperatures (1000 to 1300 C), resulting in coupons with <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> ranging from about 0. 05 to 5 ppm. Cyclic oxidation tests at 1100 C were then used to assess adhesion and spalling. The weight change of one set of 20 -mil (0. 5 -mm) samples, annealed for 20 hr at 1000, 1100, 1200, and 1300 C, is shown in the following figure. Clearly, the effect of the annealing temperature is quite dramatic in that the higher temperatures produced scales that spalled very little, whereas the lower temperatures resulted in severe weight losses comparable to those for the as-received, unannealed sample...|$|R
30|$|The clearest {{evidence}} for stratification {{is the presence}} of an inner core. Figure  5 shows that crystallization at the base of Mars’ core occurs only at low temperatures below ∼ 1420 K. At these temperatures, Fe would already be snowing from the CMB region, forming the stratified layer. Hence, if an inner core exists, the core must be stratified (with the proviso that S is the major alloying element and present in the concentration range of 11 – 17 wt%). It is possible to stratify without an inner core if the CMB temperature is less than ∼ 1850 K at the <b>lowest</b> expected <b>sulfur</b> <b>content,</b> 11 wt%, but this lies well below the limits found by geophysical modeling (Rivoldini et al. 2011). In the range 11 – 14 wt% sulfur, an effectively pure iron inner core could form below a substantially stratified liquid in the temperature range 1375 – 1575 K enriched in sulfur by up to 2.5 wt% over the bulk core content.|$|R
40|$|The <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>sulfur</b> isotopic {{compositions}} of 24 glassy submarine volcanics {{from the}} Mariana Island Arc and back-arc Mariana Trough were determined {{in order to}} investigate the hypothesis that subducted seawater sulfur ([delta] 34 S = 21 [per mille sign]) is recycled through arc volcanism. Our results for sulfur {{are similar to those}} for subaerial arc volcanics: Mariana Arc glasses are enriched in 34 S ([delta] 34 S = up to 10. 3 [per mille sign], mean = 3. 8 [per mille sign]) and depleted in S (20 - 290 ppm, MEAN = 100 ppm) relative to MORB (850 ppm S, [delta] 34 S = 0. 1 +/- 0. 5 [per mille sign]). The back-arc trough basalts contain 200 - 930 ppm S and have [delta] 34 S values of 1. 1 +/- 0. 5 [per mille sign], which overlap those for the arc and MORB. The <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> of the arc and some of the trough glasses are attributed to (1) early loss of small amounts of sulfur through separation of immiscible sulfide and (2) later vapor-melt equilibrium control of <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents</b> and loss of sulfur in a vapor phase from sulfide-undersaturated melts near the minimum in sulfur solubility at [function of (italic small f) ]O 2 [approximate] NNO (nickel-nickel oxide). Although these processes removed sulfur from the melts their effects on the sulfur isotopic compositions of the melts were minimal. Positive trends of [delta] 34 S with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, LILE and LREE contents of the arc volcanics are consistent with a metasomatic seawater sulfur component in the depleted sub-arc mantle source. The lack of a 34 S-rich slab signature in the trough lavas may be attributed to equilibration of metasomatic fluid with mantle material along the longer pathway from the slab to the source of the trough volcanics. Sulfur is likely to have been transported into the mantle wedge by metasomatic fluid derived from subducted sediments and pore fluids. Gases extracted from vesicles in arc and back-arc samples are predominantly H 2 O, with minor CO 2 and traces of H 2 S and SO 2. CO 2 in the arc and back-arc rocks has [delta] 13 C values of - 2. 1 to - 13. 1 [per mille sign], similar to MORB. These data suggest that degassing of CO 2 could explain the slightly lower [delta] 13 C values for some Mariana Trough volcanic glasses, and that incorporation of subduction-derived organic carbon into the Mariana Trough mantle source may not be necessary. More analyses are required to resolve this question, however...|$|R

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of fossil}} fuels {{for the production of}} energy has already resulted in significant modifications of the earth's environment, primarily through the emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. The modern world primary energy consumption patterns and its trends lead to the utilization of dirtier and more expensive fossil fuels. The desire to protect the environment is contradictory Lo such structural changes in energy like the broader use of coal as substitution for liquid fuels, taking into account the depletion of coal deposits with <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>contents.</b> Previous studies carried out at IIASA, in the FRG, the US, the USSR and other countries, formulate one long-term technological strategy that might limit pollutant emissions sufficiently to permit an efficient and ecologically sustainable development of the world's energy consumption patterns. This technological strategy is based on the implementation of the so-called Integrated Energy Systems (IES) or Integrated Energy-Chemical Systems (IECS). The basic idea of IES incorporates the decomposition and purification of primary fossil energy inputs before combustion, the integration of these decomposed (clean) products and the allocation of them in line with the requirements for final energy. Thus, Integrated Energy Systems represent a concept for providing a flexible range of final energy forms from varying inputs of different primary energy sources. Other potential advantages include improved performance of the whole energy system, such as higher efficiencies and lower environmental impacts. The joint report of the Kernforschungsanlage Julich (KFA), Julich, FRG and the Siberian Energy Institute (SEI), Irkutsk, USSR describes the concepts, methodological approaches, and preliminary results of the analysis of technological options and technoeconomic properties of the different types of integrated energy systems.
