Subsequently, Crayola used the {{opportunity}} to develop a new packaging strategy by emphasizing their gold medal on the front of many of their products and crayon boxes. This strategy turned out to be so successful and recognizable to their brand that they phased out nearly all of their other Crayola <b>line</b> <b>box</b> designs to adapt to the gold medal format, which appeared on their packaging for the next 50-plus years.|$|E

50|$|In 1923 the GNR {{was absorbed}} by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) {{and with it the}} East Lincolnshire Railway. The LNER carried out a variety of {{improvements}} on the line, namely the replacement of the GNR Somersult signals with the more common upper quadrant at some locations on the <b>line.</b> <b>Box</b> name boards were also changed from the black background with white lettering to the usual (and later BR specifications) white background with black lettering, although Louth South obtained an enamel sign, which remained on the box until its closure on 5 October 1970.|$|E
50|$|At this point, the GeoRSS {{collaboration}} {{has completed}} work on two primary encodings that are called GeoRSS Geography Markup Language (GML) and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS-Simple {{is a very}} lightweight format that supports basic geometries (point, <b>line,</b> <b>box,</b> polygon) and covers the typical use cases when encoding locations. GeoRSS GML is a formal Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) GML Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than GeoRSS Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than WGS84 latitude/longitude. There is also a W3C GeoRSS serialization, which is older and partly deprecated but still the most widely used.|$|E

50|$|A {{domestic}} single British {{telephone line}} installation {{will have a}} single master socket or <b>line</b> <b>box</b> in the premises, which is provided by BT or another service provider: this socket is the demarcation point between the customer-owned and maintained on-premises wiring, and the telephone network. For installations using the NTE5 <b>line</b> <b>box</b> (NTE for network termination equipment), the demarcation point is actually within the socket: {{the lower half of}} the front plate and associated wiring is the customer's, while the permanent wiring on the non-removable section behind this, remains the responsibility of the service provider. Customers are not permitted to access the wiring in a master socket without a removable lower section. Plug-in extension kits are available for customers with this type of installation. The two wires from the exchange are denoted the B leg at −48V relative to ground when the line is not in use and the A leg which is near ground potential when the line is not in use. The A leg goes to pin 5 and the B leg to pin 2 in the master socket. (Although all equipment will work with a reversed line, so a reverse wired socket is not strictly a fault.) When current is flowing on the line, the B leg voltage collapses to nearer ground and the A leg voltage moves nearer to the B leg voltage. The exact voltage drop is a function of the distance to the exchange, and the network wiring type.|$|E
50|$|In May 1848, {{the station}} became a {{junction}} when a branch line to Dunstable was opened. The London and North Western Railway replaced the first station in February 1859 by another more permanent structure located 8 chain m to the south. The new building had an imposing frontage featuring arched windows. Access to the Dunstable branch {{was controlled by}} Leighton No. 2 signal box situated {{to the north of}} the station, while the actual branch signals were controlled by the main <b>line</b> <b>box</b> to the south. In 1874, land was purchased to the south of the station alongside the Dunstable branch for the construction of goods sidings, which eventually became known as Wing Yard.|$|E
50|$|Little Prairie was {{incorporated}} as a waterworks district on 8 October 1957; within {{the span of}} a few year a rail line, natural gas pipeline, and telephone line were built along the highway from Prince George. Provincial Minister of Railways Ralph L.T. Chetwynd (who also directed the Pacific Great Eastern Railway) headed the rail line project. The rail line continued eastward to Dawson Creek which was the western-most terminus of Northern Alberta Railways. In early 1958, the first train ceremonially arrived in Little Prairie from Vancouver. Its load included pipe to symbolize natural gas development, steel railway track for {{the extension of the}} rail <b>line,</b> <b>box</b> cars for grain and lumber, and a truck representing freight hauling along the Alaska Highway. The railway station in Little Prairie was completed in 1959 and named after Chetwynd, who had died two years earlier. Soon afterwards the post office adopted this name. Chetwynd became the community's official name on 1 July 1959. In 1960 the Chetwynd Waterworks District expanded its mandate to include garbage disposal, fire protection, and street lighting. Led by its Chamber of Commerce, the community incorporated as a municipality on 25 September 1962.|$|E

50|$|Founded in 1923, Lou Mitchell's {{is known}} for handing out fresh donut holes to people waiting in <b>line,</b> <b>boxes</b> of Milk Duds to children, an orange slice and prune for breakfast, and a small cup of ice cream with each meal.

30|$|Light gray {{spots of}} Ti 3 SiC 2 were {{observed}} and are {{indicated in the}} dotted <b>line</b> <b>box</b> in Fig. 4 a, and Cu and Ti {{are present in the}} dotted <b>line</b> <b>box</b> in Fig. 4 b, d. Within the dotted <b>line</b> <b>box</b> in Fig. 4 b, the color changes from bright red to green from the matrix {{to the center of the}} bright spots, indicating that the concentration of Cu is decreasing gradually. Within the dotted <b>line</b> <b>box</b> in Fig. 4 c, the color of Ti changes from orange in interior to green in exterior. It can be inferred that the concentration of Ti 3 SiC 2 is decreasing gradually. These results suggest that the Cu phase and Ti 3 SiC 2 phase are closely bound and Cu and Ti 3 SiC 2 have high wettability [27].|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{observation}} and {{comparison of the}} areas indicated by the arrows in Fig.  4 a-c, it can be inferred that the black tadpole-like substance primarily comprises C. As shown in Fig. 4 c, the center of C is bright red, indicating that the concentration of C is high. A green circle around the bright red spots indicates that the concentration of C decreases gradually {{from the center of}} the bright spots to the exterior. As indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4 b, the color changes from bright red to green and then the final color is dark blue, moving from the matrix to the center of the bright spots. The changes in color indicate that the concentration of Cu is decreasing gradually. Such gradual change processes of the two elements verify the mutual diffusion of C and Cu, suggesting close binding between the C reinforcement phase and the Cu matrix. The content of Cu in the red dotted <b>line</b> <b>box</b> is high and stable, and the corresponding content of C is low but stable, indicating a small amount of C diffuses in Cu. Cu and C would not react to produce new substances under the conditions of the experiment. These results suggest that C partially diffuses into Cu, and Cu and C form are well bound.|$|E
