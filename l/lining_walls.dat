60|$|The partial {{civilization of}} the age of chivalry had now reached its climax, and the class which had felt its {{refining}} effects was that best able to gratify the tastes still unknown to the great mass of the ignorant and impoverished people. It was a splendid time, and the robber counts and barons of the continent, newly tamed and Christianized into knights, spent splendidly, as became magnificent cavaliers serving noble ladies. The Venetians, who seldom did merely heroic things, who turned the Crusades to their own account and made money out of the Holy Land, and whom one always fancies as having a half scorn of the noisy grandeur of chivalry, were very glad to supply the knights and ladies with the gorgeous stuffs, precious stones, and costly perfumes of the East; and they now also began to establish manufactories, and to practice the industrial arts at home. Their jewelers and workers in precious metals soon became famous throughout Europe; the glass-works of Murano rose into celebrity and importance which they have never since lost (for they still supply the world with beads); and they began to weave stuffs of gold tissue at Venice, and silks so exquisitely dyed that no cavalier or dame of perfect fashion was content with any other. Besides this they gilded leather for <b>lining</b> <b>walls,</b> wove carpets, and wrought miracles of ornament in wax,--a material that modern taste is apt to disdain,--while Venetian candles in chandeliers of Venetian glass lighted up the palaces of the whole civilized world.|$|E

50|$|Bruce Rickard {{was born}} in Roseville on 1 December 1929 to Arthur Lancelot Rickard and his wife Myfanwy. He studied at Sydney Technical College in 1947, whilst working for his uncle, Ruskin Rowe at the Sydney Ancher 1949 to 1953. His work has been said to be heavily {{influenced}} by Frank Lloyd Wright. Rickard believed {{this was due to}} the use of the same principles that Frank Lloyd Wright espoused. The main principle being space, its creation and manipulation horizontally and vertically. This was shown overlapping rooms to get more space as opposed to <b>lining</b> <b>walls</b> and creating rectangular spaces. It was not until Rickard moved to the United States in 1954 that he embraced the American architect's principles fully. Rickard died on 22 September 2010 of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E

40|$|Highlights - Investigated {{the fire}} {{performance}} of calcium silicate board lined cold-formed steel stud walls. - No integrity failure {{was observed in}} the 20 mm thick calcium silicate board lining. - Fall-off and cracking of calcium silicate boards were not observed in the fire tests. - Insulation failure occurred in calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> non-load bearing <b>walls.</b> - Compared the fire performance of calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> <b>walls</b> with gypsum plasterboard and magnesium oxide board <b>lined</b> <b>walls.</b> Abstract Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and <b>lined</b> with <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF <b>walls</b> <b>lined</b> with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard <b>lined</b> LSF <b>walls.</b> This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF <b>wall</b> <b>lined</b> with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board <b>lined</b> LSF <b>walls.</b> The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> <b>walls</b> was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard <b>lined</b> <b>walls,</b> but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board <b>lined</b> <b>walls.</b> The failure criterion of these calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> <b>walls</b> was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the diagnostic, morbid, anatomical and histopathological features of pyelocalyceal cysts with hydrotic nephritis of the kidney in a 3 -year-old boy, and discusses the pathogenesis. Calyceal cysts {{gave rise to}} a ‘large blue cystic lobulated kidney’ with microscopic changes in nephrons identifiable as ‘hydrotic nephritic glomerulosclerosis’. Pelvic and calyceal cysts were identifiable by location, number, arrangement, and morbid anatomical and microscopic features of their <b>lining</b> <b>walls.</b> Such cysts may develop due to partial or complete obliterate adhesions at the uretero-pelvic and pyelocalyceal junctions. Patent calyceo-tubulonephric junctions in such cases may give rise to hydrotic nephritis. Pyelocalyceal cystic disease with hydrotic nephritis of the kidney needs to be distinguished from megacalycosis and hydronephrosis and deserves recognition. Observations in this case may provide the basis for future classifications of cystic renal diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{improper}} {{disposal of}} industrial waste and exploitation {{of natural resources}} {{has resulted in the}} scarcity of river sand and environmental degradation, such as river erosions and pollution. This study aimed to assess the durability of mixed mortar <b>lining</b> <b>walls</b> and ceilings, containing 0 (default), 10 and 20 % of dregs-grits compounds-waste of the pulp industry-in substitution with river sand. This was done with tests that simulated both natural and artificial conditions: Direct solar incidence (testing ultraviolet radiation), attack by spraying solution (salt spray test), natural warming of the walls and ceilings incidence by indirect solar (thermal degradation) and residential fires (thermogravimetric test), in compliance with both national and/or international standards. The grout containing dregs-grits compounds showed similarity to standard (0 %) for testing thermal degradability, thermogravimetric and ultraviolet radiation, but shows significantly less durability when exposed to salty environments...|$|E

40|$|With flow, the {{acoustical}} {{effect of}} a <b>lined</b> <b>wall</b> cannot be described by a single quantity like the wall impedance. At least two quantities are required. In addition to the impedance, the unsteady tangential force exerted by the wall on the flow {{has to be taken}} into account. This force is due either to viscous effects or to the unsteady transfer of axial momentum from the flow into the <b>lined</b> <b>wall.</b> The paper describes a Stress [...] Impedance model where the two variables used are the impedance and the friction factor that links the pressure to a tangential stress at the wall. The use of a wall stress helps to better understand the mechanisms of momentum transfer between the flow and the wall in the vicinity of an acoustic treatment. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
