25|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital loss, the after-tax capital <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|E

However, the actual accounting system of GDP can only reflect the domestic economical product or income, but cannot indicate the large cost of environment pollution and ecological damage accompanying with high economical development, unabling to meet the need of sustainable development of human society. So far, there has no a green GDP accounting system issued {{in the name of}} government. In this dissertation, based on quantitative remote sensing measurement on ecological capital, the <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> of environment pollution and consummation of non-reproducible resources, the acconting system of GDP was studied and three concept models of green GDP calculation were brought forward. The models are (1) the narrow sense of green GDP calculation, which deducts the <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> of environment pollution from the traditional GDP calculation; (2) the middle sense of green GDP calculation, which deducts the <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> of environment and the cost of ecological damage from the traditionalGDPcalculation; (3) the broad sense of green GDP calculation, which deducts the <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> of environment pollution, the cost of ecological damage and the consumption of non- reproducible resources from the traditionalGDPcalculation. The narrow sense green GDP calculation was mainly calculated in this dissertation, and then, the ecological capital account and unrenewable resources account were established. With the application of geospatial techniques of observing the earth in multiple scales and environment evaluation, taking the administrative cell based on the standard 1 ： 250000 relief maps as the basal measurement cell, the evaluation models of ecological capital, the <b>loss</b> <b>value</b> of environment pollution and the consumption of unrenewable resources were established in a sight of spatial survey science, economics, environics and ecology.
