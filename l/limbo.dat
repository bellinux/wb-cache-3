5|$|Applications {{for grants}} from the Nordic Game Program, which had funded <b>Limbo</b> initial development, {{increased}} 50% {{in the second half}} of 2010, believed to be tied to the game's success. Playdead was able to buy itself back from its investors in August 2011 from the revenue made from sales of <b>Limbo.</b> Playdead's follow-up title, Inside, first released in June 2016, is visually and thematically similar to <b>Limbo,</b> and includes some elements that were cut from <b>Limbo</b> development.|$|E
5|$|Several publications, {{including}} Time, Wired and the Toronto Sun placed <b>Limbo</b> {{as one of}} the top ten {{video games}} of 2010. IGN named it the third best Xbox Live Arcade title of all time in two lists, published in 2010 and 2011, in both cases following Shadow Complex and Pac Man Championship Edition. <b>Limbo</b> was spoofed by the comedy troope Mega64 during the 2011 Game Developers Conference, and later by the CollegeHumor sister website, Dorkly.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified <b>Limbo</b> {{as an example of}} video games as an art form. <b>Limbo</b> received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that <b>Limbo</b> had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named {{as one of the top}} games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in <b>Limbo.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of <b>limbo</b> – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers.

5|$|In 2003, two {{producers}} optioned {{the rights}} to create a live-action film based on Metroid, but the rights expired.

5|$|Initial {{development}} was funded personally by Jensen and Patti along with Danish government grants, including {{funding from the}} Nordic Game Program, while large investors were sought later in the development cycle.

5|$|Maids' representatives {{said that}} when the waiver was announced, the {{guidelines}} were unclear and had no implementation date. Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving them in <b>limbo.</b> They protested the uncertainty, demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK$4,000. Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers' contracts, stoking fears of mass terminations.

Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in <b>limbo.</b> Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E

5000|$|Working {{within the}} [...] "problems of abstraction" [...] the artist often takes up a class-conscious {{cultural}} criticism through {{the genre of}} the funerary as well as processes derived from psychic automatism.

[...] He was, however, critical of the puzzle-based levels in the sewers, {{the ease with which}} the player can die, and the final section of the game, writing [...] "These flaws are the difference between <b>Limbos</b> transcendent excellence and Deadlights mere greatness." ...|$|R
