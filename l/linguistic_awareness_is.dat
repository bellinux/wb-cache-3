40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{linguistic}} awareness of children at {{the first and second}} grade of elementary school in both reading methods, i. e. the analytic-synthetic and the genetic method of reading. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the critical analysis of the terms "linguistic awareness" and "linguistic sense" is done and further the approaches and traditions used abroad are compared to actual situation in the Czech Republic. In the analytic part of the thesis, the research project focused on the comparison of two tests of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> developed. The first method is the traditional Linguistic Sense Examination (Žlab, 1992), used not only for the diagnosing of the specific learning disorders, but also for diagnosing of bilingual children, children from minority groups and children with hearing or mental disabilities. The second method is the new Linguistic Awareness Test (Kucharská, Šmejkalová, under the preparation) prepared in the cooperation with Department of Czech Language and the Department of psychology PedF UK.

40|$|The present thesis {{comprises}} two {{case studies}} of two multilingual pupils in second-ary school, focusing {{on the relationship between}} knowledge, language and learning through a comparison of literacy activities in the two school subjects, Textile Crafts and Social Studies. The theoretical framework is sociocultural and the research methods include ob-servations, interviews and artifact analysis of the literacy practices in the two sub-jects as well as analyses of spoken and written texts. The latter were performed using multimodal and systemic functional linguistics analyses. The results reveal that both school subjects can be described as mono-linguistic, and that the teachers teach mono- and multilingual pupils in the same way. Also, the two focus students, David and Sarah, were offered various multimodal texts in each of the two school subjects. However, David deflects many of the teachers’ text of-fers in the form of writing in both the literacy practices in both subjects, avoiding having to expose himself to situations in which he is forced to read or write. Sarah, on the other hand, used writing for different purposes and in different ways. Also, the semiotic resources she used were often more advanced and more complex com-pared to those used by David. Another important finding was that the teachers seemed to "tune in" with the students’, thus enhancing their own choices as to avoid-ing or using the language offered through different semiotic resources. A pedagogical implication of the study concerns how teachers and students are aware of students’ multilingualism and how this <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> used in the classroom. This calls for more research on how to create teacher awareness about multilingual students’ need to develop linguistic competence in all school subjects in different languages. Another pedagogical implication is the importance of selecting texts that enable high support in relation {{to the nature of the}} task and its objectives, i. e. how texts function in relation to the task and what they afford...|$|E

40|$|Theories {{relating}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> {{to reading}} suggest that {{different types of}} <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> required for different reading skills. In this paper we investigated the relation between children's awareness of different levels of language ambiguity in riddles and their comprehension and accuracy skills. In Experiment 1, 29 8 - 11 year-olds heard riddles requiring relatively high levels of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness.</b> Riddle recall <b>was</b> significantly related to reading comprehension skill after reading accuracy and age were partialled out.

40|$|Recently {{many new}} German bible {{translations}} have appeared. The article first presents {{a comparison of}} paragraphs from ten different translations, with examples taken from the New Testament. This shows some basic trends. On the one hand, the objective of bible translation is Christian education, edification and worship usage. On the other hand, some translations focus on the cultural information, easy readability and inclusive language. Such orientation accepts purposeful adaptation and thus modifies the original text. And {{there are a few}} translations that constitute the product of an individual interpretation of the text, and its presentation in a literary form. The discussion of these translation trends is complemented by a critique of the prominent focus on the language rather than on the message, and the question of a text's truth and a translator's <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> raised. The traditional translation criticism distinguishing between literal and target-oriented translation, and even cultural adaptation, is integrated here by a discussion of the procedural, functional, objectivistic and ethical implications of the new bible translations. One feature of all recent projects of bible translation seems to be a pedagogical concern. Authors think that they need to guide readers in their interpretation, because those may be unable to understand the very old, strange and often opaque text; or they might misunderstand it and thus miss the true message; or they should learn something about the historic culture; and last but not least, traditional patriarchal attitudes promoted by Christianity should be overcome with a new text. The idea is that people's thinking can be directed by language. Thus the question is raised, whether a translation should also be an interpretation. In a critical view of the interpretive translation, this article presents the hermeneutic approach to translation. This implies a well-informed openness as an attitude towards the original message, rather than a method. The focus is neither on language structure nor on the addressees, but on the text's message. This includes the problem of understanding a written text, what is never a matter of fact. The text's theological exegesis is a prerequisite for the translation, but the value of that translation is not only based on that. Translation aims at a faithful representation of the message and opens the direction of a text, but the individual interpretation is always done by the readers themselves. When the translator as a reader identifies himself with the message, s/he will cognitively produce formulations apt to give resonance to this message. The translator becomes a co-author of that text, and just as for the original author, one will never totally govern the readers' understanding. The translator's voice will be more convincing, when only one person is responsible for the text production, different from the team works in various official projects of bible translation. Even if the bible as such is a composition of many different books and pieces of texts, these manifold voices may be better noted by one translator alone, rather than by many contributors, each of whom as a specialist only translates one book. Finally, the stylistic shape of the target text is decisive. The bible translator should have an excellent knowledge of the target language, in order to present various nuances. Translating is not an information about an original text, it represents that original message in another language...|$|E

40|$|Imitations are {{sophisticated}} performances displaying regular patterns. The {{study of}} imitation allows linguiSts to understand speakers' perceptions of sociolinguistic variation. In this dissertation, I analyze imitations of non-native accents {{in order to}} answer two questions: what can imitation reveal about perception, and how are folk linguistic artifacts (Preston 1996) involved in imitation? These questions are approached from the framework offolk <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> (Preston 1996). By redefining the concept of salience according to the modes of folk <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness,</b> I <b>am</b> able to more precisely consider how imitation reflects salience. I address both of these questions by eliciting imitations from speakers in which folk artifacts are present. For my investigation, twenty speakers read a short passage in English. Ten were non-native speakers of American English (NNAE) and ten were native speakers of American English (AE). The AE speakers were recorded reading the passage in their regular voice and with two types of imitated accents: free imitations, which were spontaneously produced, and modeled imitations, which were produced directly after hearing the NNAE speakers. Free imitations revealed folk linguistic artifacts, while modeled imitations were more reflective of the immediate target. Participants listened to the authentic and imitated accents {{and were asked to}} determine the accent and authenticity of each speaker. I found that there was not {{a significant difference in the}} pitch and vowels between free and modeled AE imitations, which indicated that these aspects of imitations are largely based on folk linguistic artifacts. Listeners were able to determine which voices were authentic and which were imitated. Listeners were also able to identify the speakers' accents, perhaps aided by the folk artifact status of these particular accents. Listeners were better at identifying the accents of free imitations than modeled imitations, which suggested that listeners prefer imitations that are solely based on folk artifacts. Overall, I found that imitation is a valuable tool for the analysis of speech perception. The modes of folk <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> useful in interpreting imitations and understanding salience. This research shows that folk linguistic artifacts are the foundation of imitations and an important tool in perceptual categorization...|$|R

40|$|In the didactics of the Slovenian {{language}} {{as the first}} language the term language <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> related primarily to the identity function of standard {{language as}} the most important element of the national and cultural awareness, while the conception of language awareness, based on the functional linguistics, has been put forward only in the last decade.

In attempt to find the answer, first main features of both the language and <b>linguistic</b> cultural <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> presented: their levels, components and emphasized language functions. It is evident that a person’s linguistic activity and his/her linguistic identification are inseparable. Because of this, the development of language and cultural awareness in the context of two models of first language teaching is discussed later on.

30|$|Long (1991) defines FonM {{instruction}} as {{an approach}} to language teaching that emphasizes implicit language learning where learners’ focus of attention is on meaning. According to Celce-Murcia, Dörnyei, and Thurrell (1997), in a meaning focused approach, “learners are usually not specifically taught the strategies, maxims and organizational principles that govern communicative language use but are expected to work these out for themselves through extensive task engagement” (p. 141). Krashen (1981) claims that focus on meaning is the key factor for successful second language acquisition. In FonM approach, learners learn a second language best when they experience it {{as a means of}} communication and that incidental and implicit learning is sufficient for language acquisition. Therefore, explicit attention to <b>linguistic</b> items and <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> not required for successful language acquisition. This approach, hence, stresses on providing opportunities for learners to experience rich input (Norris & Ortega, 2000).|$|R

40|$|In a {{longitudinal}} study, {{we looked at}} the link between children's understanding of a morphemically-based orthographic rule and their awareness of morphemic distinctions. The orthographic rule in question was the use of the apostrophe to denote possession in English. Early on in the study, we gave the children phonological, semantic/syntactic and morpho-syntactic awareness tasks, and later we gave them a spelling task in which they had to write words which were either genitives (e. g., 'boy's') or nominative or accusative plurals (e. g., 'boys'). Eight- to 10 -year-old children found this task difficult, but their performance improved to some extent with age. The morpho-syntactic, but not the phonological or semantic/syntactic, awareness tasks predicted how well the children placed apostrophes in genitive words and omitted them from plural words. We conclude that different forms of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> affect different aspects of reading and spelling.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how professional development conditions, events, and activities {{relate to the}} process of teachers becoming linguistically aware. Through an analysis of 18 transcribed individual and group interviews, I show how changes in beliefs about language, as well as the application of these changes to teachers' pedagogies take place among a sample of 14 teachers. I analyze these findings as an outcome of these teachers' professional development and in relation to models of effective professional development derived from the fields of Multicultural Education, Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), Intercultural Communication, and Sociolinguistics. I also propose a new model, the Process of <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Awareness</b> and Application Model (PLAA Model, Strickling, 2012), that more accurately evaluates how changes take place as the teachers in this study become more linguistically aware. Changes in beliefs about language involve a cycle of five phases: confronting new linguistic information, questioning linguistic information and previously held beliefs, integrating new linguistic information within contexts of social engagement, evaluating the relational, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the experience, and modifying beliefs about language within the specific context of the experience. The PLAA Model also shows how a nuanced secondary cycle can occur where the process of questioning, integrating, and evaluating inform each other in a repeating cycle of increasing <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> before the final phase of modifying beliefs takes place. The cycle results in experiential linguistic knowledge and becomes the paradigm for new questioning. Within the secondary cycle, the teachers in this study show that they either gain a more linguistically aware knowledge from their integrating experience or within some contexts, reinscribe an aspect of their previously held standard language beliefs and gain a <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> during the same experience.
