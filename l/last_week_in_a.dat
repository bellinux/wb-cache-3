Look at that young Frenchman who went up <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> balloon. It was blowing a gale of wind; but because he was {{announced}} to go he insisted on starting.

The Tigers gave up nearly 500 yards <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss to Georgia and Mississippi State had some early success with a two-quarterback system. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Prescott has been terrific in Russell's place, providing {{much more of a}} running threat. On the team's first offensive drive, he rewarded Mullen's confidence with a 28-yard touchdown run to pull the Bulldogs to 7-6. Russell entered the game early in the second quarter and also had immediate success, throwing a 20-yard touchdown to Lewis to pull Mississippi State to 21-16 in the second quarter. The Bulldogs took a 23-21 lead on Russell's 59-yard touchdown pass to De'Runnya Wilson, but LSU responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Mettenberger to Beckham to take a 28-23 lead into halftime. Russell's second touchdown pass was the 39th of his career, which set a Mississippi State record. He finished 7 of 11 for 146 yards passing.|$|E
5000|$|Noblesse Oblige was {{received}} with favourable reviews. [...] Unabashedly snobbish and devastatingly witty, Miss Mitford achieved enormous success and popularity {{as one of}} Britain's most piercing observers of social manners... Indeed, one of Miss Mitford's pet concerns entered the history of obscure literary debates when, in 1955, she published perhaps her most famous essay on upper-class and non-upper-class forms of speech. The essay sparked such a controversy in Britain, with responses from many major literary figures, that Miss Mitford was compelled a year later to bring out a thin book, [...] "Noblesse Oblige," [...] with her disquisition on the subject as its centerpiece. Her argument, a set-piece even today among literary parlor games, was that the more elegant euphemism used for any word is usually the non-upper-class thing to say—or, in Miss Mitford's words, simply non-U. Thus: It is very non-U to say [...] "dentures"; [...] "false teeth" [...] will do. Ill is non-U; sick is U. The non-U person resides at his home. The U person lives in his house. And so forth. The New York Times [...] In these days of penurious peers and vanishing stately homes, how can one tell whether an Englishman is a genuine member of the Upper Class? <b>Last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slim anthology of aristocratic manners edited by aristocratic Novelist Nancy Mitford (Noblesse Oblige; Hamish Hamilton), England got an answer that has managed to stir up everyone from Novelist Graham Greene to Actor John Loder.
