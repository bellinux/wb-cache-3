50|$|Since {{the initial}} launch, Adobe has {{released}} two additional feature-bearing updates. The first, version 14.1, was launched on 9 September 2013. The major features in this version were Adobe Generator, a Node.js-based platform for creating plug-ins for Photoshop. Photoshop 14.1 shipped with two plug-ins, one to automatically generate image assets {{based on an}} extension in the <b>layer</b> <b>name,</b> and another to automatically generate assets for Adobe Edge Reflow.|$|E
30|$|Legend: This {{is needed}} in order to clarify the symbols used to {{represent}} features on the map. Legend consists of examples of the symbols on the map with labels containing explanatory text. When you use a single symbol for the features in a layer, the layer is labeled with the <b>layer</b> <b>name</b> in the legend. User can open attribute for the layer or show properties, etc. (Figure  5).|$|E
30|$|We {{have more}} than 5800 pre-processed images to learn and have begun {{fine-tuning}} with the parameters learnt from 1, 000, 000 image-net images. If we provide the weights argument to the Caffe train command, the previously learned weights melt into our model, and the layers will match by name. In other words, a new data classifier will be created based on previously learned models. We changed the last layer’s name of the existing CaffeNet model from fc 8 to fc 8 _television, fc 8 _ refrigerator, and so on. Since there is no <b>layer</b> <b>name</b> in the existing bvlc_reference_ caffenet layer, this layer starts learning with random weights. We have created new models for all the eight categories of home appliances using fine-tuning. The results {{are discussed in the}} following section.|$|E

5000|$|The {{terminal}} emulator Eterm has an interface <b>layer</b> <b>named</b> Escreen for interoperating with the terminal multiplexers GNU Screen or Twin. This allows Eterm to support multiple sub-shell sessions {{within a single}} window. This feature works similarly to the [...] "tabbed" [...] sessions offered by {{terminal emulator}}s such as Konsole or GNOME Terminal. However, being an interface to existing software, Escreen {{has the advantage of}} providing additional capabilities like multiple regions per display, detach/reattach capability, seamless remote session support, firewall support, and more.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{multitude}} of overlay network projects are emerging today providing the Internet with advanced features its architecture did not naturally support (routing, naming, addressing, mobility and security). Numerous complex scenarios faced today such as mobile devices, multi-homing equipments and middleboxes were not envisioned on TCP/IP conception and are already posing {{a set of}} convergence challenges. Our objective is to investigate and compare several examples of these advanced network layers deployed on the Internet and propose a flat <b>layered</b> <b>naming</b> architecture for the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{classical}} communication {{networks are}} modeled as a protocols stack, often {{referring to the}} ISO/OSI stack. Each protocol is belonging to a certain layer, and it is independent from the other layers. In the modern telecommunication networks, especially for the wireless communication, the protocol division in layers can be a strong limitation to the network optimization. For this reason future standards foresee an interaction between <b>layers,</b> <b>named</b> cross-layer design. This {{is one of the}} first step toward the 4 G systems. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{developed}} {{system was}} designed in three <b>layers</b> <b>named</b> respectively: vision, strategy and control. On this paper we {{will focus on}} vision and control layers because these have more technical features to explore. The main characteristics of the vision layer are the objects recognition based on color {{and the use of}} camshift algorithm to track objects. On the other hand, the characteristics of the control layer are the use of a ZigBee protocol-based communication device to send commands to the robots and the use of a non-linear controller to move them...|$|R

The product line continued with the N900, with phone capabilities. The user interface and application framework <b>layer,</b> <b>named</b> Hildon, {{was an early}} instance of a software platform for generic computing in a tablet device intended for internet consumption. But Nokia didn't commit to it as their only platform for their future mobile devices and the project competed against other in-house platforms and later replaced it with the Series 60.|$|R
50|$|Character Animator imports layered Photoshop & Illustrator {{documents}} into puppets {{which have}} behaviors applied to them. The puppets are then placed into a scene, {{which can be}} viewed in the Scene panel and Timeline panel. Rigging is {{set up in the}} Puppet panel, though basic rigging is fully automatic based on specific <b>layer</b> <b>names</b> like Right Eyebrow and Smile. Properties of selected elements can be examined and changed in the Properties panel, including behavior parameters. Live inputs include a webcam (for face-tracking), microphone (for live lip sync), keyboard (for triggering layers to hide/show), and mouse (for warping specific handles).|$|R
50|$|The bones {{include two}} partial skulls, four jaws, a legbone, around two hundred teeth {{and several other}} parts. The two specimens, Omo I and Omo II, differ in {{morphological}} traits. The Omo II fossils indicate more archaic traits. Studies of the postcranial remains of Omo I indicate an overall modern human morphology with some primitive features. The fossils were found in a layer of tuff, between a lower, older geologic <b>layer</b> <b>named</b> Member I and a higher, newer layer dubbed Member III. The Omo I and Omo II hominin fossils were taken from similar stratigraphic levels over Member I.|$|R
50|$|It is a woody fruit, elliptic, green colored, {{measuring}} from 3 to 4 cm {{long and}} from 2,4 to 2,8 cm broad.

The seeds are covered by an aromatic reddish fleshy <b>layer</b> <b>named</b> sarcotesta. The moister content of fresh seeds is around 35,3%. 1’000 seeds weight from 108 to 125 grams and 1 kilogram can have from 8’000 to 9’260 seeds.|$|R
50|$|The graphic {{system has}} a <b>layer</b> <b>named</b> Presentation Manager that manages windows, fonts, and icons. This {{is similar in}} {{functionality}} to a non-networked version of X11 or the Windows GDI. On top of this lies the Workplace Shell (WPS) introduced in OS/2 2.0. WPS is an object-oriented shell allowing the user to perform traditional computing tasks such as accessing files, printers, launching legacy programs, and advanced object oriented tasks using built-in and third-party application objects that extended the shell in an integrated fashion not available on any other mainstream operating system. WPS follows IBM's Common User Access user interface standards.|$|R
50|$|The {{nematodes}} are whitish in colour, cylindrical, {{and with}} fine longitudinal striations throughout the body. The body covering is a proteinaceous <b>layer</b> <b>named</b> cuticle. The anterior end is the mouth with distinct lips, and the anus opens towards the posterior. They are diecious with marked sexual dimorphism. Males are shorter and smaller, with straight blunt tails, while females are bigger and longer, with curved tails. They all exhibit direct lifecycles. They cause nodular typhlitis, diarrhoea, emaciation, and death. H. gallinarum {{is the most}} well-known species, and is most important as it transmits the protozoan parasite, Histomonas meleagridis in birds.|$|R

2500|$|The ammolite {{deposits}} are stratified {{into several}} layers: the shallowest of these <b>layers,</b> <b>named</b> the [...] "K Zone", lies some 15meters {{below the surface}} and extends 30meters down. The ammolite within this layer is covered by siderite concretions and is usually cracked—this is the crush material. It {{is the most common}} and (generally speaking) the least valuable of ammolite. Beginning twenty meters below the crush material is the [...] "Blue Zone"; ammolite from this zone, which extends 65meters, is usually compressed with a thin layer of pyrite rather than siderite concretions. This is the sheet material; due to its depth it is rarely mined. It is also much less fractured, and therefore the more valuable type of ammolite.|$|R
30|$|These levels {{should not}} be taken as hard and well-delineated layers, but more as useful props to capture the {{shifting}} organization of modern large-scale distributed systems. The infrastructure level seeks to cover the communication <b>layer</b> (<b>naming,</b> multicast), fundamental mechanisms (remote invocation, distributed events), and base services (service discovery, directory, membership) of a distributed system. By distributed data, we mean the strategies used to distribute data in a large-scale system while accounting for performance and scalability. Finally, Programming Frameworks aim to provide generic programmatic structures that guide developers when realizing a broad range of applications. Frameworks usually embody patterns, guidelines, and rules into a predefined but flexible architecture that developers can extend and modify to fit their needs.|$|R
