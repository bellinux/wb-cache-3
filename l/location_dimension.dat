40|$|Public {{expenditure}} in the UK has a <b>location</b> <b>dimension</b> {{with respect}} to the devolved arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is no <b>location</b> <b>dimension</b> to the allocation of public expenditure to the regions of England. Nevertheless, whether planned or not, public expenditure impacts on the regions through the provision of services and associated employment and income generation. This paper examines the methodological issues in assigning public expenditure to countries and regions, and reviews existing and past patterns of public expenditure in English regions. It then considers the relevance of this analysis to policy options for introducing an explicit regional dimension to the public expenditure allocation mechanism in England. Paradoxically, English regional devolution is potentially more radical in its implications, in terms of rupturing existing allocative mechanisms that lead to flows of expenditure, than devolution in the territories (where it can be interpreted as putting democratic caps on pre-existing bureaucratic bodies) ...|$|E
40|$|The average insurer {{typically}} utilizes {{some form}} of territory ratemaking in its algorithm; thus. in constructing a GLM. {{one of the major}} issues revolves around how to reflect location in the statistical solution. The problem arises because there are too many territory categories todirectly include in the statistical model. This issue can be resolved by altering the perception of the <b>location</b> <b>dimension</b> from a categorical rating variable to a continuous one. This paper presents an alternative approach to incorporating the <b>location</b> <b>dimension</b> i the GLM analysis of the rating algorithm. The procedure develops the indicated relativities and boundaries in a statistical multidimensional framework thus removing the distributional effects of other rating variables and measuring the geographic risk alone. Furthermore, the territory procedure is based on the principle of locality, i. e., the expected loss experience atlocation L is similar to the loss experience around L. The indicated relativities of each geographic unit are determined by modeling polynomial functions of latitude and longitude in the GLM statistical framework. By expressing the indication in terms of a polynomial the analyst can include location in the statistical model without having to worry about oo man), additional parameters. 24...|$|E

Comparing four unrelated languages, we demonstrate that the two hands are recruited to encode various relationship types in {{sign language}} lexicons. We develop the general principle that inherently "plural" concepts are straightforwardly mapped onto our paired human hands, resulting in systematic use of the two hands across sign languages. In our analysis, "plurality" subsumes four primary relationship types – interaction, <b>location,</b> <b>dimension,</b> and composition – and we predict that signs with meanings that encompass these relationships – such as 'meet', 'empty', 'large', or 'machine' – will preferentially be twohanded in any sign language...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of the Tyrrhenian–Apennines system has been characterized by a complex distribution of major tectonic events, such as opening of basins, migration and distortion of orogenic belts, retreat of trench zones, stopping of consuming processes and starting of new subductions.

These nanowires or nanotubes have also been utilized as potential building blocks for functional nanodevices. The key for the integration of those nanowire or nanotube based devices is to assemble these one dimensional nanomaterials to specific locations using techniques that are highly controllable and scalable. Ideally such techniques should enable assembly of highly uniform nanowire/nanotube arrays with precise control of density, <b>location,</b> <b>dimension</b> or even material type of nanowire/nanotube. Numerous assembly techniques are being developed that can quickly align and assemble large quantities of one type or multiple types of nanowires through parallel processes, including flow-assisted alignment, Langmuir-Blodgett assembly, bubble-blown technique, electric/magnetic- field directed assembly, contact/roll printing, knocking-down, etc.. With these assembling techniques, applications of nanowire/nanotube based devices such as flexible electronics and sensors have been demonstrated. This paper delivers an overall review of directed nanowire assembling approaches and analyzes advantages and limitations of each method. The future research directions have also been discussed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{integrates}} McCarthy’s REA (Resources-Events-Agents) {{model and}} the closely related REAL (Resources Events Agents Locations) model with general capabilities and requirements of data warehouses. REA/REAL contribute a theory for cap-turing information about events and a focus on control relationships. Data warehouses bring time-period information and a focus on information facilitating the creation of value. Using aspects from both camps, a hybrid schema is developed called REAL-D, REAL for Data warehouses. Existing data warehouse approaches lack theory, while REA/REAL are theory based. Unique demands on data warehouses, however, make additional requirements on REA/REAL, including (1) addition of time period as another dimension {{in order to allow}} rollups from hour to day to week to month to year, (2) addition of location to facilitate rollups from office to city to district, (3) change from a pure <b>location</b> <b>dimension</b> to a nonhomogeneous dimension that allows rollup from person to office, and (4) change of relationships of agents from one of control to a marketing-oriented one.

40|$|Effective {{diagnostics}} {{with ground}} penetrating radar (GPR) {{is strongly dependent on}} the amount and quality of available data {{as well as on the}} efficiency of the adopted imaging procedure. In this frame, the aim of the present work is to investigate the capability of a typical GPR system placed at a ground interface to derive three-dimensional (3 D) information on the features of buried dielectric targets (<b>location,</b> <b>dimension,</b> and shape). The scatterers can have size comparable to the resolution limits and can be placed in the shallow subsurface in the antenna near field. Referring to canonical multimonostatic configurations, the forward scattering problem is analyzed first, obtaining a variety of synthetic GPR traces and radargrams by means of a customized implementation of an electromagnetic CAD tool. By employing these numerical data, a full 3 D frequency-domain microwave tomographic approach, specifically designed for the inversion problem at hand, is applied to tackle the imaging process. The method is tested here by considering various scatterers, with different shapes and dielectric contrasts. The selected tomographic results i...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{acquired}} swath-bathymetry {{data and}} high-resolution seismic reflection profiles offshore Adra (Almería, Spain) reveal the surficial {{expression of a}} NW–SE trending 20 km-long fault, which we termed the Adra Fault. Seismic imaging across the structure depicts a sub-vertical fault reaching the seafloor surface and slightly dipping to the NE showing an along-axis structural variability. Our new data suggest normal displacement of the uppermost units with probably a lateral component. Radiocarbon dating of a gravity core located in the area indicates that seafloor sediments are of Holocene age, suggesting present-day tectonic activity. The NE Alboran Sea area is characterized by significant low-magnitude earthquakes and by historical records of moderate magnitude, such as the Mw = 6. 1 1910 Adra Earthquake. The <b>location,</b> <b>dimension</b> and kinematics of the Adra Fault agree with the fault solution and magnitude of the 1910 Adra Earthquake, whose moment tensor analysis indicates normal-dextral motion.
