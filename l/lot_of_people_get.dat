5000|$|... "On My Own" [...] {{was written}} by Yasmin, Ian Greenidge and its {{producer}} Andre Williams, {{who goes by the}} stage name of Shy FX. Yasmin's DJ'ing experience enriched her with A&R knowledge which allowed her to choose and meet up with Shy FX to produce [...] "On My Own". She knew Shy FX from her time as a DJ and was a fan of his work, and later phoned him for a studio session. Speaking to Alex Andrews of Gigwise, Yasmin elaborated on her love for Shy FX's production style, [...] "I don't have to say much to him, he just knows exactly what to do."

Writing about the independence themes of the song, Semper Azeez-Harris of Blues & Soul mentioned that Yasmin's path was not followed by the formulaic [...] "I {{always wanted to be a}} singer" [...] mould, adding, [...] "Whilst a love for music is the prerequisite for wanting to be a singer the fact that she chose the male dominated world of DJ'ing initially as a way to satiate that love of music, epitomises her independence streak." [...] Speaking to Azeez-Harris, Yasmin explained how she was constantly patronised when DJ-ing, [...] "In a lot of scenarios I have been at gigs where people have not heard me before but once I get on the decks people cannot tell me that I do not deserve to be on there." [...] She was also inspired by music of the 1990s during the song's development, naming Massive Attack, Madonna and All Saints as some of the acts which influenced the track. In the Daily Record report, Yasmin mentioned, [...] "1990s was a really cool time, with a lot of mood and vibe in the music, recently a lot music is very samey, it's nice to be able to go back to a mood and groove." [...] She wanted [...] "On My Own" [...] to be [...] "fresh but familiar, new school but old school." [...] Her experience as a DJ in Glasgow is manifested in the song's lyrics.

[...] Speaking to Live Magazine, Yasmin said that [...] "On My Own" [...] is about being brave, taking risks, looking after yourself and making things happen for yourself.

My friend's mum always used to stay stuff to us, because my friend is a stylist and I was doing what I was doing so we would message each other and be like oh my god I'm just sitting for lunch on my own - how embarrassing but my friend's mum would say it takes a very strong person to sit in a restaurant on their own."
