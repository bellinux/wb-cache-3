40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} visual {{resolution}} of multiple cell and vascular <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>layers</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 in the cat retina using MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T 2 - and diffusion-weighted MRI at 4. 7 Tesla was performed. Layer-specific thickness, T 2, spin density, apparent diffusion coefficient perpendicular (ADC(perpendicular)) and parallel (ADC(parallel)) to the retinal surface were tabulated. T 1 -weighted MRI was acquired {{before and after}} intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA and subtraction images were obtained. Histology was performed for validation. RESULTS: Three distinct <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>layers</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 were observed. The inner strip nearest to the vitreous (exhibiting large T 2, ADC, spin density with Gd-DTPA enhancement) overlapped the ganglion cell layer, bipolar cell layer, and the embedded retinal vascular layer. The middle strip (exhibiting small T 2, ADC, spin density without Gd-DTPA enhancement) overlapped the photoreceptor cell layer and {{the inner and outer}} segments. The outer strip (exhibiting large T 2, ADC, spin density with Gd-DTPA enhancement) overlapped the tapetum and choroidal vascular <b>layer.</b> T <b>2,</b> spin density, ADC(perpendicular) and ADC(parallel) of different <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>layers</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 were tabulated. The inner strip was slightly thicker than the other two strips. The total thickness, including neural and nonneural retina, was 358 +/- 13 microm (N = 6) by MRI and 319 +/- 77 microm (N = 5) by histology.

25|$|A {{reference}} {{simulation software}} implementation, {{written in the}} C language and later known as ISO 11172-5, was developed (in 1991–1996) {{by the members of}} the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files (Layer 1, <b>Layer</b> <b>2,</b> Layer 3). It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994. It was approved as a draft technical report (DTR/DIS) in November 1994, finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998. The reference software in C language was later published as a freely available ISO standard. Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding (DSP based) of compressed audio. Some other real time implementation of MPEG Audio encoders and decoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting (radio DAB, television DVB) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes.|$|E
500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression.

In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard).
