Intrinsic and extrinsic aging make out the two components of skin aging and they differ on the macromolecular level while sharing specific molecular characteristics which include elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) while collagen synthesis decreases. The skin functions as a protective barrier against the harsh environment and is essential for regulating body temperature. The stratum corneum (SC) is responsible for the main resistance to the penetration of most compounds; nevertheless the skin represents as an appropriate target for delivery. The target site for anti-aging treatment includes the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. Calendula oil and <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> was utilised as the cosmeceutical actives as they can be classified as a mixed category of compounds/products that lie between cosmetics and drugs. Both show excellent properties which can prove valuable during anti-aging treatment, whether it is due to the scavenging of ROS (calendula oil), moisturising effects (calendula oil and <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate)</b> or the improvement of the skin turnover rate (<b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate).</b> The Pheroid™ delivery system can enhance the absorption of a selection of active ingredients. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the Pheroid™ delivery system will enhance the flux and/or delivery of the named actives to the target site by performing Franz cell diffusion studies over an 8 h period, followed by tape stripping experiments. The Pheroid™ results of the actives were compared to the results obtained when 1 00 % calendula oil was applied and the <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. In the case of calendula oil only a qualitative gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method could be employed. No calendula oil was observed to permeate through the skin, but linoleic acid (marker compound) was present in the epidermis and dermis layers. Components in the Pheroid™ delivery system hampered the results as the marker compound identified is a fundamental component of the Pheroid™, making it difficult to determine whether or not the Pheroid™ delivery system enhanced calendula oil's penetration. The aqueous solubility and log D partition coefficient of <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> was determined. Inspection of the log D value of - 1. 35 indicated that the compound is unfavourable to penetrate the skin, whereas the aqueous solubility of 16. 63 mg/ml in PBS at a temperature of 32 º C indicated favourable penetration. During the Franz cell diffusion and tape stripping studies it was determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) that carnitine may be inherent to human skin. Pheroid™ enhanced the flux (average of 0. 0361 µg/cm 2. h, median of 0. 0393 µg/cm 2. h) of the <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> when compared to PBS (average of 0. 0180 µg/cm 2. h, median of 0. 0142 µg/cm 2. h) for the time interval of 2 - 8 h. The PBS was more effective in delivering the active to the target site (0. 270 µg/ml in the epidermis and 2. 403 µg/ml in the dermis) than Pheroid™ (0. 111 µg/ml and 1. 641 µg/ml in the epidermis and dermis respectively). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed the entrapment of <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> in the Pheroid™ vesicle, while in the case of calendula oil it was impossible to differentiate between the oil and the Pheroid™ components.

40|$|Background: The {{two types}} of skin aging (intrinsic and extrinsic) share {{important}} molecular features, while having distinct differences on the macromolecular level: both lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species, enhanced matrix metalloproteinase expression and decreased pro-collagen synthesis. <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> {{has been reported to}} have anti-aging effects. Aim and Methods: The delivery as well as the transport of L-carnitine to the target sites, i. e. stratum corneum and epidermis-dermis of female abdominal skin, with and without the use of PheroidTM as delivery system, was investigated during this study by use of Franz diffusion cells and analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The presence of endogenous L-carnitine in human skin was also investigated. Results and Conclusion: The PheroidTM delivery system enhanced the diffusion of L-carnitine through the skin, although the PBS showed a higher concentration of the active in the skin layers. This could be that PheroidTM being more lipophilic than PBS improved the diffusion of L-carnitine through the skin layers, consequently leading to a lesser amount of L-carnitine delivered to the target site, i. e. the epidermis-dermis.

Total carbohydrate and fat oxidation during 90 min steady state cycling were not different between 0 or 4 wk within LCLT or P trials (mean ± standard deviation: carbohydrate oxidation P 0 99 ± 36, P 4 W 111 ± 27, LCLT 0 107 ± 33, LCLT 4 W 112 ± 32 g, respectively; fat oxidation P 0 99 ± 28, P 4 W 92 ± 21, LCLT 0 94 ± 18, LCLT 4 W 90 ± 22 g, respectively). Subsequent 20 km time trial duration was shorter after P (P 0 31 : 29 ± 3 : 50, P 4 W 29 : 55 ± 2 : 58 min:s, P < 0. 01), with {{no significant change}} over LCLT (LCLT 031 : 46 ± 4 : 06, LCLT 4 W 31. 19 ± 4. 08 min:s).

40|$|L- Carnitine is a vitamin like {{compound}} synthesised endogenously {{from the}} {{essential amino acids}} methionine and lysine and plays {{an essential role in}} the metabolism of fatty acids. Beta-oxidation, the major process by which long chain fatty acids are oxidised in mitochondria, depends on carnitine. In theory, increased carnitine availability could increase the ability to transport long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria and thus increase their oxidation. Recent work has however shown that it is unlikely that carnitine supplementation will increase fat oxidation and may instead promote carbohydrate metabolism. Researched elements have included the role carnitine may play in muscle glycogen storage, carnitine as a potential preventative mechanism for clinical populations at risk from metabolic disorders and “insulin like” effects observed in carnitine trials. This study examined the effects of 14 days <b>L-Carnitine</b> <b>L-Tartrate</b> (LC) supplementation on blood glucose and insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test and submaximal exercise. Sixteen male participants were recruited and assigned to two groups (lean (n= 8) and overweight/obese (n= 8)). After completing a first visit for a submaximal predictive exercise test, participants attended on three further occasions, in the morning after an overnight fast, for fasting blood samples and 2 hr OGTT tests followed by an exercise bout (20 min at 40...|$|E
40|$|Twenty non-vegetarian active {{males were}} pair-matched and {{randomly}} assigned to receive 2 g <b>L-Carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> (LC). d- 1 or placebo for 2 weeks. Subjects exercised for 90 min at 70 % O 2 max following 2 days of a prescribed diet (mean ± SD: 13. 6 ± 1. 6 MJ, 57 % carbohydrate, 15 % protein, 26 % fat, 2 % alcohol) before and after supplementation. Results indicated no change in carbohydrate oxidation, nitrogen excretion, branched-chain amino acid oxidation, or plasma urea during exercise between {{the beginning and end}} of supplementation in either group. Following 2 weeks LC supplementation the plasma ammonia response to exercise tended to be suppressed (0 vs. 2 wk at 60 min exercise: 97 ± 26 vs. 80 ± 9; and 90 min exercise: 116 ± 47 vs. 87 ± 25 µmol. L- 1), with no change in the placebo group. The data indicate that 2 weeks of LC supplementation does not affect fat, carbohydrate and protein contribution to metabolism during prolonged moderate intensity cycling exercise. However, the tendency towards suppressed ammonia accumulation indicates that oral LC supplementation may have the potential to reduce the metabolic stress of exercise or alter ammonia production/removal which warrants further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 15 d of supplementation with <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> (LC) on {{metabolic}} responses to graded-intensity exercise {{under conditions of}} altered substrate availability were examined. Fifteen endurance-trained male athletes undertook exercise trials after a 2 -d high-carbohydrate diet (60 % CHO, 25 % fat) at baseline (D 0), on Day 14 (D 14), and after a single day of high fat intake (15 % CHO, 70 % fat) on Day 15 (D 15) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pair-matched design. Treatment consisted of 3 g LC (2 g L-carnitine/d; n = 8) or placebo (P, n = 7) for 15 d. Exercise trials consisted of 80 min of continuous cycling comprising 20 -min periods at each of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % VO 2 peak. There {{was no significant difference}} between whole-body rates of CHO and fat oxidation at any workload between D 0 and D 14 trials for either the P or LC group. Both groups displayed increased fat and reduced carbohydrate oxidation between the D 14 and D 15 trials (p less than . 05). During the D 15 trial, heart rate (p less than . 05 for 20 %, 40 %, and 60 % workloads) and blood glucose concentration (p less than . 05 for 40 % and 60 % workloads) were lower during exercise in the LC group than in P. These responses suggest that LC may induce subtle changes in substrate handling in metabolically active tissues when fatty-acid availability is increased, but it does not affect whole-body substrate utilization during short-duration exercise at the intensities studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the influence of <b>L-carnitine</b> <b>L-tartrate</b> (LCLT) supplementation using a balanced, cross-over, placebo-controlled research design on the anabolic hormone response (i. e., testosterone [T], insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-binding pro-tein- 3 [IGFBP- 3], and immunofunctional and immunoreac-tive growth hormone [GHif and GHir]) to acute resistance exercise. Ten healthy, recreationally weight-trained men (mean +/- SD age 23. 7 +/- 2. 3 years, weight 78. 7 +/- 8. 5 kg, and height 179. 2 +/- 4. 6 cm) volunteered and were matched, and after 3 weeks of supplementation (2 g LCLT per day), fasting morning blood samples were obtained on six consecutive days (D 1 -D 6). Subjects performed a squat protocol (5 sets of 15 - 20 repetitions) on D 2. During the squat protocol, blood samples were obtained before exercise and 0, 15, 30, 120, and 180 minutes postexercise. After a 1 -week washout period, subjects consumed the other supplement for a 3 -week period, and the same experimental protocol was repeated using the exact same procedures. Expected exercise-induced increases in all of the hormones were observed for GHir, GHif, IGFBP- 3, and T. Over the recovery period, LCLT reduced the amount of exercise-induced muscle tissue damage, which was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging scans of the thigh. LCLT supplementation significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) increased IGFBP- 3 concentrations prior to and at 30, 120, and 180 minutes after acute exercise. No other direct effects of LCLT supplementation were observed on the absolute concentrations of the hormones examined, but with more undamaged tissue, a greater number of intact receptors would be available for hormonal interactions. These data support the use of LCLT as a recovery supplement for hypoxic exercise and lend further insights into the hormonal mechanisms that may help to mediate quicker recovery...|$|E
40|$|Infusion of {{carnitine}} {{has been}} observed to increase non-oxidative glucose disposal in several studies but the effect of oral carnitine on glucose disposal in non-diabetic lean vs. overweight/obese humans has not been examined. This study {{examined the effects of}} 14 days <b>L-Carnitine</b> <b>L-Tartrate</b> oral supplementation (LC) on blood glucose, insulin, NEFA and GLP- 1 responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Sixteen male participants were recruited (lean (n= 8) and overweight/obese (n= 8)). After completing a submaximal predictive exercise test, participants were asked to attend three experimental sessions. These three visits were conducted, in the morning to obtain fasting blood samples and to conduct 2 hr OGTT’s. The first visit was a familiarisation trial and the final two visits were conducted two weeks apart following 14 days of ingestion of placebo (PL, 3 g glucose/day) then LC (3 g LC/day) ingested as 2 capsules 3 x/day with meals. On each visit blood was drawn at rest, at intervals during the OGTT for analysis of glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and total glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1). Data obtained were used for determination of usual insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA-IR, AUC glucose, AUC insulin, 1 st phase and 2 nd phase β-cell function, estimated insulin sensitivity index, and estimated metabolic clearance rate). Data were analysed using RMANOVA and post-hoc comparisons where appropriate. There was a significant difference between groups for body mass, % fat and BMI with no significant difference in age and height. Mean (SEM) plasma glucose concentration at 30 minutes was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the lean group on the LC trial compared with PL (8. 71 (0. 70) PL; 7. 32 (0. 36) LC; mmol/L). Conversely, plasma glucose concentration was not different at 30 minutes but was significantly higher at 90 minutes (p < 0. 05) in the overweight/obese group on the LC trial (5. 09 (0. 41) PL; 7. 11 (0. 59) LC; mmol/L). Estimated 1 st phase and 2 nd phase β-cell function both tended to be greater following LC in the lean group only. No effects of LC were observed on NEFA or total GLP- 1 response to OGTT. It is concluded that LC supplementation induces changes in blood glucose handling/disposal during an OGTT which is not influenced by GLP- 1. The glucose handling/disposal response to oral LC is different between lean and overweight/obese suggesting further investigation is required. LC effects on gastric emptying and/or direct ‘insulin-like’ actions on tissues should be examined in larger samples of overweight/obese and lean participants, respectively...|$|E
