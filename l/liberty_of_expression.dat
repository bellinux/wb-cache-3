In Sydney, people gathered at Martin Place– {{the location of a}} siege less than a month earlier– and in Hyde Park dressed in white clothing as a form of respect. [...] Flags were at half-mast at the city's French consulate where mourners left bouquets. A vigil was held at Federation Square in Melbourne with an emphasis on togetherness. French consul Patrick Kedemos described the gathering in Perth as [...] "a spontaneous, grass roots event". He added, [...] "We are far away but our hearts today [...] with our families and friends in France. It [...] an attack on the <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression,</b> journalists that were prominent in France, {{and at the same time}} it's an attack, or a perceived attack on our culture." ...|$|E

At the last PM Congress, which took place in Târgu Mureş in November 1937, it was asserted that the Romanian government was promoting a policy of assimilation toward minorities, and of violating their rights and <b>liberties</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression.</b> In the 1937 election, the PM won 4.43% of the vote, 19 seats in the Assembly and 2 in the Senate. In advance of the 1938 election, the PM (with the Hungarian ambassador to Bucharest acting as intermediary) reached an electoral alliance with the governing National Christian Party. However, as the royal dictatorship was installed on February 10, 1938, this election never took place.|$|R

[...] In a measure, they are owing--what good is in them--to the discovery of many lies, and the escape from the power of evil. Not to liberty, but to the deliverance from evil or cruel masters. Brave men have dared to examine lies which had long been taught, {{not because they were}} free-thinkers, but because they were such stern and close thinkers that the lie could no longer escape them. Of course the restriction of thought, or of its expression, by persecution, is merely a form of violence, justifiable or not, as other violence is, according to the character of the persons against whom it is exercised, and the divine and eternal laws which it vindicates or violates. We must not burn a man alive for saying that the Athanasian creed is ungrammatical, nor stop a bishop's salary because we are getting the worst of an argument with him; neither must we let drunken men howl in the public streets at night. There is much that is true in the part of Mr. Mill's essay on Liberty which treats of freedom of thought; some important truths are there beautifully expressed, but many, quite vital, are omitted; and the balance, therefore, is wrongly struck. The <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression,</b> with a great nation, would become like that in a well-educated company, in which there is indeed freedom of speech, but not of clamor; or like that in an orderly senate, in which men who deserve to be heard, are heard in due time, and under determined restrictions. The degree of liberty you can rightly grant to a number of men is in the inverse ratio of their desire for it; and a general hush, or call to order, would be often very desirable in this England of ours. For the rest, of any good or evil extent, it is impossible to say what measure is owing to restraint, and what to license where the right is balanced between them. I was not a little provoked one day, a summer or two since, in Scotland, because the Duke of Athol hindered me from examining the gneiss and slate junctions in Glen Tilt, at the hour convenient to me; but I saw them at last, and in quietness; and to the very restriction that annoyed me, owed, probably, the fact of their being in existence, instead of being blasted away by a mob-company; while the [...] "free" [...] paths and inlets of Loch Katrine and the Lake of Geneva are forever trampled down and destroyed, not by one duke, but by tens of thousands of ignorant tyrants.|$|E
