5|$|According to Jain texts, Mahavira's nirvana (death) {{occurred}} {{in the town of}} Pawapuri (Bihar). His life as a spiritual light and the night of his nirvana is remembered by Jains as Diwali on the same night that Hindus celebrate their festival of <b>lights.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night that Mahavira died, his chief disciple Gautama is said to have attained omniscience.|$|E
5|$|Bubble lights, {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} novelty light, {{were invented}} by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA launched the novelty <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular. Their main feature was a sealed glass tube with a colored bubbling liquid inside.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2008, Brian Crosby {{announced}} {{his decision to}} leave Bell X1 following their 19 October Flock tour finale at the Panorama Festival in the Lebanon. They parted ways on good terms and the recruitment {{of at least one}} new member for live performances was planned. Their first show without Crosby was the opening night of an acoustic tour at the Pavilion in Cork two days after Panorama. By this time they were already performing material which was to feature on their fourth studio album, Blue <b>Lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Runway.|$|E
5|$|There are traffic <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, {{which are}} used to {{indicate}} {{the state of the}} river in times of flood. Green indicates that flows are low or normal, and boats can proceed along this stretch. Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates that flows are very high and boats must not use the section.|$|E

5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including the <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights {{to the base of}} Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{events of}} a local scope include the {{university}} boat-race, held in the University Park since 1991, {{which has become a}} local spectator event attracting some 20,000 people. The boat race pits costumed teams from the university departments against each other in inflatable boats in a challenge to win the Gyldne Bækken (Golden Chamber Pot) trophy. The annual lighting of the Christmas <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Salling department store in Søndergade has also become an attraction in recent times, packing the pedestrianised city centre with thousands of revellers. Significant dates such as Saint Lucy's Day, Sankt Hans (Saint John's Eve) and Fastelavn are traditionally celebrated with numerous events across the city.|$|E

5|$|The Man-of-War (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like the <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green {{means that there is}} at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} south chancel stained glass is {{in memory of the}} wife, son, and {{daughter}} of Hugh Wynne Jones, who died in the mid-19th century. He was the first priest to be vicar of the parish (1868–1888); his predecessors had been curates, a lower position. He is depicted as Simeon, who in Luke's Gospel receives Jesus and his family when they visit the Temple of Jerusalem after the birth of Jesus (an event celebrated as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). The north transept has a three-light window to the north depicting St Edern, by Franz Mayer & Co. There are also windows with two <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east and west sides of the transept, one of which has a window from 1951 by Celtic Studios.|$|E

5|$|The town's tram, {{trolleybus}} and {{bus fleet}} was always painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold lining {{out until the}} outbreak of World War II. The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements, with the town's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts; and they carried two green <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, to enable the town's ratepayers to see at night {{which was one of}} the town's own buses and not one of those of a competitor. At local government reorganisation in April 1974, the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport. The former Corporation tram/bus garage in Melverley Street is still in use by First Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
5|$|Driving {{through the}} pass is challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades {{due to the}} height of the pass, and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic <b>lights.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur at any time of the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E

5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod, {{built in}} the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early {{computer}} custom-built to play a computer game, {{one of the first}} games developed in the early history of video games. The twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot (3.7-by-2.7-by-1.5-metre) computer, designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams, allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of Nim against an artificial intelligence. The player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machine to select their moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its calculations represented by more lights. The speed of the Nimrod's calculations could be slowed down to allow the presenter to demonstrate exactly what the computer was doing, with more lights showing the state of the calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the game than the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.|$|E

Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was <b>lighter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side and when given the opportunity to create <b>light</b> <b>on</b> an already existing painting.|$|R
