30|$|The {{absolute}} {{difference between}} depth rate of long session and depth {{rate of the}} <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session in the long session |max(D_L)L_Long - max(D_S)L_Short |. To compute this feature, we need at first find out the <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session in one long session. Then we calculate the maximum log’s depth in this <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session max(DS) and the <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session’s total length LShort. This feature describes how the depth pattern of one user’s long session is different from this user’s pattern of the <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session. This feature is close to zero for crawlers, who have consistent depth rates for their <b>short</b> sessions and <b>long</b> sessions.|$|R

30|$|Third, if a user {{visits a}} group of web pages {{continuously}}, we observe that most time gaps between two continuously logs are less than 10 s. Therefore, we set 10 s as the time threshold for a short session. Fourth, the lengths of active users’ <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session are similar. Most active users’ <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> sessions contain 20 - 30 log entries. We set {{the length of a}} long session as 60 since we recommend the long session to be twice as a user’s <b>longest</b> <b>short</b> session.|$|R

25|$|Early in the 20th century, William Nelson Page, a civil {{engineer}} and coal mining manager, joined forces with a silent partner, industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers (a principal of Standard Oil {{and one of the}} wealthiest men in the world), to develop the Deepwater Railway, a modest 85-mile <b>long</b> <b>short</b> line railroad to access untapped bituminous coal reserves {{in some of the most}} rugged sections of southern West Virginia. When Page was blocked by collusion of the bigger railroads, who refused to grant reasonable rates to interchange the coal traffic, he did not quit. As he continued building the original project, to provide their own link, using Rogers' resources and attorneys they quietly incorporated another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway. In this name, they secured the right-of-way needed all the way across Virginia to reach Hampton Roads, where a new coal pier was erected at Sewell's Point.|$|E

Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck and cheeks either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman-type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armor included hardened leather scale or lamellar armor and mail armor. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armored than horsemen. Large wooden or wickerwork shields were used. Long-shafted spears were used, with infantry spears being [...] long and cavalry spears being up to [...] <b>long.</b> <b>Short</b> infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used; long swords were usually carried by horsemen.

6000|$|That a {{misunderstanding}} {{of this kind}} is likely to grow up, becomes obvious when we {{bear in mind the}} great indefiniteness of primitive language. As Prof. Max Müller says, respecting certain misinterpretations of an opposite kind: [...] "These metaphors ... would become mere names handed down in the conversation of a family, understood perhaps by the grandfather, familiar to the father, but strange to the son, and misunderstood by the grandson." [...] We have ample reason, then, for supposing such misinterpretations. Nay, we may go further. We are justified in saying that they are certain to occur. For undeveloped languages contain no words capable of indicating the distinction to be kept in view. In the tongues of existing inferior races, only concrete objects and acts are expressible. The Australians have a name for each kind of tree, but no name for tree irrespective of kind. And though some witnesses allege that their vocabulary is not absolutely destitute of generic names, its extreme poverty in such is unquestionable. Similarly with the Tasmanians. Dr. Milligan says they [...] "had acquired very limited powers of abstraction or generalization. They possessed no words representing abstract ideas; for each variety of gum-tree and wattle-tree, etc., etc., they had a name, but they had no equivalent for the expression, 'a tree;' neither could they express abstract qualities, such as hard, soft, warm, cold, <b>long,</b> <b>short,</b> round, etc.; for 'hard,' they would say 'like a stone;' for 'tall,' they would say 'long legs,' etc.; and for 'round,' they said 'like a ball,' 'like the moon,' and so on, usually suiting the action to the word, and confirming, by some sign, the meaning to be understood."[31] Now, even making allowance for over-statement here (which seems needful, since the word [...] "long," [...] said to be inexpressible in the abstract, subsequently occurs as qualifying a concrete in the expression, [...] "long legs"), it is manifest that so imperfect a language must fail to convey the idea of a name, as something separate from a thing; and that still less can it be capable of indicating the act of naming. Familiar use of such partially-abstract words as are applicable to all objects of a class, is needful before there can be reached the conception of a name--a word symbolizing the symbolic character of other words; and the conception of a name, with its answering abstract term, must be long current before the verb to name can arise. Hence, men with speech so rude, cannot transmit the tradition of an ancestor named [...] "the Wolf", as distinguished from the actual wolf. The children and grandchildren who saw him will not be led into error; but in later generations, descent from [...] "the Wolf" [...] will inevitably come to mean descent from the animal known by that name. And the ideas and sentiments which, as above shown, naturally grow up round the belief that the dead parents and grandparents are still alive, and ready, if propitiated, to befriend their descendants, will be extended to the wolf species.|$|E
