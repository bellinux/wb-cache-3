5|$|The Gosforth Cross (920–950), in Cumbria, England, is a {{standing}} cross {{of a typical}} Anglo-Saxon form, carved {{on all sides of}} the <b>long</b> <b>shaft,</b> which is nearly square in section. Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the Ragnarök story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The Ragnarök battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir.|$|E
25|$|Flags, standards, and banners {{have always}} been {{important}} national and imperial symbols for Iranians, both in war and peace. Xenophon reports that Cyrus the Great's standard was a golden eagle with spread wings, mounted on a <b>long</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the pelvis}} {{there was a}} little notch in the front edge of the ilium. The {{relatively}} <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> of the ischium curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the metatarsus.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method of heat treating-straightening of <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> with low rigidity. Analytical relationships for {{the determination of}} rectilinearity of shaft axis in heat treating- straightening are presented. A fixture for heat treating-straightening of shafts was developed. The experiment conducted {{as well as the}} calculations confirm high effectiveness of the developed method of heat treating-straightening of <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> with low rigidity. Application of the developed technology of heat treating-straightening permits minimisation of the value of deflection of semi-finished product and stabilisation of the level of residual longitudinal stress, which results in enhanced operational accuracy of <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> with low rigidity, improved quality and operation parameters of finished products...|$|R

25|$|A 150hp Hispano-Suiza 8Aa {{water-cooled}} engine located immediately aft of {{the wings}} drove a two blade pusher propeller mounted {{at the extreme}} tail, via a <b>long</b> <b>shaft.</b> Using a ventral fin with a long tail skid to protect the propeller and a short vertical stabilizer, the C1 had no fixed horizontal stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was the incorporation of the camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|E
25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E

50|$|In the 9th century, Hungarian warriors used light axes on <b>long</b> <b>shafts,</b> called fokos, {{in their}} {{military}} arsenal during their invasion of Central Europe. Apart from them, the Bulgars {{and also the}} Alans and Slavs used similar weapons.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a {{new technique}} of skew rolling with three tapered rolls and its application {{to the production of}} <b>long</b> main <b>shafts</b> of steel that are used in light trucks. First, the design of this forming technique is described. Then the paper stresses the universality of this process, as the skew rolling technique enables forming various products using one set of rolls. The reported numerical results (workpiece shape change during rolling, maps of effective strains and temperatures as well as loads and torques) confirm that the discussed technique is suitable for producing <b>long</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Wyvern {{began as}} a Westland project for a naval strike fighter, with the engine located behind the pilot, driving a {{propeller}} in the nose via a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> that passed under the cockpit floor, similar to the Bell P-39. This enabled the pilot to be located in a position that conferred the best possible visibility over the nose for carrier operations. Official interest resulted in Air Ministry Specification N.11/44 for a long-range naval fighter using the 24-cylinder H-block Rolls-Royce Eagle 22 piston engine (unrelated to the First World War-era engine of the same name) being issued to cover Westland's design. The specification also called for an airframe design that {{would be able to}} take a turboprop engine when a suitable unit was available. There was a parallel specification for the Royal Air Force, F.13/44, for which Hawker submitted the competing P.1027, a development of the Tempest. The RAF variant was cancelled, when in 1945 it was decided that all future fighter aircraft would be jet-powered.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{feathers}} {{are also}} used by some species in visual displays. [...] Male standard-winged and pennant-winged nightjars have modified P2 primaries (using the descendant numbering scheme explained above) which are displayed during their courtship rituals. [...] In the standard-winged nightjar, this modified primary consists of an extremely <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> with a small [...] "pennant" [...] (actually a large web of barbules) at the tip. In the pennant-winged nightjar, the P2 primary is an extremely long (but otherwise normal) feather, while P3, P4 and P5 are successively shorter; the overall effect is a broadly forked wingtip with a very long plume beyond {{the lower half of}} the fork.|$|E
500|$|Re-appearing in [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] {{were the}} {{traditional}} Vulcan weapon, the lirpa, which {{was first introduced}} in The Original Series episode [...] "Amok Time". The lirpa is a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> with a crescent blade on one end and a spiked cudgel on the other. Brand new props were built for this episode, modifying the original design by making them more lightweight. They were wielded in [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] by Vulcan commandos, who were all played by stunt actors in non-speaking roles. Additional stunt doubles were required for Archer, T'Pol, T'Pau and Talok while two puppeteers were needed for the Andorian antennae seen on screen.|$|E
50|$|Self-aligning spherical {{bearings}} {{were first}} used by James Nasmyth around 1840 to support line shaft bearings in mills and machine shops. For <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> {{it was impossible}} to accurately align bearings, even if the shaft was perfectly straight. Nasmyth used brass bearing shells between hemispherical brass cups to align the bearings to self-align.|$|R

60|$|Now we three lay {{where could}} be had {{a view of}} all our surroundings, and during the next hour, {{at the end of}} which time the sun was sending <b>long</b> <b>shafts</b> of light through the {{openings}} in the forest, we succeeded in sending five of the scoundrels to their happy hunting-grounds, or back under cover disabled by serious wounds.|$|R
500|$|Each of the torches {{contained}} a solid fuel tablet made of hexamine and 6% naphthalene (following torch running tests in May 1947) that fuelled the flame itself. [...] The solid fuel increased the distance each runner could run to [...] over flat terrain, decreasing {{the number of}} torches needed to be produced, which in turn reduced {{the cost of the}} relay. There were eight tablets loaded into each torch, with the bottom tablets pushed up by the use of a spring. The design increased the burning time of each torch up to around fifteen minutes, an increase from the four-minute torches of the 1936 Olympics. The torch itself was designed by Ralph Lavers, with the brief that it should be [...] "inexpensive and easy to make, of pleasing appearance and a good example of British craftmanship". The torches were made from aluminium, with a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> holding a cup that contained the burner. [...] "With thanks to the bearer" [...] was written on the cup of the torch itself, along with the Olympic rings. The torches for the Greek leg of the relay were shipped to the Mediterranean aboard HMS Liverpool, along with a purpose built torch for the leg aboard a Royal Navy vessel from Corfu to Italy.|$|E
2500|$|A {{knitting}} needle or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting to produce knitted fabrics. [...] They generally have a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> and taper at their end, {{but they are not}} nearly as sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E
2500|$|Included {{in the new}} dome was {{a feature}} dubbed the [...] "whaleback" [...] (named such because of its close {{resemblance}} {{to the back of}} a whale), which was a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> of solidified magma being extruded by pressure of magma underneath it. This feature was very hot but fragile. The edges of it began crumbling rapidly, forming loose material around the new dome. [...] The rate of crumbling soon matched the rate of growth, with the size of the whaleback remaining fairly constant.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{distinct}} from other true limpets in the following ways, among others: its intestine runs through its ventricle, it has a pair of radular [...] "teeth" [...] with <b>long</b> <b>shafts,</b> and its statocysts are isolated from the pleural ganglia and pedal ganglia. It also has a ctenidium rather than the usual set of circumpallial gills, lacks osphradia, and does not have even rudimentary eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Designed by Bell Aircraft, {{it had an}} {{innovative}} layout, with the engine installed in the center fuselage, behind the pilot, and driving a tractor propeller via a <b>long</b> <b>shaft.</b> It {{was also the first}} fighter fitted with a tricycle undercarriage. [...] Although its mid-engine placement was innovative, the P-39 design was handicapped by the absence of an efficient turbo-supercharger, preventing it from performing high-altitude work. As such it was rejected by the RAF for use over western Europe but adopted by the USSR where most air combat took place at medium and lower altitudes.|$|E
2500|$|The Radley-England Waterplane was a four-bay biplane with ailerons {{fitted to}} the top wing only. [...] A single {{horizontal}} stabiliser and elevator with twin balanced rudders mounted below it were carried on four wire-braced booms behind the wing. The crew and passengers were carried {{in a pair of}} flat-bottomed floats suspended on struts underneath the lower wing. [...] It was powered by three 50hp (37kW) Gnome Omega rotary engines arranged in line above the wing centre section, each connected by a roller chain to a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> at the rear of which was a four-bladed propeller 9ft 10in (3m) diameter. [...] To protect the occupants from the oil thrown out, the front engine was partially enclosed by an aluminium cowling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, the Royal Aircraft Factory {{designed}} {{an experimental}} armed pusher biplane, the F.E.3 ("Farman" [...] or [...] "Fighting" [...] Experimental), with the alternative designation A.E.1 ("Armed Experimental"). The F.E.3 was {{to carry a}} Coventry Ordnance Works 1½ lb shell-firing quick loading gun. [...] In {{order to reduce the}} drag associated with the pusher layout favoured for gun-carrying aircraft, the tail was carried on a single tubular tailboom connected by bearings to the four-bladed propeller, with bracing wires running to the wings and undercarriage. The crew of two, gunner and pilot, sat in tandem in a wood and metal nacelle. The aircraft was powered by a single water-cooled Chenu inline engine mounted in the nose of the nacelle, connected to a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> running under the cockpit which drove the propeller using a chain drive. [...] The gun was to fire through the cooling intake for the engine.|$|E
5000|$|The irons from 2 to 4 are {{typically}} called the [...] "long irons"; {{they have the}} lowest lofts and the <b>longest</b> <b>shafts,</b> and are designed {{to hit the ball}} long distances (180-260 yards) with a low launch angle. They {{are typically}} used from the fairway or rough, but are also useful in trouble spots such as when [...] "punching out" [...] from underneath a stand of trees.|$|R

2500|$|Representations of {{the resurrection}} {{continued}} to evolve in the Renaissance, though the cross-banner in Christ's hand, representing victory over death, was often retained. In Pietro Perugino's depiction at the Vatican the tomb has a conventional style. Leonardo da Vinci used a rock-hewn cave. The [...] "Resurrection cross" [...] or [...] "Triumphal cross" [...] (Crux longa in Latin) is a simple, somewhat <b>long,</b> <b>shaft</b> crossed at the top from which a banner may float. Christ bears this in his hand in many depictions, as his standard of power, and the conqueror over death and Hell. However this must be distinguished from the shaft depicted in the hand of Saint John the Baptist which is a reed. The banner on the Triumphal cross is usually white and has a red cross, symbolizing {{the victory of the}} resurrected Christ over death. The symbol derived from the 4th century vision of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great and his use of a cross on the Roman Standard.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 Breguet Aviation flew {{both their}} {{all-metal}} Breguet 19, a bomber/reconnaissance aircraft and the Breguet 20. The latter was another all-metal biplane but much larger and powered by two Breguet-Bugatti U.16 [...] " [...] double" [...] engines, each {{a pair of}} water cooled straight-eight engines with a single output shaft. The engines were placed centrally in the fuselage and drove a nose-mounted single propeller through a <b>long</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] Unlike the very successful Breguet 19, the Breguet 20 proved unsatisfactory and was developed into the otherwise very similar Breguet 22, which {{had a pair of}} Breguet-Bugatti U.16s mounted between the wings on either side. Since the double engines could continue to run with one half shut down, both the Breguet 20 and 22 were sometimes referred to as four-engined aircraft (e.g.L'Aerophile). Moving the engines from the fuselage to the wings freed the fuselage for a passenger cabin which could hold 22, a large number in those days. Both the Type 20 and Type 22 were referred to as the Breguet Leviathan by contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|The Type L did {{not have}} a long, {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead the empennage was supported on an open girder. [...] The Type L, unusually for Caudron, had two parallel sided, cross braced side frames. The longitudinal members were steel and the cross-members ash. [...] The side frames began from the rear spars of both upper and lower wings and converged rearwards to meet at the tail, with upper and lower cross-members towards the rear. [...] A short nacelle on the lower wing contained an open, wide cockpit with side-by-side seating, the pilot on the right. [...] Controls were conventional. [...] The nacelle ended behind the forward wing spar, ahead of the [...] Gnome Delta nine cylinder rotary engine mounted on the rear interplane struts and driving a two blade propeller via 2:1 reduction gearing and a <b>long</b> <b>shaft</b> to clear the trailing edge. At the extreme tail, the final vertical frame member served as the axis for the rudder, with a small, roughly triangular fin ahead of it. The elevator hinge was also mounted high on this member, with a straight edged tailplane ahead of it.|$|E
