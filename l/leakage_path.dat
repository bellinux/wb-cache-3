It might {{seem that the}} transformer would be a <b>leakage</b> <b>path</b> for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current.

25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state <b>leakage</b> <b>path,</b> causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

40|$|Many {{buildings}} in Sweden {{are in need}} of renovation {{in order to meet the}} current standards of energy use in buildings. Particularly challenging are old listed buildings, the majority built before 1950, because the renovation is restricted to the parts that do not change the appearance of the building. This paper presents experiences gained during the renovation of a listed building where aging of materials, movements and settlements during the building operation have left trails in form of air <b>leakage</b> <b>paths</b> that are difficult to cover by renovation. The aim of the work is to bring up certain issues related to air movements in old houses that are not necessarily present in new ones. In the renovation project in question, efforts were made to seal the exterior walls with polyethylene foil before additional insulation in form of vacuum insulating panels was installed. The blower door tests taken in the apartments showed that the air permeability of the building remained basically unchanged after the retrofit. Complementary diagnostics with thermal imaging camera revealed that air <b>leakage</b> <b>paths</b> in intermediate floors and interior walls substantially contributed to the overall air leakage of the building. It was then concluded that the blower door tests alone were not sufficient for the estimation of the air permeability of the building. In addition, hygrothermal measurements in exterior walls showed that new air <b>leakage</b> <b>paths</b> were created between the old wall and the additional insulation. By using numerical simulations, it has been proven that it is the outdoor air that flows through these new air paths, which is advantageous from the moisture safety point of view. However, the flow of outdoor air through the exterior wall increases the overall thermal transmittance of the wall and thus decreases the effects of additional insulation...|$|R
