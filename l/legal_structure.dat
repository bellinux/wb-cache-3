25|$|Fish {{and game}} laws {{regulate}} {{the right to}} pursue and take or kill certain kinds of fish and wild animal (game). Such laws may restrict the days to harvest fish or game, the number of animals caught per person, the species harvested, or the weapons or fishing gear used. Such laws may seek to balance dueling needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both environment and populations of fish and game. Game laws can provide a <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> to collect license fees and other money {{which is used to}} fund conservation efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in wildlife management practice.|$|E
25|$|William reorganised {{the land}} {{structure}} in a piecemeal fashion, following {{the reduction of}} resistance {{in various parts of}} England. His major lords were granted new titles of the land. But the Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> was left largely intact, including the traditional sheriff (shire reeve) and courts of shire and hundred. Maitland is of the opinion that the law of William I and his successors was biased in favour of all things West Saxon (Wessex) and the Church, while eschewing and denigrating all things Danelaw. Bracton freely intermixes the Middle English terms such as sac (sake), soc (soke), toll and term, infangthef, utfangthef, thane, dreng, sokeman, hide, geld, hundred, wapentake, bote, wite and wer with Norman French terms such as baron, count, viscount, vavasor, villein, relief, homage, manor.|$|E
25|$|There remain {{several areas}} in which {{systemic}} problems appear to delay resolution of cases. Mexico has no implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system. The Convention, therefore, is implemented under existing state family code and varies from state to state. This lack of a <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> facilitating the Convention's operation is a major obstacle to the Convention's effective implementation in Mexico. Significant processing delays have occurred {{in at least two}} of the states. However, one of these states has recently notified the Mexican Central Authority that the primary judicial concern delaying cases has been resolved and has pledged to process cases more expeditiously. The Department is also encouraged by recent discussions with the Mexican Central Authority concerning plans for the development of implementing legislation.|$|E

25|$|Equity co-ops are {{buildings}} {{in which individuals}} purchase a percentage share {{of the building and}} the land on which it is built tied to the square footage of their unit; all owners own the building collectively, with exclusive rights to occupy their own unit. More credit unions will offer financing against them than against co-ownerships. They are a relatively new form of construction, designed to encourage owner occupancy by having the building's corporation hold back a percentage of the unit's share equity to ensure owner occupancy. This <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> is used as an alternative to condominium registration, either when the government will not allow conversion of an existing apartment building to a condominium, or to avoid the expense and difficulty of doing so.|$|E
25|$|The new <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> {{provided}} a single Court of Appeal, which heard appeals {{from all the}} various Divisions of the new unified High Court of Justice. It only heard civil cases (opportunities for appealing in criminal cases remained limited until the 20th century). In its early days, the Court of Appeal divided its sittings between Westminster Hall for appeals from the Common Law divisions, and Lincoln's Inn for Chancery, Probate, Divorce and Admiralty appeals, with five Lords Justices. After {{the opening of the}} Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 the Court of Appeal transferred there, where it remains. As well as the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, any previous Lord Chancellors, the Lord Chief Justice, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division and the Master of the Rolls could also hear cases, although in practice only the Master of the Rolls did so.|$|E
25|$|The founders' {{financial}} and <b>legal</b> <b>structure,</b> {{adapted from the}} model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, proposals to begin regulation of the whale hunt began to reach the Faroese legislature. On 4 June 1907, the Danish Governor (in Faroese: amtmaður), as well as the sysselmann (sheriff), sent the first draft for whaling regulations to the Office of the Exchequer in Copenhagen. In the following years, a number of drafts were debated, and finally in 1932 the first Faroese whaling regulations were introduced. As a part of the home rule act of 1948, fishing and hunting (such as whaling) laws and regulations are now governed by the Faroese Parliament. Since then, every detail of the pilot whale hunt has been carefully defined in the regulations. This means that the institution of the pilot whale hunt, which had previously largely been based on tradition, became an integrated part of society’s <b>legal</b> <b>structure.</b> In the regulations, one has institutionalized old customs and added new ordinances when old customs have proved insufficient or inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Peru's {{economic}} stabilization and liberalization program lowered trade barriers, eliminated restrictions on capital flows, {{and opened the}} economy to foreign investment, {{with the result that}} Peru now {{has one of the most}} open investment regimes in the world. Between 1992 and 2001, Peru attracted almost $17 billion in foreign direct investment in Peru, after negligible investment until 1991, mainly from Spain (32.35%), the United States (17.51%), Switzerland (6.99%), Chile (6.63%), and Mexico (5.53%). The basic <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> for foreign investment in Peru is formed by the 1993 constitution, the Private Investment Growth Law, and the November 1996 Investment Promotion Law. Although Peru does not have a bilateral investment treaty with the United States, it has signed an agreement (1993) with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) concerning OPIC-financed loans, guarantees, and investments. Peru also has committed itself to arbitration of investment disputes under the auspices of ICSID (the World Bank'sInternational Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes) or other international or national arbitration tribunals.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Principate and the Roman Empire is traditionally dated to 27 BC with the first Augustan constitutional settlement, where Octavian, the victor of the final war of the Roman Republic, gave up his extraordinary powers and was vested with proconsular authority over the imperial provinces, which he held along with the tribunician power granted {{to him by the}} Senate in 36 BC. Concurrently, he held the Roman consulship, granting him authority within the ordinary <b>legal</b> <b>structure</b> which did not exceed any of the other magistrates. By holding various republican offices, Augustus, as Octavian was known after 27 BC, was able to disguise the autocratic nature of his regime and claim a restoration of the republic. After more constitutional changes in 23 BC, Augustus was granted greater proconsular authority over all imperial provinces, which allowed him to override any other Roman governors, marking the completion of the various offices that most Roman emperors would hold until the transformation of the Principate into the Dominate in the late third century.|$|E
