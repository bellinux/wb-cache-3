In this paper, we present the first meta-analysis on the efficacy and tolerance of <b>lactitol</b> for adult constipation. Methods: We searched MEDLINE® and Embase, with no date or language restrictions, for studies of <b>lactitol</b> supplementation on adult constipation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed on pre- to posttreatment changes in stool frequency and consistency with <b>lactitol</b> among all studies, {{as well as a}} comparison of efficacy and tolerance outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>lactitol</b> versus lactulose. Results: A total of eleven studies representing 663 distinct patients were included in the final analysis, including five single-arm studies, four RCTs comparing <b>lactitol</b> with lactulose, one RCT comparing <b>lactitol</b> with placebo, and one nonrandomized controlled trial comparing <b>lactitol</b> with stimulant laxatives. Weekly stool frequency was significantly increased with <b>lactitol</b> compared with baseline (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 1. 56, P< 0. 001). Stool consistency also improved over the supplementation period with <b>lactitol</b> (SMD: 1. 04, P< 0. 001). Approximately one-third of patients experienced an adverse event; however, symptoms were generally mild and rarely (5 %) resulted in study withdrawal. In RCTs of <b>lactitol</b> versus lactulose, <b>lactitol</b> was slightly more effective than lactulose in increasing weekly stool frequency (SMD: 0. 19, P= 0. 06). No statistically significant differences between <b>lactitol</b> and lactulose were identified in any other efficacy or tolerance outcome. <b>Lactitol</b> demonstrated favorable efficacy and tolerance in individual studies when compared to stimulant laxatives and placebo. Conclusion: <b>Lactitol</b> supplementation is well tolerated and improves symptoms of adult constipation. The efficacy and tolerance of <b>lactitol</b> and lactulose are similar, with a trend for more frequent stools with <b>lactitol.</b> Limited evidence suggests <b>lactitol</b> is superior to stimulant laxatives and placebo for relieving constipation symptoms.

Moreover, 10 out of 14 patients suffered from recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy in the 12 months prior to the study. Patients were randomly treated for two consecutive periods of six months with either <b>lactitol</b> or lactulose. The PSE index was calculated to quantify the neuro-psychiatric impairment.

No deterioration in the mental state or in the other neuro-psychiatric parameters were observed, neither during <b>lactitol</b> nor during lactulose therapy.

40|$|<b>Lactitol,</b> an unabsorbed sugar with defined {{laxative}} {{threshold and}} superior taste properties {{has been suggested}} {{as an alternative to}} lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. In the present study we have compared the colonic metabolism of the two sugars using an in vitro faecal incubation system. Both sugars were readily metabolised by faecal bacteria producing volatile fatty acids and the metabolism was inhibited by neomycin.

40|$|Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Nonabsorbable disaccharides {{are widely}} used to {{decrease}} blood ammonia concentration. Their principal mode of action is the modification of pH and bacterial flora in the colon. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that these drugs may also reduce small intestine ammonia generation. METHODS: Eight male cirrhotics without overt hepatic encephalopathy received 20 g of glutamine in 100 mi of water. Venous samples for whole blood ammonia were taken before, 30 and 60 min after the load. Immediately after the last blood sample the patients were submitted to the following psychometric tests: number connection test, Posner's attention test, and Sternberg paradigm. After the first glutamine load, patients were started on <b>lactitol</b> (initial dose 20 g, three times a day). Once two bowel movements/day were obtained and maintained for at least 5 days, oral glutamine challenge and psychometric tests were repeated. RESULTS: Ammonia increased significantly after the glutamine load (from 83 +/- 13 to 164 +/- 30 mu g/dl at 30 min and 210 +/- 29 mu g/dl at 60 min; mean +/-SE; p = 0. 006 analysis of variance) but not after glutamine load after <b>lactitol</b> treatment (from 77 +/- 17 to Ill +/- 21 mu g/dl and 142 +/- 24 mu g/dl; p = not significant). The peak increment(127 +/- 24 vs 65 +/- 18 mu g/dl; p = 0. 008). of ammonia elevation was significantly smaller during <b>lactitol</b> administration. The patients' psychometric performance after the glutamine load did not differ significantly after <b>lactitol</b> treatment. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lactitol</b> reduces the elevation in blood ammonia that follows oral glutamine challenge. Because enterally administered glutamine is efficiently absorbed in the jejunum and, in part, metabolized to ammonia we suggest that <b>lactitol</b> affects small intestine ammonia generation probably by shortening the residence time of intestinal content...|$|E
