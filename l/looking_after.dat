40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore the key care factors that {{influence}} the educational achievement of children <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> at home and away from home in Scotland. Traditionally there has been less research conducted in Scotland than {{in the rest of}} the United Kingdom. The research analysed a large new sample - one fifth of the care leaving population in Scotland - and spans a five year period. The thesis makes an original research contribution. A unique features of the research is that it investigates the experiences of children <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> at home, alongside those <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> away from home. In addition, the research involved two large local authority areas in Scotland that had not previously participated in such research on <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children. What emerged from the research was that the Corporate Parent (local authorities and partner agencies) had not yet successfully prioritised the educational achievement of <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children in policy and practice, despite education being identified by the government as a mechanism for combating social exclusion. The key findings of the research demonstrated that <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children perform less well academically than the general school population. In particular, placement type, the reason for becoming <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> and the age on becoming <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> were significant factors in determining educational achievement. Other factors such as gender and number of placements were also found to be associated with educational achievement. Empirical results further indicated that <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children suffered from discrimination and social exclusion in all aspects of their lives, including school and where they lived. This was a significant finding as the disadvantage experienced by many <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children continues to impact on their lives into adulthood, making them some of the most socially excluded adults in Scotland and the United Kingdom today...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Children {{in state}} care (‘looked after {{children}}’) have poorer health than {{children who are}} not <b>looked</b> <b>after.</b> Recent developments in Scotland and elsewhere have aimed to improve services and outcomes for <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children. Routine monitoring of the health outcomes of <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children compared to those of their non-looked after peers is currently lacking. Developing capacity for comparative monitoring of population based outcomes based on linkage of routinely collected administrative data {{has been identified as}} a priority. To our knowledge there are no existing population based data linkage studies providing data on the health of <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> and non-looked after children at national level. Smaller scale studies that are available generally provide very limited information on linkage methods and hence do not allow scrutiny of bias that may be introduced through the linkage process. Study design and methods: National demonstration project testing the feasibility of linking routinely collected <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children, education, and health data. Participants: All children in publicly funded school in Scotland in 2011 / 12. Results: Linkage between <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children data and the national pupil census classified 10, 009 (1. 5 %) and 1, 757 (0. 3 %) of 670, 952 children as, respectively, currently and previously <b>looked</b> <b>after.</b> Recording of the unique pupil identifier (Scottish Candidate Number, SCN) on <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children returns is incomplete, with 66 % of <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> records for 2011 / 12 for children of possible school age containing a valid SCN. This will have resulted in some under-ascertainment of currently and, particularly, previously <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children within the general pupil population. Further linkage of the pupil census to the NHS Scotland master patient index demonstrated that a safe link to the child’s unique health service (Community Health Index, CHI) number could be obtained for a very high proportion of children in each group (94 %, 95 %, and 95 % of children classified as currently, previously, and non-looked after respectively). In general linkage rates were higher for older children and those living in more affluent areas. Within the <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> group, linkage rates were highest for children with the fewest placements and for those in permanent fostering. Conclusions: This novel data linkage demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring population based health outcomes of school aged <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> and non-looked after children using linked routine administrative data. Improved recording of the unique pupil identifier number on <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> data returns would be beneficial. Extending the range of personal identifiers on <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children returns would enable linkage to health data for <b>looked</b> <b>after</b> children who are not in publicly funded schooling (i. e. those who are pre- or post-school, home schooled, or in independent schooling) ...|$|R
