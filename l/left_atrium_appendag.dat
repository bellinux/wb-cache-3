The <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right <b>atrium,</b> the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> is lined by pectinate muscles. The <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|R
2500|$|In the <b>left</b> <b>atrium,</b> {{the volume}} {{overload}} causes {{enlargement of the}} <b>left</b> <b>atrium,</b> allowing the filling pressure in the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> to decrease.

40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{segmentation}} of the heart’s <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> offers great {{benefits for}} planning and outcome evaluation of atrial ablation procedures. However, the high anatomical variability of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> presents significant challenges for atlas-guided segmentation. In this paper, we demonstrate an automatic method for <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> segmentation using weighted voting label fusion and {{a variant of the}} demons registration algorithm adapted to handle images with different intensity distributions. We achieve accurate automatic segmentation that is robust to the high anatomical variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> in a clinical dataset of MRA images. Key words: Atlas-based segmentation, <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> segmentation, cardiac segmentation, label fusion, non-rigid registration. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} pressure overload of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> {{will cause the}} <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> to increase in size. As the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> increases in size, it becomes more prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF). When atrial fibrillation develops, the atrial kick is lost (since it {{is due to the}} normal atrial contraction).|$|R
40|$|Primary cardiac {{tumors are}} {{extremely}} rare and can originate within the heart or {{be the result}} of tumor spread from other sites. We report a female patient with a pulmonary vein tumor extending into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> that had a suspicious primary malignant origin with a sacral metastatic carcinoma. The patient was admitted complaining of pain in her buttock area {{as a result of a}} sacral tumor. It was believed that the sacral tumor was a metastasis from the imaging study and clinical manifestation. The primary malignant origin was evaluated. The chest CT showed a <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> thrombus-like lesion without a pulmonary abnormality. After a transesophageal echocardiogram, the patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary vein tumor extending to the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> The patient was given palliative radiotherapy for the sacral pain. Initially, the clinical impression was a metastatic sacral tumor with a thromboembolism of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> However, this patient was finally diagnosed with a pulmonary vein tumor with a <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> extension by a transesophageal echocardiogram.

25|$|Initially, {{a single}} {{pulmonary}} vein develops {{in the form}} of a bulge in the back wall of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> This vein will connect with the veins of the developing lung buds. As development proceeds the pulmonary vein and its branches are incorporated into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> and they both form the smooth wall of the <b>atrium.</b> The embryonic <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> remains as the trabecular left atrial appendage, and the embryonic right atrium remains as the right atrial appendage.|$|R
2500|$|The normal {{area of the}} {{mitral valve}} orifice is about 4 to 6cm2. In normal cardiac physiology, the mitral valve opens during left {{ventricular}} diastole, to allow blood to flow from the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> to the <b>left</b> ventricle. A normal mitral valve will not impede {{the flow of blood}} from the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> to the <b>left</b> ventricle during (ventricular) diastole, and the pressures in the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> and the <b>left</b> ventricle during ventricular diastole will be equal. [...] The result is that the left ventricle gets filled with blood during early ventricular diastole, with {{only a small portion of}} extra blood contributed by contraction of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> (the [...] "atrial kick") during late ventricular diastole.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} novel medical image {{analysis}} methods to improve planning and outcome evaluation of cardiac ablation procedures.

The high anatomical variability of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> shape and of the pulmonary veins that drain into it presents significant difficulties for cardiac ablation.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> is growing, {{although there are many}} aspects that are still poorly understood. The <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size as an imaging biomarker has been consistently shown to be a powerful predictor of outcomes and of different cardiovascular disorders, such as, but not limited to, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation and stroke. Left atrial function has been conventionally divided into three integrated phases: reservoir, conduit and booster-pump. The highly dynamic <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> and its response to the stretch and secretion of atrial neuropeptides leaves the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> far from being a simple transport chamber.

40|$|AbstractLeft atrial {{dissection}} {{is a very}} uncommon {{complication of}} cardiac surgery and usually causes significant hemodynamic compromise. Little is known about spontaneous dissection of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> Two patients, one middle-aged man and another elderly woman were evaluated following stroke. Routine trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed vertical division of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> with both chambers communicating with each other through an orifice. Detailed trans-oesophageal echocardiographic study revealed dissection of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> producing an additional false chamber (pseudo-aneurysm) placed posterior to the left atrial appendage and above the postero-lateral aspect of mitral annulus.

5000|$|Mitral valve repair is {{a cardiac}} surgery {{procedure}} performed by cardiac surgeons to treat stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leakage) of the mitral valve. The mitral valve is the [...] "inflow valve" [...] {{for the left}} side of the heart. Blood flows from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen, through the pulmonary veins, to the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> of the heart. After the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> fills with blood, the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> into the heart's main pumping chamber called the left ventricle. It then closes to keep blood from leaking back into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> or lungs when the ventricle contracts (squeezes) to push blood out to the body. It has two flaps, or leaflets, known as cusps.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{birth and}} {{separation}} from the placenta, the oxygen content in the inferior vena cava falls. With the onset of breathing, the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. As {{blood flow to the}} lungs increases, the amount of blood flow entering the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> increases. When the pressure in the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, the foramen ovale begins to close and limits the blood flow between the <b>left</b> and right <b>atrium.</b> While the eustachian valve persists in adult life, it essentially does not have a specific function after the gestational period.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of left heart failure caused by a sliding hiatus hernia {{compressing}} on <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> A 95 -year-old woman was admitted with recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and chest pain. The cause was uncertain as she had normal cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiography. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed an intrathoracic mass behind the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> causing external compression of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> suggestive of sliding hiatus hernia. We present such a case and possible mechanisms of heart failure...|$|R
5000|$|Characterizing {{the size}} of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> {{according}} to its volume is preferred over a single linear dimension since enlargement can be different for different directions. For example, because of the smaller distance in the thoracic cavity between the sternum and spine, compared to the other directions, less room exists for enlargement of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> along the anteroposterior axis. [...] By approximating the shape of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> as an ellipsoid, its volume can be calculated from measurements of its dimensions along three perpendicular directions.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{the three}} lobar veins {{on the right}} side remain separate, and not {{infrequently}} the two left lobar veins end by a common opening into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> Therefore, the number of pulmonary veins opening into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> can vary between three and five in the healthy population.|$|R
50|$|Surgical {{correction}} {{should be}} considered in the presence of significant left to right shunting (Qp:Qs ≥ 2:1) and pulmonary hypertension. This involves creation of an inter-atrial baffle to redirect the pulmonary venous return into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> Alternatively, the anomalous vein can be re-implanted directly into the <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b>|$|R
50|$|Left atrial {{enlargement}} can be mild, moderate {{or severe}} {{depending on the}} extent of the underlying condition. Although other factors may contribute, <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size {{has been found to be}} a predictor of mortality due to both cardiovascular issues as well as all-cause mortality. Current research suggests that <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size as measured by an echo-cardiograph may have prognostic implications for preclinical cardiovascular disease. However, studies that have found LAE to be a predictor for mortality recognize the need for more standardized <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> measurements than those found in an echo-cardiogram.|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is common}} supraventricular arrhythmia associated with arterial hypertension. The mechanisms that affect arterial hypertension causing atrial fibrillation are various and include: left ventricle hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, left ventricle impaired function and <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> enlargement. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the size of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension patients. The investigation comprised a group of 117 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients. Of this number, 87 patients had arterial hypertension, and 30 patients were without arterial hypertension and other disorders and diseases (LONE). The arterial hypertension patients were divided into 3 groups: the arterial hypertension patients, those without left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia; the arterial hypertension patients, those with left ventricle hypertrophy but without ischemia and the arterial hypertension patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease. The patients without arterial hypertension and other disorders and diseases (LONE) represented the fourth group. The size of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> was recorded by echocardiography. The highest average <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size value was found in the arterial hypertension patients, those with concomitant ischemic heart disease and it was 43, 39 mm; in the arterial hypertension patients with left ventricle hypertrophy but without ischemia, it amounted to 39, 85 mm. The average <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size value in arterial hypertension patients, those without left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia was 37, 24 mm, and the lowest average <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size value was in the patients without arterial hypertension (LONE) and it was 34, 61 mm. On this number, 80. 95 % of arterial hypertension patients, those with concomitant ischemic heart disease as well as 45. 45 % of arterial hypertension patients with left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia had the enlarged <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> The patients without arterial hypertension (LONE) did not have the enlarged <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> It may be concluded that the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> size in the arterial hypertension patients in the presence of left ventricle hypertrophy, and especially with the concomitant ischemic heart disease, represents a significant prerequisite for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation genesis. The highest percentage of the patients with enlarged <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> in the group with arterial hypertension and concomitant ischemic heart disease proves that the ischemic heart disease is the most common arrhythmic factor. The left ventricle hypertrophy immediately follows the ischemic heart disease...|$|R
50|$|During inspiration, {{pressure}} in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the <b>left</b> <b>atrium,</b> subsequently a reduction in flow to the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> and ventricle happens.

40|$|AbstractMassive {{calcification}} of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> is {{an uncommon}} complication of long-standing rheumatic valve disease, and is frequently revealed {{in patients with}} a previous operation on the mitral valve. An 84 -year-old woman, who {{had a history of}} rheumatic valvulopathy and mitral-aortic valve replacement surgery 35 years previously, was admitted to our hospital due to congestive heart failure. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly with rim of calcification outlining the enlarged <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> Computed tomographic scan of the thorax clearly illustrated dense and partially thick plate-like calcification of left atrial free wall and interatrial septum. She died due to congestive heart failure 14 days after hospitalization and an autopsy was performed. Enlargement of <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> with massive calcification was evident by gross pathology. Thick plate-like calcification with both erosion and mural hemorrhage was clearly shown by a cross-section of atrial wall. Organized and fresh fibrin thrombi were identified at the surface of <b>left</b> <b>atrium.</b> Calcified tissue penetrated into the wall of the <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> and lack of myocardium underneath the massive calcified lesion was evident. Although rheumatic calcification of <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> revealed by medical images was previously described, this is the first case report that demonstrates histopathological evaluation of massive atrial calcification. <Learning objective: Rheumatic calcification of entire <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> after valve replacement surgery is known. Erosive calcification of the atrial wall with mural thrombi was identified by histology in this case. Old renal infarction was revealed by autopsy; therefore calcified atrium could be a source of distal embolism. Transmural calcification penetrated into the left atrial wall. We speculate on the difficulty in finding a cleavage plane for the endoatriectomy of massive calcified atrium in such a situation. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to determine the relationship between <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> remodeling and <b>left</b> ventricle diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients with preserved systolic function. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study on 96 hypertensive patients (48. 75 ± 5. 01 years, 50 men) and 96 healthy control subjects (48. 17 ± 8. 52 years, 56 men), whose data were all evaluated by echocardiography measuring <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> volumes during the reservoir, conduit and pump phases. Standard indices reflecting left ventricular filling were also prossessed. Results: Medium <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> volume indexed for body surface was significantly higher in hypertensive patients – 30. 87 (6. 38) mL/m² vs. 21. 72 (2. 52) mL/m². Indexed <b>left</b> <b>atrium</b> volume was strongly associated with left ventricle diastolic function (p < 0. 0001). When compared to normal subjects, patients with mild diastolic dysfunction had lower corrected passive emptying volumes (p < 0. 0001) and higher corrected active emptying volumes (p = 0. 001), thus leading to similar corrected total emptying volumes (p < 0. 001). However, patients with moderate diastolic dysfunction had smaller active emptying volumes, but higher passive and total emptying volumes when compared to normal controls and patients with mild diastolic dysfunction.
