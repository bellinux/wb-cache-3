40|$|Let S be an {{excellent}} regular scheme and let X be a scheme separated and of finite type over S. Let K_c(X, F_λ) be the Grothendieck ring of F_λ-constructible sheaves on X, where F_λ is the finite field with λ elements. Given an index set I and for certain Q-vector subspaces V⊂∏_i∈ IQ_λ_i, we define wildly <b>compatible</b> <b>systems</b> of virtual constructible sheaves on X. The main result is that for S ≤ 1, wildly <b>compatible</b> <b>systems</b> are preserved by Grothendieck's six operations and Verdier's duality, with further assumption that V is a sub-algebra for derived Hom and tensor product. Finally, when X is a curve over a finite field we prove all ℓ-adic <b>compatible</b> <b>systems</b> will give wildly <b>compatible</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: 16 pages, comments welcomed...|$|R

40|$|Clozel, Harris and Taylor have {{recently}} proved a modularity lifting theorem {{of the following}} general form: if rho is an l-adic representation of the absolute Galois group of a number field for which the residual representation rho-bar comes from a modular form then so does rho. This theorem has numerous hypotheses; a crucial {{one is that the}} image of rho-bar must be "big," a technical condition on subgroups of GL(n). In this paper we investigate this condition in <b>compatible</b> <b>systems.</b> Our main result is that in a sufficiently irreducible <b>compatible</b> <b>system</b> the residual images are big at a density one set of primes.
