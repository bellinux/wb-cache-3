2500|$|Test {{articles}} passing muster {{in vitro}} can be evaluated {{in a number}} of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of bleomycin and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline. Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E

In this mouse occurrence of connective tissue abnormalities in various organs (systemic scleroderma) has been reported. The aim of the present work was to study <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis and deposition in Tsk mice. No differences in the collagen synthesis rate and morphology at the ultrastructural level were found in Tsk mice at birth. At 2 months of age, a marked increase in collagen was observed within the alveolar septa. At this time, an increased <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis, assessed by determining prolyl hydroxylase activity and incorporation of radiolabeled proline, was found in Tsk mice with respect to control mice. However, due to the ongoing parenchymal destruction, the values of total <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> at 6 and 12 months of age were only moderately but significantly increased with respect to those observed at 2 months. As a consequence, a progressive accumulation of <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> fibers was observed in the residual septa.

Although the data in the literature would suggest a genetic cause for the <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> change in Tsk mice, the data presented here indicate that the change in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> metabolism may {{be a part of a}} remodeling process taking place after lung destruction...|$|E

40|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{structural}} protein of the lung. At least five genetically distinct collagen types {{have been identified in}} lung tissue. However, the precise role of collagen in nonrespiratory lung function is not well understood, {{in part because of the}} difficulties inherent in studying <b>lung</b> <b>collagen,</b> regardless of the type of assay used. A major problem is the insolubility of lung collagen; generally less than 20 % of total <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> can be solubilized as intact chains, even with harsh extraction procedures. Since such collagen may not be representative of total <b>lung</b> <b>collagen,</b> errors in quantitating collagen types, for example, may arise from using such material. Measurement of total <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> content may also pose problems, unless appropriate parameters of normalization are chosen.

Despite these difficulties, a number of changes in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> have been documented in experimental pulmonary fibrosis, including increased collagen content, increased collagen synthesis rates, and changes in collagen type ratios. Many questions remain. For example, why do diverse toxic substances appear to cause essentially the same fibrotic response, even though initial sites of damage may vary?

The nonsignificantly higher lung weights relative to the control were attributed to increased adaptive activity and hypertrophy of type II pneumocytes.

40|$|The fetal {{and adult}} lung have a {{constant}} level of collagen synthesis that represents 4 - 5 % {{of the total}} amino acids incorporated into lung protein. Prior {{studies have demonstrated that}} this collagen is not homogeneous but rather is composed of at least two collagen types, I and II, each localized to specific lung structures. Although it is known that explants of rabit lung parenchyma and blood vessels synthesize type I collagen and that rabbit lung tracheobronchial tree synthesizes type II collagen, {{it has been suggested that}} other collagen types are present in lung. It is not known which cells are responsible for the synthesis of any <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> type. To approach the problem of additional <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> heterogeneity and the identification of the cells responsible for <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis, techniques were developed to examine collagen synthesized by lung cells in culture. 10 - 15 % of the proteins synthesized by confluent cultures of rabbit lung cells and fetal human lung fibroblasts are collagen. Separation and purification of this collagen by ion-exchange chromatography and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide mapping techniques indicate that collagen secreted by these cells is composed of two collagen types, I and III. The CNBr peptides of type I collagen secreted by these cells are identical to the CNBr peptides of type I collagen synthesized by lung parenchyma and blood vessels. The peptides of type III collagen secreted by these cells are identical to fetal skin type III collagen CNBr peptides.

Quasi-static P-V measurements were also normal during slow reinflation, even beyond physiological limits to a recoil pressure of 20 cm H 20. However, the lungs of experimental rats ruptured at much lower recoil pressures than controls. Histology was normal in lungs fixed at 20 cm H 20.

This study presents a feasible animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) using nebulized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a non-invasive approach, focusing on its short and long-term effects. Mice received nebulized LPS or vehicle only (control group). Blood, BALF and lung tissue were collected 24 hours (LPS 24 h) or 5 weeks (LPS 5 w) after the nebulized LPS-induced lung injury. Inflammatory cytokines were assessed in the blood serum, BALF and lung tissue. Stereological analyses and remodeling changes were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry at the specified time points. The LPS 24 h group showed increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, intense cell influx, increased total septal volume, septal thickening and decreased surface density of the alveolar septa. The LPS 5 w group showed persistent lung inflammation, septal thickening, increased total <b>lung</b> volume, accentuated <b>collagen</b> deposition, especially of collagen type I, and decreased MMP- 2 protein expression.

Second, we did not demonstrate that the effects of Ang-(1 - 7) are mediated by Mas receptor, since we did not consider a group of animals treated with Mas receptor antagonist (A 779). Ang-(1 - 7) mediates its lung effects through its own receptor and A 779 exacerbates <b>lung</b> injury and <b>collagen</b> deposition [24, 40, 41].|$|R
30|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a {{connective tissue}} disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by diffuse vascular lesions, fibrosis {{of the skin}} and other organs, including the heart, kidneys and <b>lungs.</b> Excess <b>collagen</b> deposition is a characteristic feature of systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis is divided into five forms: diffuse, limited, transitory, systemic scleroderma sine scleroderma and malignant scleroderma. The principal forms are diffuse and limited systemic scleroses [58]. Diffuse systemic sclerosis is characterised by Raynaud phenomenon that precedes the development of skin changes by one year [59]. There is generalised skin fibrosis of the chest and limbs, skin hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation There is early involvement of the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the heart. Limited systemic slcerosis is characterized by sclerotic changes of the hands, feet, face and forearms. There is telangictasia of the skin, cutaneous calcification and late involvement of the lungs with late development of pulmonary hypertension. Diffuse systemic sclerosis occurs equally in males and females. Limited systemic sclerosis has a female predominance. Sytemic scleroderma sine scleroderma is characterised by involvement of the internal organs alone with no external signs [58]. Diastolic dysfunction may occur before any clinical sign or symptom of the disease, in both diffuse and limited forms of the disorder [60, 61].|$|R

40|$|Bleomycin-induced {{pulmonary}} fibrosis in hamsters {{is associated with}} collagen accumulation that results from increased <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis rates. However, 1 - 2 wk after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis rates decline toward control values. To evaluate the potential role of the bronchoalveolar macrophage in regulating <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> production, we studied the effects of macrophages from normal and bleomycin-treated hamsters upon fibroblasts in vitro. We observed: (a) Medium from macrophage cultures decreased fibroblast [3 H]thymidine incorporation and nondialyzable [3 H]hydroxyproline production in a dose-dependent manner. Fibroblast cell counts were decreased in exposed cultures, and fibroblast viability was unchanged. Procollagen prolyl hydroxylation and prolyl-transfer RNA-specific activity were not altered by macrophage medium; this indicates that [3 H]hydroxyproline reflects collagen production rate under the experimental conditions. (b) The suppressive effect of macrophage medium was selective for collagen since collagen production decreased more than noncollagen protein production. (c) Medium from bleomycin-treated hamster macrophages suppressed fibroblast proliferation and collagen production {{to a greater degree}} than medium from normal hamster macrophages. (d) Fibroblast suppression by macrophage medium was associated with increased fibroblast endogenous prostaglandin E 2 production and intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). (e) Incubation of fibroblasts with indomethacin before exposure completely inhibited prostaglandin E 2 production and increases in cAMP, and eliminated suppression of fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. The macrophage-derived suppressive factor has an apparent molecular weight of 20, 000 - 30, 000 and is heat stable. It {{does not appear to be}} species restricted since both hamster and human lung fibroblasts are similarly suppressed. It is at least in part preformed in macrophages obtained by lavage, but its production can also be stimulated in vitro. We concluded that alveolar macrophages release a product that stimulates endogenous fibroblast prostaglandin E 2 production and cAMP formation with resultant suppression of fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. Enhanced release of suppressive factor by macrophages during a time when <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> production is declining in bleomycin-induced {{pulmonary fibrosis}} suggests that macrophages may limit collagen accumulation in pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E

Assessment of total <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> levels in combination with ex vivo micro-computed tomography (µCT) analysis of whole lungs demonstrated that MHV- 68 infection did not enhance <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> deposition in this two-hit model but led to a persistent and exacerbated inflammatory response.

In the past decades, much attention has been paid to the inflammatory cellular process involved in airway remodeling in these two diseases. However, it is increasingly clear that resident cells contribute to airway and lung tissue remodeling and to associated fibrosis as well. This article deals with some new aspects and discusses the role of vasculature and vascular endothelial growth factor in the development of airway obstruction and airway wall fibrosis in asthma and COPD. Moreover, it addresses the extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover as present in both asthma and COPD. All components of <b>lung</b> ECM (<b>collagen,</b> elastic fibers, proteoglycans) have been shown to be potentially altered in these two diseases. Finally, the interaction between transforming growth factor (TGF), Smad signaling, and TGF in the ECM turnover will be discussed. We propose that ECM damage and repair contribute to airway and lung tissue pathology and that the vasculature may enhance this process.

Higher concentrations of salmeterol (10 − 7 and 10 − 6 [*]M) inhibited fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. No effect was observed with cilomilast alone (up to 10 − 5 [*]M). In the presence of 10 − 8 [*]M salmeterol, however, cilomilast could significantly inhibit fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (10 − 7 ~ 10 − 5 [*]M). Blockade of endogenous PGE 2 by indomethacin further potentiated the inhibitory effect of salmeterol on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction, but it did not affect cilomilast's effect. Pretreatment with PGE 2 abolished the inhibitory effect of salmeterol, but it potentiated the inhibitory effect of cilomilast on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. Finally, indomethacin slightly inhibited PDE 4 C expression, while PGE 2 stimulated the expression of PDE 4 A and - 4 C in human lung fibroblasts. These findings suggest that long-acting β-agonist and PDE 4 inhibitor have a synergistic effect in regulating fibroblast tissue repair functions and that PGE 2 can modulate the effect of β-agonist and PDE 4 inhibitor at least in part through the mechanism of regulating PDE 4 expression...|$|R

These data reveal newly identified intricacies for the TGFβ-ALK 5 signalling axis in experimental lung fibrosis, with different outcomes in response to ALK 5 inhibition depending on the presence of viral infection. These findings raise important considerations for the targeting of TGFβ signalling responses in the context of pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Under {{steady state}} {{conditions}} the intracellular pathway {{is the major}} route of collagen catabolism in tissues characterised by rapid collagen turnover. In the <b>lung,</b> the <b>collagen</b> is subject to continuous remodelling and turnover however, the intracellular pathway of collagen degradation is unusual under physiological conditions. The current authors previously described crystalloid inclusions in alveolar macrophages of mice with genetic emphysema {{at the time of}} septal disruption. Using an immunogold technique these inclusions were identified as collagen-derived products and related to intracytoplasmic collagen degradation. To examine whether a different degree of protease burden in lung interstitium may influence the route of intracellular collagen degradation, collagen phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages was studied in various mouse models of emphysema at the time when emphysema develops. Evident collagen by-products in alveolar macrophages were observed in destructive processes characterising spontaneous models of emphysema either with negligible (blotchy mouse) or moderate (pallid mouse) elastase burden. On the other hand, intracellular collagen by-products were appreciated only in a few macrophages from tight-skin mice with high elastolytic burden and could not be observed in mice with a very severe burden after elastase instillation. In conclusion, the interstitial level of proteases burden can affect the way by which the collagen is cleared (intracellularly versus extracellularly) ...|$|R

The {{present study was}} carried out to study the reported protective effect of magnesium chloride on sodium fluoride (NaF) induced alterations in rat <b>lung</b> hydroxyproline/ <b>collagen</b> content. To study the dose response of NaF following groups were studied: (i) normal rats (ii) placebo group, (iii) rats treated with two different doses of NaF. To study the protective effect of MgCl 2 the following groups of rats were studied (i) normal rats (ii) rats injected with MgCl 2 (iii) rats injected with NaF (iv) rats injected with MgCl 2 followed by NaF. Sodium fluoride doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight of rats caused a significant increase (p < 0. 001) increase in peptide -bound and total Hyp content in rat lungs. Administration of MgCl 2 alone to rats also caused significant increase in peptide- bound, protein- bound and total Hyp fractions in rat lungs (p < 0. 001). Administration of MgCl 2 thirty minutes before NaF restored the altered protein bound Hyp fraction to almost normal levels. The present study concludes that although MgCl 2 {{has been reported to}} be protective against toxic effects of NaF, it exerts an independent effect on hydroxyproline and collagen content in rat lungs.

CNTs induce a robust pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress in rodents. Realistic exposures to CNT may occur {{in conjunction with other}} pathogenic impacts (microbial infections) and trigger enhanced responses. We evaluated interactions between pharyngeal aspiration of single walled CNT (SWCNT) and bacterial pulmonary infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with Listeria monocytogenes (LM). Mice were given SWCNT (0, 10 and 40 µg/mouse) and 3 days later exposed to LM (10 3 bacteria/mouse). Sequential exposure to SWCNT/LM amplified <b>lung</b> inflammation and <b>collagen</b> formation. Despite this robust inflammatory response, SWCNT pre-exposure significantly decreased the pulmonary clearance of LM measured 3 - 7 days after microbial infection vs PBS/LM treated mice. Decreased bacterial clearance in SWCNT pre-exposed mice was associated with decreased phagocytosis o...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} collagen breakdown products derived from elastase digestion (CDP) can stimulate "in vivo" <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis. The present work {{deals with the}} morphological and biochemical characteristics of an experimental model of lung fibrosis developed in rabbit by long-term treatment with CDP. Stimulation of collagen synthesis by CDP resulted in a significant thickening of alveolar septa due to accumulation of fibroblasts and a marked deposition of collagen fibrils as revealed by light as well as electron microscopy. Biochemical analysis confirmed the increase in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> deposition. Total collagen content as determined by hydroxy-proline analysis was increased in CDP-treated animals of about 56 % in respect to control animals. A relative increase of type I collagen in respect to type III was also observed. An additional interesting observation was a progressive hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. Unlike other experimental models of lung fibrosis, the collagen deposition in our condition is not preceded or associated with inflammatory or degenerative processes. This fact renders this model very suitable to study matrix-cell interactions in pulmonary fibrogenesi...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} is the pathological {{result of}} {{a diverse group of}} insults. Common features of this group of diseases include chronic inflammation and immune cell activation. The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is not well defined and the prognosis is poor, highlighting the need for good animal models to elucidate the cellular and molecular events that lead to pulmonary fibrosis. This paper provides insight on a newly described model of pulmonary fibrosis using a single intratracheal challenge with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Balb-c and C 57 BL 6 mice given intratracheal FITC develop acute lung injury followed by chronic inflammation. Significant increases in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> content compared to saline-treated mice are noted at day 21 after inoculation. T-cell-deficient animals develop similar increases in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> content compared to immunocompetent controls despite the abrogation of specific anti-FITC serum antibodies. Thus, the induction of fibrosis in FITC-challenged mice is not dependent on T cell immunity. Persistent chronic inflammation and acute lung injury may be the inciting events for the development of lung fibrosis in this model...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In fibrotic {{diseases}} such as pulmonary fibrosis there is evidence suggesting enhanced synthesis and degradation of lung connective tissue components, including collagen. It has therefore been hypothesised that products of collagen degradation may {{have a role in}} the promotion of collagen deposition. In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that intravenous injection of <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> degradation products in experimental animals stimulated collagen synthesis leading to increased collagen deposition and diffuse interstitial lung disease. METHODS [...] Rabbit and human fibroblast cultures from lung and skin were used as an in vitro model to study the responses of these cells to rabbit collagen degradation products. The effects of an acute exposure to collagen degradation products on synthesis of collagen and noncollagenous protein have been studied in confluent cultures by [3 H]-proline incorporation. The effects of collagen degradation products on fibroblast proliferation and production of genetic types of collagen have also been investigated. RESULTS [...] The acute exposure of rabbit lung fibroblast cultures to collagen degradation products significantly increased collagen synthesis without affecting non-collagenous protein synthesis. This effect was dose related, specific for lung fibroblasts, and species specific. Collagen degradation products altered the rate of synthesis of genetic types of collagen with a consequent decrease of type III/I+III collagen ratio (0. 26 (0. 04) treated with collagen degradation products; 0. 45 (0. 02) controls). These effects occurred without the intervention of serum factors. In addition, collagen degradation products neither affected fibroblast proliferation nor selected specific clones emphasising one type of collagen. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that collagen degradation products can influence <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> metabolism by stimulating collagen synthesis. The regulation of collagen mass by collagen degradation products may be of importance in <b>lung</b> <b>collagen</b> homeostasis in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} (BPD) is {{a common}} complication of preterm birth that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. BPD results from life saving interventions such as mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation used to manage preterm infants with acute respiratory failure, which may be complicated by pulmonary infection. The pathogenic pathways driving BPD are not well delineated, but include disturbances to the coordinated action of gene expression, cell cell communication, physical forces, and cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), which together guide normal lung development. Efforts to further delineate these pathways have been assisted {{by the use of}} animal models of BPD which rely on infection, injurious mechanical ventilation, or oxygen supplementation, where histopathological features of BPD can be mimicked. Notable amongst these are perturbations to ECM structures, namely the organization of the elastin and collagen networks in the developing <b>lung.</b> Dysregulated <b>collagen</b> deposition and disturbed elastin fiber organization are pathological hallmarks of clinical and experimental BPD. Strides have been made in understanding the disturbances to ECM production in the developing lung, but much still remains to be discovered about how ECM maturation and turnover are dysregulated in aberrantly developing lungs. This review aims to inform the reader about the state-of-the-art concerning the ECM in BPD, to highlight the gaps in our knowledge and current controversies, and to suggest directions for future work in this exciting and complex area of lung development (patho) biology...|$|R

It is postulated that even small, environmentally relevant concentrations induce changes on lung homeostasis. The present study determined the impact of low-dose single and multiple CBNP (Printex 90) applications on mouse alveolar cell metabolism, especially inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters. Nanoparticles were administered to mice by a single or 8 oropharyngeal aspirations at wk 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12 using 7 g Printex 90, 7 g DQ 12 quartz (positive control), with water vehicle and saline as negative controls. After 2 d or 3 mo lung function was analyzed. Further lung histology, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) parameters, and mRNA expression of cytokines and antioxidants enzymes in type II pneumocytes were measured on d 3 or after 3 mo. Single low-dose Printex 90 application induced no marked alterations in lung functions or BALF phospholipid levels but significant decrease in superoxide dismutase 2 and numerically elevated glutathione peroxidase 3 mRNA expression levels in type II pneumocytes. Multiple CBNP applications produced reduced <b>lung</b> function, <b>collagen</b> accumulation, elevated phospholipid levels in BALF, and a massive infiltration of macrophages. Type II pneumocyte mRNA expression of antioxidative enzymes remained unchanged throughout the subchronic experiment, but showed a significant decrease in interleukin (IL) - 6 R mRNA expression. This study demonstrates that an environmentally relevant CBNP concentration induced an acute inflammatory response, an effect that is exacerbated throughout the subchronic duration...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils {{have been}} {{associated}} with fibrosis. To investigate their direct role in fibrosis, human peripheral blood eosinophil sonicate was added to human lung or dermal fibroblasts, and proliferation ([3 H]thymidine) and collagen synthesis ([3 H]proline) were evaluated. Proliferation was enhanced significantly in the monolayers in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of the eosinophil fibrogenic factor(s) remained unaltered when heated (56 °C, 30 min). Supernatants of cultured eosinophils (20 min or 18 hr) also enhanced lung fibroblast proliferation, indicating that the preformed mitogenic factor(s) can be released both promptly and with a long kinetic. Eosinophils significantly decreased <b>collagen</b> production in <b>lung</b> fibroblasts while increasing it in dermal fibroblasts. However, eosinophils containing matrix metalloproteinase 9 (zymography) in latent form and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (reverse zymography) did not influence either fibroblast matrix metalloproteinases or tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Eosinophil sonicate added to skin and lung fibroblasts in tridimensional collagen lattices significantly enhanced lattice contraction. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a major fibrogenic cytokine produced by eosinophils. Therefore, to assess its role, eosinophil sonicate was preincubated with anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibodies. This treatment partially inhibited proliferation of <b>lung</b> and <b>collagen</b> synthesis of dermal fibroblasts and suppressed the stimulation of lattice contraction, indicating the fibrogenic role of eosinophil-associated TGF-β. In conclusion, we have shown that eosinophils act as direct modulatory cells in fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and lattice contraction, in part, through TGF-β. These data corroborate the importance of eosinophils in skin and lung fibrosis...|$|R
