40|$|I {{am pleased}} to be here today to speak about children’s reading in the {{information}} age and to have this opportunity to think together about the vital role of teachers teaming with school librarians to prepare children to meet the challenges they face in this new environment. <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is a transformational experience in a young child’s life. Of course, children who have been <b>read</b> <b>to</b> from the time they were infants are at a great advantage in <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Reading is not a natural ability that develops with age, like talking and walking. For most children <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> involves a struggle to put letters, sounds and meaning together so that they gradually develop the ability <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Once it is acquired, reading seems so natural that we can easily forget the struggles of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is a crucial step in a child’s education. It provides the requisite skills for <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> Reading opens up the fascinating world of ideas.

5|$|Henry's son, {{also called}} Henry, {{was born at}} the castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry's memoirs, he was better at martial arts than {{academic}} subjects and did not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> until later in life. Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward's Scottish campaign. After {{the outbreak of the}} Hundred Years' War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward’s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.|$|E
5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, {{and there is little}} evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E
