Prevention and remediation of leakage through wells {{plays a crucial role}} in large scale implementation of CO 2 storage. Squeeze cementing is the most common remediation practice in {{the oil and gas industry}} used for various well leakage scenarios. The objective of this work was to test the sealing ability of a commercially available temperature-activated polymer resin in a laboratory-scale squeeze cementing operation. Two well leakage scenarios were selected: micro-annuli or cracks in cement and debonding at cement-casing interface. Cement (with or without steel) core samples with designed vertical <b>leak</b> <b>paths</b> were prepared. Permeability of the samples was measured both before and after the squeeze procedure.

50|$|The closure {{member of}} the valve, plugs are {{connected}} to the stem which is slid or screwed up or down to throttle the flow. Plugs are typically of the balance or unbalanced type. Unbalanced plugs are solid and are used with smaller valves or with low pressure drops across the valve. The advantages are simpler design, with one possible <b>leak</b> <b>path</b> at the seat and usually lower cost. The disadvantages are the limited size; with a large unbalanced plug the forces needed to seat and hold the flow often becomes impractical. Balanced plugs have holes through the plug. Advantages include easier shut off as the plug does not have to overcome static forces. However, a second <b>leak</b> <b>path</b> is created between the plug and the cage, and cost is generally higher.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonic testing (UT) for primary water <b>leak</b> <b>path</b> assessments of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) upper head penetrations. Operating reactors have experienced leakage when stress corrosion cracking of nickel-based alloy penetrations allowed primary water into the annulus of the interference fit between the penetration and the low-alloy steel RPV head. In this investigation, UT <b>leak</b> <b>path</b> data were acquired for an Alloy 600 control rod drive mechanism nozzle penetration, referred to as Nozzle 63, which was removed from the North Anna Unit 2 reactor when the RPV head was replaced in 2002. In-service inspection prior to the head replacement indicated that Nozzle 63 had a probable leakage path through the interference fit region. Nozzle 63 was examined using a phased-array UT probe with a 5. 0 -MHz, eight-element annular array. Immersion data were acquired from the nozzle inner diameter surface. The UT data were interpreted by comparing to responses measured on a mockup penetration with known features. Following acquisition of the UT data, Nozzle 63 was destructively examined to determine if the features identified in the UT examination, including leakage paths and crystalline boric acid deposits, could be visually confirmed.

In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced.

This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a <b>leak</b> <b>path</b> throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the load and stab flanks. This clearance may cause a connection to leak through the thread helix when available thread compound cannot heal this <b>leak</b> <b>path.</b> Despite undesirable effects on the sealability and rigidness of this joint, such a clearance is required to decrease frictional forces during make-up while maintaining the desired radial interference...|$|E

Although a static analysis is able to find all potential leaks in a program, it often reports {{a great number of}} false warnings. Manually validating these warnings is a daunting task, which significantly limits the practicality of the analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic technique that automatically validates and categorizes such warnings to unleash the power of static memory leak detectors. Our technique analyzes each warning that contains information regarding the leaking allocation site and the <b>leaking</b> <b>path,</b> generates test cases to cover the <b>leaking</b> <b>path,</b> and tracks objects created by the leaking allocation site. Eventually, warnings are classified into four categories: MUST-LEAK, LIKELY-NOT-LEAK, BLOAT, and MAY-LEAK. Warnings in MUST-LEAK are guaranteed by our analysis to be true leaks. Warnings in LIKELY-NOT-LEAK are highly likely to be false warnings. Although we cannot provide any formal guarantee that they are not leaks, we have high confidence that this is the case. Warnings in BLOAT are also not likely to be leaks but they should be fixed to improve performance.
