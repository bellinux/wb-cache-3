It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and <b>lambs</b> <b>for</b> <b>rearing</b> and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for calves for fattening and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, lambs for fattening are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves for fattening or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves for fattening significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves for fattening and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening. Conclusions on {{the efficacy of the}} product for sheep would derive from results with lambs for fattening which were not made available...|$|E
40|$|It was {{evaluated}} {{the performance and}} the carcass characteristics of 36 non-castrated male lambs, Santa Inês purebreed and crossbreeds from Dorper × Santa Inês and Texel × Santa Inês, managed in three different systems (intensive, semi-intensive and extensive), slaughtered at 38. 41 ± 1. 24 kg. It was observed the highest weight gain <b>for</b> <b>lambs</b> <b>reared</b> in intensive system, which also showed the greatest carcass yield. The management systems did not influence carcass measures of animals in intensive system much because of the greater weight of the carcass. The intensive system provided the best performance, regardless the genetic group. The use of Texel and Dorper breeds in crossings with Santa Inês increases carcass yield...|$|R

Livestock Science, 165, 181 - 188 Paper submitted 9 - 8 - 13 The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the body weights, body condition scores, survival and litter weights of lamb produced by pure Welsh Mountain ewes with those of crossbred Cheviot, Lleyn, Poll Dorset and Texel ewes in a hill environment. Ewes were mated to Suffolk rams and recorded over the first 3 seasons of production. Between lambing and weaning, ewes rearing single lambs grazed semi-natural hill swards (1. 5 ?ewes/ha) and those rearing twins grazed improved enclosures (10 ?ewes/ha). Crossbreeding significantly (P< 0. 001) increased body weights at all ages, with values for four-year old ewes of 45. 9, 57. 2, 51. 6, 57. 8 and 58. 5 ?kg in purebred Welsh Mountain and Cheviot, Lleyn, Poll Dorset and Texel crossbred ewes respectively. Individual lamb growth rates from birth to 8 weeks and from 8 weeks to weaning were significantly higher in the progeny of crossbred ewes (P< 0. 001) with highest growth rates <b>for</b> <b>lambs</b> <b>reared</b> by Poll Dorset and Texel cross ewes. Individual lamb weaning weights were 27. 0, 29. 4, 29. 2, 30. 4 and 30. 7 ?kg <b>for</b> <b>lambs</b> <b>reared</b> by purebred Welsh Mountain and Cheviot, Lleyn, Poll Dorset and Texel crossbred ewes respectively. Survival rates to third mating were 0. 73, 0. 77, 0. 83, 0. 72 and 0. 75 (P< 0. 05), litter size reared was 1. 22, 1. 33, 1. 49, 1. 43 and 1. 25 (P< 0. 001) and litter weights at weaning were 37. 1, 43. 5, 46. 1, 46. 5 and 44. 2 (P< 0. 001) for purebred Welsh Mountain and Cheviot, Lleyn, Poll Dorset and Texel crossbred ewes respectively. Efficiency expressed as kg litter weight/kg ewe pre-tupping weight 0. 75 ?was significantly improved (P< 0. 001) by crossbreeding. Total litter weight at weaning over three lamb crops per ewe entering the flock was increased from 78. 4 ?kg in purebred Welsh Mountain ewes to between 97. 1 ?kg in Cheviot and 109. 7 ?kg in Lleyn crossbred ewes. It is concluded that where feed resources are adequate, the retention of crossbred ewes in the hill flock can give significant improvements in productivity. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Soon after {{parturition}} {{a lasting}} and mutual ewe–lamb bond is established. However, in {{an increasing number}} of intensive sheep farms, lambs are separated from the dam at an early age. When artificial rearing is applied lambs are often kept with mothers for 2 days to allow the ingestion of maternal colostrum and then abruptly removed from their dams. Thus, lambs experience a marked emotional stress represented by the loss of the most relevant social model at this early stage of their behavioural development and a nutritional stress represented by the transition from maternal milk to a commercial milk substitute. These animals when exposed to open field tests show reduced levels of vocalization, are slower to initiate movements, spend less time in ambulatory behaviour and display an increased cortisol response than non-separated animals. In addition, artificial rearing performed on lambs from 2 days of age onward can cause decreased cellular and humoral immune responses. The main oral abnormal behaviour performed by artificially reared lambs is represented by sucking the navel or the scrotum of pen mates. This activity is evident from the initial days on reconstituted milk and lasts until weaning from milk. Attempts have been made to reduce the detrimental effects of early separation. Some of them mainly focus on the emotional aspects (it is recommended not to leave a <b>lamb</b> alone <b>for</b> artificial <b>rearing),</b> others aim at reducing the nutritional impact of artificial rearing (milk intake can be increased by offering a mix of ewe milk and a milk replacer during the first week and then gradually moved to a diet based only on milk substitute which results in higher growth rates). As compared with artificial rearing, early weaning performed at 3 months of age is associated with a later disruption of the mother–young bond and the consequent direct replacement of maternal milk by solid food. However, when they are given the chance, ewes and their lambs form long-term social associations which exceed the age of natural weaning, regarded {{as the end of the}} milk feeding period. Early weaned lambs emit an increased number of high pitched bleats immediately after weaning than before and this increment is still evident 2 days afterwards. Neither partial nor gradual separation from mothers is able to reduce the stress associated with early weaning. In conclusion, premature separation from mothers has clear and marked detrimental effects on various functions in <b>lambs.</b> <b>For</b> <b>lambs</b> maternal deprivation seems to be worse at 2 days (artificial rearing) than at 3 months of age (early weaning) ...|$|R
