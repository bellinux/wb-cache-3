5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind <b>limbs,</b> <b>and</b> browsing for higher foliage.

A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E

5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E

Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears.

5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E
5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of a frog {{normally}} starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. After further growth, during which it develops <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E

5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short <b>limbs,</b> <b>and</b> long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, <b>limbs,</b> <b>and</b> specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|One popular {{hypothesis}} {{suggested that}} pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. Nevertheless, {{there is some}} dispute as to whether pinnipeds are {{more closely related to}} bears or musteloids, as some studies support the former theory and others the latter. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, Puijila had a long tail, short <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its <b>limbs</b> <b>and</b> shoulders were more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium (traditionally considered a mustelid) and Enaliarctos. Of the three, Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of Puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.|$|E
