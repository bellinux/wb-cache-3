500|$|Radiohead did {{not support}} The King of Limbs with live {{performances}} until several months after its release, as Yorke wanted to continue studio work, and {{it took some time}} to arrange the album for live performance. They enlisted drummer Clive Deamer, best known for his work with Portishead and Get the Blessing, to help perform the complex rhythms. Selway said of the two-drummer setup: [...] "That was fascinating. One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> at play, really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{perform the}} rhythmically complex King of Limbs {{material}} live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, {{who had worked}} with Portishead and Get the Blessing; Selway said of the collaboration: [...] "One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> at play, really interesting." [...] With Deamer, Radiohead recorded a second From the Basement session, released online as [...] in August 2011. It was also broadcast by international BBC channels and released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2012. The performance included two new songs, [...] "The Daily Mail" [...] and [...] "Staircase", released as a double A-side download single on 19 December 2011. Deamer has joined Radiohead on subsequent tours.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Legacy said the album was, [...] " [...] pretty much like the lifestyle {{and the culture of}} the typical California teenager put in music. It’s going to surprise a lot of people, {{because a lot of people}} think we just make the jerk songs [...] dance music." [...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was quick to point out that most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'. Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown, local producers. Legacy said, [...] "We have no big producers on our album. All of our producers are <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> ...|$|E

500|$|Connelly {{contributed to}} four tracks, {{including}} [...] "Blame", which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group Tower of Power. [...] Nicole Blackman, KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals {{to the track}} [...] "Dogma", which was adapted from the ten-minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. [...] "Power", meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, Wax Trax!, for a radio promo song. [...] Konietzko said he'd heard [...] "radio didn't like big female choruses", so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson {{to help with the}} song, which he called [...] "dumb and catchy". [...] The hidden track of the album, [...] "Fairy", is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. [...] Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's [...] "dirty fantasies". [...] He also said it was not a serious track: [...] "it was more <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> at play". [...] For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano.|$|E
500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes that}} {{featured}} Rachel's party were acclaimed by most reviewers. Fallon called them [...] "a parade {{of the funniest}} sight gags, most uninhibited acting, and—interestingly enough—most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while", and described Michele as [...] "an acting stand out" [...] who [...] "handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne". His colleague Meghan Brown said it [...] "showed Glee at its best", and added: [...] "The dialogue was snappy, the group dynamic was clean and specific, and the kids seemed like actual kids." [...] VanDerWerff {{also pointed out that}} the club members [...] "really felt <b>like</b> <b>kids,</b> not like miniature 30-somethings", and said the party was the [...] "best part" [...] of the episode. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn's breakdown of [...] "the five drunk girl archetypes, as demonstrated by the glee girls". Harper wrote that the party scenes [...] "left a lot to be desired", and Patrick Burns, the third reviewer from The Atlantic, [...] "waited for the Glee party to get out of control, or for someone to get hurt so that America's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking", but [...] "the worst thing that happened was that Rachel tried to flip a gay guy".|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, RISK {{had started}} putting his {{graffiti}} on canvases and co-founded Third Rail, {{a series of}} gallery shows.

2500|$|The Williams {{family moved}} from Compton, California, to West Palm Beach, Florida, {{when she was}} ten, so that Venus and Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who took notice of the sisters and who would provide {{additional}} coaching. He did not always agree with Williams's father but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters <b>like</b> <b>kids,</b> allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since {{he wanted them to}} take it slow and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments. At that time, Venus Williams held a 63–0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1among the under-12 players in Southern California. In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home.|$|E
2500|$|Wanrong's {{younger brother}} Rong Qi remembered how Puyi and Wanrong, both teenagers, loved to race their {{bicycles}} through the Forbidden City, forcing eunuchs {{to get out}} of the way, and told Behr in an interview: [...] "There was a lot of laughter, she and Puyi seemed to get on well, they were <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> together." [...] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi's two surviving eunuchs, an 85year-old man who proved reluctant to answer the questions asked of him, but finally stated about Puyi's relationship with Wanrong: [...] "The Emperor would come over to the nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ... He leave early in the morning on the following day and for the rest of that day he would invariably be in a very filthy temper indeed." [...] Reginald Johnston arranged for the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun, a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, to visit Puyi in the Forbidden City in September1924, which was the first time the heirs of both the deposed Ming and Qing dynasties came face to face.|$|E
2500|$|After huge {{losses in}} the team roster and point guard shortage, Lithuania started the tournament with a loss to Turkey (76–84). This {{was the first time}} in the 21st century that the Lithuanians began a {{championship}} with a defeat. Later Lithuanians disappointingly lost to Poland, and depended on a strong fourth quarter [...] to beat Bulgaria. Finishing third in its group, Lithuania qualified for the second round. However, it already begun badly with a 23-point loss to Slovenia. Following this shocking loss, team's captain Robertas Javtokas, when asked about the team's future, said: [...] "I don't know what else we could promise. We must get straight or it is enough of promises. We must come as men with balls and not <b>like</b> <b>kids.</b> Otherwise, other teams will humiliate us again". The team's game still not improved, with a defeat to Spain (70–84) diminishing the Lithuanians' chances to qualify for the quarter-finals, and a loss to Serbia eliminating the team outright, with the final standing being a measly 12th place. Coach Ramūnas Butautas took all responsibility for the fiasco and resigned. It is regarded as the worst Lithuania national team performance ever.|$|E

5000|$|The Australian press {{contained}} positive reviews [...] of genre-hopping {{style of}} the band and their live show. In 2006 Des Peres released its second album, Ace Doubt (Flict/MGM) which has moved even further from the electronic sounds and has moved further down the sample heavy sounds similar to artists <b>like</b> <b>Kid</b> Koala, DJ Shadow and RJD2.|$|R
50|$|Howard McGhee {{was raised}} in Detroit, Michigan. During his career, he played in bands led by Lionel Hampton, Andy Kirk, Count Basie and Charlie Barnet.

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Burleson, Clarkson {{was encouraged by}} her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series [...] in May 2002. Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were <b>like</b> <b>kids</b> in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK but America {{is a very different}} market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress." [...] Clarkson {{went on to win the}} competition on September 4, 2002 at the then Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini and without being sent into the bottom three throughout the season.|$|E

Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters <b>like</b> <b>kids,</b> allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: [...] "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us." ...|$|E
