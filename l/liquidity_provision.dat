40|$|The second European banking {{directive}} of 1989 allows national banking {{markets to}} become more concentrated over the last decennia and allows banks {{to do more than}} just lending. These conditions form the perfect basis to investigate the effect of bank characteristics on firms' external financing and growth. Additionally, we assess the impact of the current financial crisis. The aim of the first two chapters is to examine the relationship between more concentrated banking markets and external finance behavior of firms. The first paper examines firm capital structure. Results show that more concentrated banking markets are associated with less external capital which suggest that banks use their market power. In the second paper we investigate loan characteristics such as size, maturity and spread of syndicated loans. In the syndicated loan market, more concentrated banking markets lead to lower loan spreads. However, during the financial crisis we find that more concentrated banking markets cause an increase in loan spreads which aggravates the effect of the financial crisis. In the third chapter, we examine the relationship between banks as shareholder and the performance of firms in which banks own shares. Banks are expected to be more able to control management, because they can lend to firms as well as being a shareholder. Nevertheless, we find bank ownership to reduce firm value. This result contrasts sharply with the hypothesis that banks are good monitors. It suggests that banks should focus on their core activities. Finally, we investigate the impact of bank regulation on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisioning</b> of banks to firms. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>provisioning</b> is one of the primary reasons for banks to exist. Moreover, the banking sector is one of the most regulated industries in the world, where bank capital plays a prominent role. Our results show that stronger supervision of bank capital results in lower <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisioning.</b> Yet, during the financial crisis stronger supervision of bank capital stimulates <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisioning...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how {{international}} money markets reflected {{credit and}} liquidity risks during {{the global financial}} crisis. After matching the currency denomination, we investigate how the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) denominated in the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Regardless of the currency denomination, TIBOR was highly synchronized with LIBOR in tranquil periods. However, the interbank rates showed substantial deviations in turbulent periods. We find remarkable asymmetric responses in reflecting market-specific and currency-specific risks during the crisis. The regression results suggest that counter-party credit risk increased the difference across the markets, while liquidity risk caused the difference across the currency denominations. They also {{support the view that}} a shortage of US dollar as liquidity distorted the international money markets during the crisis. We find that coordinated central bank <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisions</b> were useful in reducing liquidity risk in the US dollar transactions.

Extraordinary <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as the Term Auction Facility by the Federal Reserve, are analyzed. First a decomposition of the Libor-OIS spread indicates that credit premia increased in importance as the crisis deepened. Second, using Markov switching models, central bank operations are then graphically associated with reductions in term funding stress. Finally, bivariate VAR and GARCH models are adopted to econometrically quantified these impacts. While helpful in compressing Libor spreads, the economic magnitudes of central interventions have overall not been very large.

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency.

40|$|In {{response}} to the current global crisis, the U. S. Federal Reserve and other central banks {{around the world have}} implemented diverse policy measures, including purchasing a wide range of securities, lending to financial institutions, intervening in foreign exchange markets, and paying interest on reserves. Some central banks have also reduced monetary policy interest rates to minimum levels (reaching a lower bound) and have announced an explicit commitment to keep interest rates there for a prolonged period. This set of instruments contrasts with a conventional view—embedded in the predominant monetary policy models—in which a central bank controls only a short-term interest rate, such as the Federal Funds rate. Some of the previous actions may be classified as responses to increasing demand for liquidity in a context of enormous financial uncertainty. Examples of this <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisioning</b> by central banks are the repurchase operations initiated in many economies to provide U. S. dollar liquidity during the period surrounding the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Other actions may be sorted into those attempting to deal with malfunctioning financial markets (insufficient lending to nonfinancial firms or high lending spreads) and those attempting to enhance the monetary policy stimulus under the lower-bound constraint [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{experimental}} {{setting in which}} investors can entrust their money to traders, we investigate how compensation schemes affect <b>liquidity</b> <b>provision</b> and asset prices. Investors face a trade-off between risk and return. At {{the benefit of a}} potentially higher return, they can entrust their money to a trader. However this investment is risky, as the trader might not be trustworthy. Alternatively, they can opt for a safe but low return. We study how subjects solve this trade-off when traders are either liable for losses or not, and when their bonuses are either capped or not. Limited liability introduces a conflict of interest because it makes traders value the asset more than investors. To limit losses, investors should thus restrict <b>liquidity</b> <b>provision</b> to force traders to trade at a lower price. By contrast, bonus caps make traders value the asset less than investors. This should encourage <b>liquidity</b> <b>provision</b> and decrease prices. In contrast to these predictions, we find that under limited liability investors contribute to asset price bubbles by increasing <b>liquidity</b> <b>provision</b> and that caps fail to tame bubbles.

First, the estimation results of the Japanese government bond yield curve using the Black-Gorovoi-Linetsky (BGL) model show that (1) the shadow interest rate has been negative since the late 1990 s, turned upward in 2003, and has been on an uptrend since then, and (2) the first-hitting time until the negative shadow interest rate hits zero again under the risk-neutral probability {{is estimated to be}} about three months as of the end of February 2006. Second, under the ZIRP and QMEP, the risk premiums for Japanese banks have almost disappeared in short-term money markets such as the market for negotiable certificates of deposit, while they have remained in the credit default swap market and the stock market. This result supports the view that market participants have positively perceived the BOJfs ample <b>liquidity</b> <b>provisions</b> in containing the near- term defaults of banks caused by the liquidity shortage.
