Ink transfer was less reduced on laser print than electromechnaical when printed without electrostatic assist. Print mottle was significantly lower and yellow, magenta and black <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> images, while cyan print from <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> cylinder had higher mottle on some substrates (SCB, SCA and freesheet).

40|$|According to the {{previous}} study, the printability of electromechanical <b>engraved</b> cylinder and <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> cylinder were different in terms of density, tone reproduction and mottle. In this study, the missing dots of two different engraved cell types were investigated. It showed that different cell structures had strong effect to ink transferring and the characteristics of missing dots. <b>Lasers</b> <b>engraved</b> cells were less affected by ESA (electrostatic assist). When there was no ESA applied, the <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> cells showed less missing dot area, which indicated better ink release from spherical shaped cells. ESA had more effects to coated substrates than supercalendered substrates...|$|R

25|$|Traditional engraving, by burin or {{with the}} use of machines, {{continues}} to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as photoengraving and <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.|$|E

2500|$|Keytops are an {{important}} element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a [...] "dish shape" [...] on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and <b>laser</b> <b>engraving,</b> both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.|$|E
50|$|At {{one time}} {{jewellers}} {{who attempted to}} do <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> did need to use large pieces of equipment. Now the devices that perform <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> come in units. Some entrepreneurs have placed such units in mall kiosks. That has made <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> jewellery much more accessible. The makers of machines for <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> jewellers have developed some very specialized equipment. They have designed machines that can engrave {{the inside of a}} ring. They have also created machines that have the ability to engrave the back of a watch.|$|E

Bakelite {{is said to}} be easily laser-engraved; some hard engineering plastics work well. Expanded plastics, foams and vinyls however are generally candidates for routing rather than <b>laser</b> <b>engraving.</b> Plastics with a chlorine content (such as vinyl, PVC) produce corrosive chlorine gas when lasered, which combines with Hydrogen in the air to produce vaporized hydrochloric acid which can damage a <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> system.
