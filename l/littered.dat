40|$|Aims We {{explored}} the decomposition rates of single- and mixed-species <b>litter,</b> the litter-mixing effect {{and the effect}} of component <b>litters</b> in a mixture on decomposition. Methods In a <b>litter</b> bag experiment, shoot <b>litters</b> from two dominant grasses (Leymus chinensis and Stipa baicalensis) and one legume (Melissitus ruthenica) were decomposed separately and as a mixture from May 2010 to September 2011 in the Hulun Buir meadow steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. We separated the <b>litter</b> mixture into its individual component <b>litters</b> (i. e. the different single-species <b>litters)</b> and analyzed the changes in <b>litter</b> mass remaining and <b>litter</b> nitrogen (N) remaining during single-and mixed-species <b>litter</b> decomposition. Important Findings (i) <b>Litter</b> mixing had significant positive effects on <b>litter</b> decomposition. The litter-mixing effect was strongest for the mixture of S. baicalensis and L. chinensis <b>litters,</b> followed by the mixture of S. baicalensis and M. ruthenica <b>litters.</b> (ii) Single-species component <b>litters</b> decomposed faster in the mixtures than separately (positive effect), but these effects were not significant for legume species M. ruthenica <b>litter.</b> Relative to single-species <b>litter</b> decomposition, the decomposition rates of the two grass (S. baicalensis and L. chinensis) <b>litters</b> significantly increased when they were mixed with each other or with M. ruthenica <b>litter.</b> (iii) For each species <b>litter</b> type, the percentage of <b>litter</b> N remaining during decomposition (NR) differed between the single-species <b>litter</b> and mixed <b>litter</b> treatments. The NR of S. baicalensis <b>litter</b> was higher when it was decomposed in the mixture than in isolation. However, the NR of L. chinensis <b>litter</b> was lowest in its mixture with M. ruthenica among the treatments. Regardless of its decomposition in the mixture or in isolation, the NR of M. ruthenica <b>litter</b> varied little among treatments. There was a significant positive relationship between the NR and percentage of initial <b>litter</b> mass remaining in both the single <b>litter</b> and mixed <b>litter</b> treatments. These results suggest that N transfer may happen among component <b>litters</b> in mixture and further affect the decomposition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the laboratory, {{different}} types of <b>litter</b> samples (constructed v. intact) {{can be used in}} flammability experiments but the sampling method of these <b>litters</b> could affect <b>litter</b> flammability results. To assess this effect, samples of <b>litters</b> were collected in South-eastern France, according to two different methods previously used in other studies, one keeping intact the structure of the <b>litter</b> layers (non-constructed <b>litter)</b> and the other requiring the construction of the <b>litter,</b> using mainly the surface <b>litter</b> layer (constructed <b>litter).</b> The comparison of flammability results showed that the sampling method had a significant effect on <b>litter</b> bulk-density, rate of spread and rate of consumption, intact <b>litter</b> being more flammable than reconstructed <b>litter</b> that was artificially compacted. The type of vegetation had a significant effect on <b>litter</b> depth, ignitability, sustainability, consumability and combustibility (except on rate of spread) and the <b>litter</b> composition could explain in part this fire behaviour. The effect of the construction of <b>litters</b> on flammability parameters and its magnitude also differed according to vegetation types.

This experiment studied functional redundancy of microarthropods in a <b>litter</b> decomposition system by interchanging mesofauna among three different <b>litter</b> types. The study hypothesized that total micro- arthropod densities would be lower in foreign <b>litter</b> type than in original (‘home’) litter; and <b>litter</b> with foreign mesofauna would decompose slower than with native one. Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) <b>litter</b> were stored in microcosms with original microbiota. Microarthropods from the same (‘home’) or different (‘foreign’) type of <b>litter</b> were inoculated to microcosms. <b>Litter</b> mass loss and total density of collembolans, oribatid and other mites were recorded {{at the end of}} incubation (3 and 12 months). <b>Litter</b> quality determined total density of microarthropods irrespective of the origin of animals. <b>Litter</b> mass loss values differed in the three <b>litter</b> types. For pine <b>litter,</b> the origin of microarthropods had significant effects on <b>litter</b> mass loss. In oak <b>litter,</b> mainly microarthropod density influenced decomposition.

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight on behavior and heart rate variability (HRV) of piglets under stress. Methods Forty four original <b>litters</b> were categorized as high <b>litter</b> weight (HW) <b>litters</b> (n = 22) and low <b>litter</b> weight (LW) <b>litters</b> (n = 22) by 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight. From each original HW <b>litter,</b> three males and three females were randomly selected after weaning and the 12 piglets from two original <b>litters</b> with similar age of days were regrouped into one new high <b>litter</b> weight (NHW) <b>litter</b> (11 NHW <b>litters</b> in total). The original LW <b>litters</b> were treated with a same program, so that there were 11 new low <b>litter</b> weight (NLW) <b>litters</b> as well. The latencies to first fighting, fighting frequencies and duration within three hours were recorded after regrouping and the lesions on body surface within 48 hours were scored. Besides, HR (heart rate, bpm, beats per minute) and activity count (ACT), time domain indexes and frequency domain indexes of the piglets were measured in an isolation trial to analyze the discrepancy in coping with stress between the original HW and LW <b>litters.</b> Results The results exhibited that piglets from the HW <b>litters</b> launched fighting sooner and got statistically higher skin lesion score than those from the LW <b>litters</b> (p = 0. 03 and 0. 02, respectively). Regarding the HRV detection, compared with the HW <b>litters,</b> the LW <b>litters</b> exhibited a lower mean HR (p< 0. 05). In the isolation test, a highly significant higher ACT value was observed between the HW <b>litters,</b> compared to the LW <b>litters</b> (p< 0. 01). Significant differences were observed in standard deviation of R-R intervals, standard deviation of all normal to normal intervals, and most frequency-domain indicators: very low-frequency, low-frequency, and high frequency between the HW and LW <b>litters</b> as well. The difference in LF:HF was not significant (p = 0. 779). Conclusion This study suggests that compared with <b>litters</b> of low 20 -day <b>litter</b> weights, <b>litters</b> with higher 20 -day <b>litter</b> weight take more positive strategies to cope with stress and have stronger HRV regulation capacity; HW <b>litters</b> demonstrate better anti-stress and adaptation capacity in the case of regrouping and isolation...|$|R

Two <b>litter</b> decomposition experiments were also performed using freeze-damaged <b>litter</b> and non-damaged <b>litter</b> in a loblolly pine forest. The freeze event in November 2009 caused a pronounced pulse of needle <b>litter</b> fall. The freeze-damaged needle <b>litter</b> was shown to have higher N concentration and lower C/N ratio compared with the normal falling needle <b>litter.</b> This finding indicates that freeze damage significantly increased needle quality because of incomplete nutrient resorption.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of leaf <b>litter</b> into fecal pellets by saprophagous macroarthropods {{has long been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in <b>litter</b> decomposition by altering microbial processes. However, conflicting results are reported in the literature, and it is currently not clear to what extent varying initial <b>litter</b> quality contributes to distinct microbial responses to the {{transformation of}} <b>litter</b> into feces. Here we performed a screening test using a wide range of distinct leaf <b>litter</b> from 26 tree species. We fed these <b>litters</b> to the macroarthropod species i during one week under controlled conditions, and compared microbial responses in uningested leaf <b>litter</b> with that of feces produced from the 26 different leaf <b>litter</b> types. We assessed substrate induced respiration (SIR) as an integrative measure of microbial responses. We found that <b>litter</b> SIR was highly variable across species and well related to initial <b>litter</b> quality. However, variability in feces SIR was strongly reduced and only weakly related to initial <b>litter</b> quality. Moreover, the difference between feces and <b>litter</b> SIR decreased with increasing <b>litter</b> SIR as a result of higher microbial stimulation in <b>litter</b> with low associated <b>litter</b> SIR. Our data clearly showed that the direction and magnitude of microbial stimulation in feces depend strongly on the <b>litter</b> type. Therefore, the consequence of <b>litter</b> transformation into macroarthropod fecal pellets for microbial decomposers and possibly for subsequent decomposition of feces is specific to <b>litter</b> species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbandoned {{lands are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to establish}} fast-growing tree plantations, and are often rapidly colonized by a high density of herbaceous undergrowth. These weeds are generally removed since they compete with trees for resources, in particular soil nutrients. However, mixing herbaceous <b>litter</b> with the <b>litter</b> of planted trees could also stimulate the activity of decomposers and associated nutrient release due to an increase of <b>litter</b> quality (lower C:N ratio), plant diversity (more diverse <b>litter</b> traits) and water holding capacity. The objective {{was to determine the}} impact of herbaceous <b>litter</b> on the <b>litter</b> decomposition process of white spruce and hybrid poplar <b>litters</b> alone or in mixtures. <b>Litter</b> mass loss rate, nutrient release and decomposer communities were monitored on single and mixed-species <b>litters</b> using litterbags during two years in three plantations types (hybrid poplar, white spruce and mixed plantations). <b>Litters</b> within mixtures were separated by species to identify species-specific responses of leaf mass loss. N release of all <b>litter</b> types increased with the presence of herbaceous <b>litter.</b> This finding could be linked to the greater abundance of decomposers and fungal biomass brought about by the herbaceous <b>litter.</b> Addition of herbaceous <b>litter</b> had no effect on spruce <b>litter</b> mass loss but had positive effects on poplar and mixed spruce/poplar <b>litter</b> mass loss. Abundance of fungi and mites was more affected by <b>litter</b> quality, whereas the abundance of collembola was more affected by the diversity of resources than by <b>litter</b> quality.

Six <b>litter</b> treatments (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 ×natural <b>litter</b> mass and complete <b>litter</b> removal) were established in November 2004 and the soil and <b>litter</b> communities sampled in October 2005. Species composition of oribatids was distinct for the soil and <b>litter.</b> There was no apparent effect of increasing <b>litter</b> mass on the soil mite assemblage. In the <b>litter</b> layer, the number of oribatids g− 1 of <b>litter</b> showed a strong negative relationship with increasing <b>litter</b> mass whilst the number of mesostigmatids g− 1 of <b>litter</b> was unresponsive to <b>litter</b> mass. Hence, the relative abundance of these two groups altered with increasing <b>litter</b> mass. The response of the oribatid groups Oppiidae and Poronota followed this negative relationship with <b>litter</b> mass but Phthiracaridae appeared less affected. Consequently, there was a subtle shift in the relative abundance of these groups with increasing <b>litter</b> mass. Our results demonstrate that oribatids as a whole and within groups respond in a predictable manner to increases in <b>litter</b> mass whilst mesostigmatids are unresponsive. Whilst there are undoubtedly biological and physical aspects that vary with <b>litter</b> mass, <b>litter</b> mass itself, is able to explain some patterns in the assemblage of oribatid mites. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{decomposition}} {{rates of}} plant <b>litter</b> mixtures often deviate from the averaged rates of monocultures of their component <b>litter</b> species. The mechanisms behind these non-additive effects in decomposition of <b>litter</b> mixtures are lively debated. One plausible explanation for non-additive effects {{is given by}} the improved microenvironmental condition (IMC) theory. According to this theory, plant <b>litter</b> species, whose physical characteristics improve the microclimatic conditions for decomposers, will promote the decomposition of their co-occurring <b>litter</b> species. We tested the IMC theory in relation to leaf <b>litter</b> and soil moisture in two contrasting moisture conditions in a dry subarctic mountain birch forest with vascular plant leaf <b>litters</b> of poor and high quality. The non-additive effects in mass loss of <b>litter</b> mixtures increased when moisture conditions in <b>litter</b> and soil became more favourable for plant <b>litter</b> decomposition. The sign of this increase (antagonistic or synergistic) in non-additive effects was more predictable for <b>litter</b> mixtures of poor <b>litter</b> quality. Although the specific mechanisms underlying the IMC theory depended on the <b>litter</b> quality of the <b>litter</b> mixtures, a standardized water holding capacity (WHC) was the <b>litter</b> trait most {{closely related to the}} non-additive effects in mixtures of both poor and high quality <b>litter</b> types. Furthermore, we found that higher dissimilarity in WHC traits between the component <b>litter</b> species in a mixture increased synergistic effects in <b>litter</b> mixtures under limiting moisture conditions. However, under improved moisture conditions, increased antagonistic effects were observed. Thus, we found clear support for the IMC theory and showed that climatic conditions and leaf <b>litter</b> physical traits determine whether the non-additive effects in <b>litter</b> mixtures are antagonistic or synergistic. Our study emphasizes the need to include <b>litter</b> physical traits into predictive models of mixing effects on plant <b>litter</b> decomposition and in general suggests climate specificity into these models. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|<b>Litter</b> {{decomposition}} is {{a fundamental}} ecosystem process in which breakdown and decay of plant detritus releases carbon and nutrients. Invasive exotic plants may produce <b>litter</b> that differs from native plant <b>litter</b> in quality and quantity. Such differences may impact <b>litter</b> decomposition and soil respiration in ways that depend on whether exotic and native plant <b>litters</b> decompose in mixtures. However, few field experiments have examined how exotic plants affect soil respiration via <b>litter</b> decomposition. Here, we conducted an in situ study of <b>litter</b> decomposition of an annual native grass (Eragrostis pilosa), a perennial exotic forb (Alternanthera philoxeroides), and their mixtures in an annual grassland in China to examine potential invasion effects on soil respiration. Alternanthera <b>litter</b> decomposed faster than Eragrostis <b>litter</b> when each was incubated separately. Mass loss in <b>litter</b> mixes was more rapid than predicted from rates in single species bags (only 35 % of predicted mass remained at 8 months) showing synergistic effects. Notably, exotic plant <b>litter</b> decomposition rate was unchanged but native plant <b>litter</b> decomposition rate was accelerated in mixtures (decay constant k = 0. 20 month- 1) compared to in isolation (k = 0. 10 month- 1). On average, every <b>litter</b> type increased soil respiration compared to bare soil from which <b>litter</b> was removed. However, the increases were larger for mixed <b>litter</b> (1. 82 times) than for Alternanthera <b>litter</b> (1. 58 times) or Eragrostis <b>litter</b> (1. 30 times). Carbon released as CO 2 relative to <b>litter</b> carbon input was also higher for mixed <b>litter</b> (3. 34) than for Alternathera <b>litter</b> (2. 29) or Eragrostis <b>litter</b> (1. 19). Our results indicated that exotic Alternanthera produces rapidly decomposing <b>litter</b> which also accelerates the decomposition of native plant <b>litter</b> in <b>litter</b> mixtures and enhances soil respiration rates.

Marcel Fässler took over the No. 7 Audi entry from Lotterer and abandoned his first attempt because his vehicle's rear-end became excessively light and later lost downforce behind two cars in Blanchimont corner which restricted the car to starting sixth. The two Rebellion Racing cars and the No. 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers. Qualifying was stopped for ten minutes when the ByKolles car collided with the No. 43 Manor entry at La Source and debris coming from the former's rear bodywork <b>littered</b> the track at Radallion corner.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were <b>littered</b> with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Leaf <b>litter</b> {{decomposes}} on {{the surface}} of soil in natural systems and element transfers between <b>litter</b> and soil are commonly found. However, how <b>litter</b> and soil organic matter (SOM) interact to influence decomposition rate and nitrogen (N) release remains unclear. Leaf <b>litter</b> and mineral soil of top 0 - 5 cm from six forests were incubated separately, or together with <b>litter</b> on soil surface at 25 A degrees C for 346 days. <b>Litter</b> N remaining and soil respiration rate were repeatedly measured during incubation. <b>Litter</b> carbon (C) and mass losses and mineral N concentrations in <b>litter</b> and soil were measured at the end of incubation. Net N transfer from soil to <b>litter</b> was found in all <b>litters</b> when incubated with soil. <b>Litter</b> incubated with soil lost more C than <b>litter</b> incubated alone after 346 days. For <b>litters</b> with initial C: N ratios lower than 52, net N-min after 346 days was 100 % higher when incubated with soil than when incubated alone. <b>Litter</b> net N-min rate was negatively related to initial C: N ratio when incubated with soil but not when incubated alone. Soil respiration rate and net N-min rate did not differ between soil incubated with <b>litter</b> and soil incubated alone. We conclude that soils may enhance <b>litter</b> decomposition rate by net N transfer from soil to <b>litter.</b> Our results together with studies on <b>litter</b> mixture decomposition suggest that net N transfer between decomposing organic matter with different N status may be common and may significantly influence decomposition and N release. The low net N-min rate during <b>litter</b> decomposition along with the small size of <b>litter</b> N pool compared to soil N pool suggest that SOM rather than decomposing <b>litter</b> is the major contributor to plant mineral N supply...|$|R
30|$|<b>Litter</b> {{collection}} {{started in}} September 2014 at site A and September 2015 at site B. In 2014 and 2015, <b>litter</b> was collected from September 1 to November 31, {{which is the}} main leaf shedding season. In 2016, <b>litter</b> was collected throughout the year. <b>Litter</b> traps were emptied once per month. In 2014 (the first year), we separated <b>litter</b> into leaf <b>litter</b> and non-leaf fractions (fine branches ≤ 2.5 [*]cm in diameter, bark, reproductive structures, animal detritus, and other unidentified fine <b>litter).</b> However, only about 5 % of the total was in the non-leaf fraction and we therefore stopped separating <b>litter</b> thereafter. <b>Litter</b> amounts were very low in February and June 2016, and we therefore collected the <b>litter</b> together with the one trapped in the following month. All <b>litter</b> samples were weighed after oven-drying at 60 [*]°C for 48 [*]h.|$|R
40|$|Global {{changes such as}} {{increasing}} CO 2, rising temperature, and land-use change are likely to drive shifts in <b>litter</b> inputs to forest floors, but the effects of such changes on <b>litter</b> decomposition remain largely unknown. We initiated a <b>litter</b> manipulation experiment to test the response of <b>litter</b> decomposition to <b>litter</b> removal/addition in three successional forests in southern China, namely masson pine forest (MPF), mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MEBF). Results showed that <b>litter</b> removal decreased <b>litter</b> decomposition rates by 27 %, 10 % and 8 % and <b>litter</b> addition increased <b>litter</b> decomposition rates by 55 %, 36 % and 14 % in MEBF, MF and MPF, respectively. The magnitudes of changes in <b>litter</b> decomposition were more significant in MEBF forest and less significant in MF, but not significant in MPF. Our results suggest that change in <b>litter</b> quantity can affect <b>litter</b> decomposition, and this impact may become stronger with forest succession in tropical forest ecosystem...|$|R
