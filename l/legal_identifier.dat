50|$|The Federal Communications Commission {{assigned}} the call letters WSTT to this station on May 23, 1983 until they requested a switch to WCWI on March 15, 1987. This call sign was short-lived as the station would switch calls again on September 13, 1987 to become WIYC. Almost a decade would elapse before the station changed, this time becoming WVPI on February 3, 1997. The station used this <b>legal</b> <b>identifier</b> {{for more than}} five years until switching to the current call sign, WZIN, on December 10, 2002.|$|E
5000|$|The main method {{must accept}} {{an array of}} [...] objects. By convention, it is {{referenced}} as [...] although any other <b>legal</b> <b>identifier</b> name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use variable arguments, {{in the form of}} , allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of [...] arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (the [...] parameter is still an array of [...] objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifier</b> (or LEI), is a 20-character {{identifier}} {{that identifies}} distinct legal entities that engage in financial transactions. It {{is defined by}} ISO 17442. The LEI is a global standard, designed to be non-proprietary data that is freely accessible to all. Over 435,000 legal entities from more than 195 countries have now been issued with LEIs.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{frequency}} of spelling and typographical errors in practical applications, record linkage algorithms have to use string similarity functions. In many <b>legal</b> contexts, <b>identifiers</b> such as names have to be encrypted before a record linkage can be attempted. Therefore, algorithms for computing string similarity functions with encrypted identifiers are essential for approximating string matching in private record linkage. This study reports an empirical evaluation of three promising approaches to compute similarities between identifiers in a privacy preserving manner...|$|R

In addition, NSD is a pre-Local Operating Unit (pre-LOU). Pre-LEI codes assigned by NSD are published {{on the web site}} of the Global <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifier</b> Foundation authorized by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) to maintain the global LEI database, and are globally accepted by regulators, market participants, and pre-LOUs of other countries.|$|R

40|$|Financial {{entities}} {{are often}} referred to with ambiguous descriptions and identifiers. To tackle this issue, the Financial Entity Identification and Information Integration (FEIII) Challenge requires participants to automatically reconcile financial entities among three datasets: the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council (FFIEC), the <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifiers</b> (LEI) and the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our approach {{is based on the}} combination of different Naive Bayes classifiers through an ensemble approach. The evaluation on the Gold Standard developed by the challenge organizers shows F 1 -scores that are above the average of the other participants for the two proposed tasks...|$|R
50|$|EMIR {{requires}} that all entities entering into derivative contracts must submit reports to their corresponding trade repositories, outlining each over-the-counter trade. These mandatory reports must {{also include a}} Unique Transaction <b>Identifier</b> (UTI), <b>legal</b> entity <b>identifier</b> (LEI), information on the trading capacity of the counterparty, and the marked-to-market valuation of the position. The counterparty data in a report includes 26 fields for data and the common data includes 59 fields of data. These fields include an LEI, or a unique 20 digit alphanumeric code {{that may be used}} for eight of the 26 counterparty data fields, and the unique trade identifier, which are generated based on the report's LEI.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{financial}} stability implications of covered bonds. Banks issue covered bonds by encumbering assets on their balance sheet and placing them within a dynamic ring fence. As more assets are encumbered, jittery unsecured creditors may run, {{leading to a}} banking crisis. We provide conditions for such a crisis to occur. We examine how different over-the-counter market network structures influence the liquidity of secured funding markets and crisis dynamics. We draw on the framework to consider several policy measures aimed at mitigating systemic risk, including caps on asset encumbrance, global <b>legal</b> entity <b>identifiers,</b> and swaps of good for bad collateral by central banks...|$|R
40|$|The {{passage of}} the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act sparked {{discussion}} of creating a systematic code that uniquely identifies an entity. This code is {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>legal</b> entity <b>identifier</b> (LEI). The information that is collected to accompany and describe the LEI will {{play an important role in}} enhancing the usefulness of the LEI. This paper explores the information (referred to as reference data) commonly used in datasets that describe entities and evaluates the usefulness of reference data elements for uniquely identifying an entity and for monitoring systemic risk in the financial industry.

5000|$|The November 2014 G-20 {{summit in}} Brisbane, Australia, {{demonstrated}} that the chances are slim for schemes to make any additional multinational companies' tax information public. Thus any proposals more ambitious than the OECD's BEPS appear impractical for now, like the Global <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifier</b> (LEI) for financial markets that was established after recommendations by the international Financial Stability Board and on which the G-20 has been working since 2012, or Gabriel Zucman's idea for a world financial registry. Zucman gave the keynote address at the two-day event on [...] "Human Rights and Tax in an Unequal World" [...] at NYU's CHRGJ from September 22 to 23, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The AIFMD's {{reporting}} regulations require each AIF to {{be named}} using a series of codes, including its national identification code, the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and the <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifier</b> code. AIFMs must select only brokers and counterparties that are subject to regulatory supervision, that are financially sound, and that have the necessary organizational structure to provide services to the AIFM or the AIF. All AIFMs must submit quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reports to their respective member state regulator with information about the AIFM and its AIFs {{as well as an}} annual report with information such as the fund's financial statements, activities, and information about the total amount of remuneration paid by the AIFM to its staff.|$|R
50|$|The prefix {{portion of}} the UTI code should be a unique code for the code issueing authority. Ideally, the prefix would have reused the <b>Legal</b> Entity <b>Identifier</b> (LEI) of the entity issueing the UTI. LEI codes are used across the {{financial}} reporting regimes in the U.S. (Dodd-Frank) and Europe (EMIR / MiFID). However, the LEI code length of 20 characters represented a problem for many systems, which in practice limited the usable prefix length to 10 characters. In June 2013, ISDA working groups suggested that the characters 7 through 16 of the 20 character global LEI number should {{be used as the}} UTI prefix. This would have led to clashes between UTIs generated for different organisations having the same characters 7 through 16 in their LEIs. Now the recommended best practice entails a 10 character UTI Prefix, algorithmically derived from an entity’s 20 character LEI using hash algorithms.|$|R
5000|$|Widgets {{created by}} FLUID are [...] "named", [...] "complex named", or [...] "unnamed". A named widget has a <b>legal</b> C++ {{variable}} <b>identifier</b> {{as its name}} (i.e. only alphanumeric and underscore), and is defined by a global variable or class member that will point at the widget after the function defining it is called. A complex named object has punctuation such as '.' or '->' or any other symbols in its name. In this case, FLUID assigns a pointer to the widget to the name, but does not attempt to declare it. This {{can be used to}} get the widgets into structures. An unnamed widget has a blank name and no pointer is stored.|$|R
