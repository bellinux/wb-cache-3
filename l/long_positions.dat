25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, private equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control. Finally, private equity firms only take <b>long</b> <b>positions,</b> for short selling is not possible in this asset class.|$|E
2500|$|A {{market maker}} in {{corporate}} bonds is constantly trading bonds when clients {{want to buy}} or sell. [...] This can create substantial bond positions. [...] The largest risk is that interest rates overall move. [...] The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> in corporate bonds. [...] In this way, the risk that remains is credit risk of the corporate bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the market}} opens {{on the first}} day of trading a new futures contract, there is a {{specification}} but no actual contracts exist. Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are [...] "created" [...] whenever Open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also [...] "destroyed" [...] in the opposite manner whenever Open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> or rebuy to reduce their short positions.|$|E

30|$|The buy {{signal to}} enter a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> (or to cover a prior short position) is {{generated}} when the RSI is in an oversold territory (RSI <  30). On the other hand, the sell signal {{to enter a}} short position (or to close a prior <b>long</b> <b>position)</b> is generated when the RSI is in an overbought territory (RSI >  70).|$|R
30|$|When the {{relative}} {{performance of the}} short position is better {{than that of the}} <b>long</b> <b>position,</b> this strategy is going to be profitable regardless of stock market regimes. So, a speculator who pairs a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in a retail stock with a short position in a rival stock or an index ETF could end up with a profit. Pairs trading could be viewed alternatively as a mechanism to hedge both sector and market risks. When there is a financial crisis, two stocks both decline in value; but then the pair trade would result to a gain on the short position and an offsetting loss on the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> This will yield a profit close to zero in spite of the large market movement. It is clear that this is a self-funding strategy as short sale proceeds may be utilised in creating the <b>long</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The role {{of large}} numbers of {{individual}} speculators willing to take both short and <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> without prejudice, [...] does play some role in preventing price bubbles and asset inflation. [...] However, excess speculation is often deemed not only a source of volatility but a distraction of talent and dangerous shift of focus for a developed economy. [...] By contrast, hedging is necessary for the stability of enterprises. [...] Tax schemes in general seek to tax speculation - seen as akin to gambling - while trying not to interfere with hedging (a form of insurance). [...] A brief summary of the differences is that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Following GJR's {{results and}} {{mounting}} empirical evidence of EMH anomalies, academics {{began to move}} away from the CAPM towards risk factor models such as the Fama-French 3 factor model. It should be noted that these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory (whereas CAPM is founded on Modern Portfolio Theory), but rather, constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical EMH anomalies. For instance, the [...] "small-minus-big" [...] (SMB) factor in the FF3 factor model is simply a portfolio that holds <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> on small stocks and short positions on large stocks to mimic the risks small stocks face. These risk factors are said to represent some aspect or dimension of undiversifiable systematic risk which should be compensated with higher expected returns. Additional popular risk factors include the [...] "HML" [...] value factor (Fama and French, 1993); [...] "MOM" [...] momentum factor (Carhart, 1997); [...] "ILLIQ" [...] liquidity factors (Amihud et al. 2002).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} quarter of 2008, Greenlight lost 15% of its value, {{primarily}} from <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> on industrial companies like Helix Energy Solutions, when the SEC temporarily banned short selling of financial stocks. With the majority of Greenlight's money in bonds and <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> on stocks, this stopped hedge funds minimizing 'long' losses or offsetting them with short gains. Greenlight ended 2008 down 23%, its first annual loss. [...] In 2009 Greenlight recouped its losses from 2008.|$|E
30|$|The buy {{signal to}} enter a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> (or to cover a prior short position) is {{generated}} when the MACD crosses above its own Signal Line (Bullish signal).

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new financial product named Bonus Certificates PLUS and we provide detailed descriptions of the product specifications. We show that the payoff of a Bonus Certificates PLUS can be duplicated by {{the combination of a}} <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in the underlying asset, a short posi-tion on zero coupon bonds, a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in down-and-out call options on the underlying asset, a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in down-and-in call options on the underlying asset, and a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> in the down-and-out put options. We develop a pricing formula to price the certificates. A sample of ten Bonus Certificates PLUS outstanding on December 2007 is presented as an example to examine how well the model fits empirical data. The profitability in the primary market is examined and the results show that issuing Bonus Certificates PLUS is a profitable business. The results are in line with pre-vious studies pricing other structured products. Finally, we simulate and present the sensitivities of the certificates to changes in different pricing inputs...|$|R

50|$|The {{strategy}} holds long/short equity positions, with <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> hedged {{with short}} {{positions in the}} same and related sectors, so that the equity-market-neutral investor should be little affected by sector-wide events. This places, in essence, a bet that the <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> will outperform their sectors (or the short positions will under perform) regardless {{of the strength of}} the sectors. Equity-market-neutral strategy occupies a distinct place in the hedge fund landscape by exhibiting one of the lowest correlations with other alternative strategies.|$|E

50|$|The term {{synthetic}} CDO arises {{because the}} cash {{flows from the}} premiums (via the component CDS in the portfolio) are analogous to the cash flows arising from mortgage or other obligations that are aggregated and paid to regular CDO buyers. In other words, taking the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> on a synthetic CDO (i.e., receiving regular premium payments) is like taking the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> on a normal CDO (i.e., receiving regular interest payments on mortgage bonds or credit card bonds contained within the CDO).|$|R

If the interest rate on the trader's short position is higher than the rate on the <b>long</b> <b>position,</b> then the trader pays the interest.
