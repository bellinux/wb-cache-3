50|$|As {{these cells}} {{traverse}} an ATM network, switching takes place {{by changing the}} VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent {{from one end of}} the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit is consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others). ATM switches use the VPI/VCI fields to identify the virtual channel link (VCL) of the next network that a cell needs to transit on its way to its final destination. The function of the VCI is similar to that of the data link connection identifier (DLCI) in frame relay and the <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> and logical channel group number in X.25.|$|E
5000|$|Each digital OTA {{channel number}} is {{composed}} of a main number and a subchannel, for example 4.1, 4.2, etc. A dash is an alternate form of representation: 4-1, 4-2... The dot and dash are interchangeable; they both mean the same thing. The main channel numbers refer to the same radio frequencies as previously. However, now [...] "virtual channel" [...] (technically known as <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number)</b> numbers are common. So, Channel 4 digital signals may now actually be broadcast on channel 43, or any other frequency. When the ATSC tuner does a channel scan, it finds the signal on channel 43, learns that this material is called [...] "Channel 4", and remembers that mapping. The user can tune to [...] "4", and the tuner will know to tune in 43. Before a scan is done, {{it may be possible}} to access the programs directly by manual tuning, by entering 43-1, 43-2... After the scan, the programs would usually be accessed by entering 4-1, 4-2 etc., but it may still be possible to also access them directly at 43. If stations change their broadcast frequencies, {{it may be possible to}} access the new frequencies directly, but the usual procedure is to rescan all of the channels.|$|E

The complaint added that the channel listed itself at multiple locations across various genres in the electronic program guide of various MSOs and other distributors on multiple <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>numbers</b> (LCNs), which it said violated the TRAI rules, which mandates every channel to declare its genre to it and every distributor to assign a unique <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> to each such channel. Subsequently, the TRAI ruled in favour of NBA issuing a mandate against use of multiple LCNs.|$|R
50|$|DigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at {{the same}} time. The primary {{difference}} between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only packet identifier 8187 for its master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream {{with the concept of}} a virtual <b>channel</b> <b>number,</b> whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate program numbers from those used in other transport streams. There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual <b>channel</b> remapping using <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>numbers.</b> Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MAC layer, a {{radio link}} control (RLC) layer and a {{broadcast}} and multicast control (BMC) layer exist in a second layer. The MAC layer maps various <b>logical</b> <b>channels</b> to various transport <b>channels</b> and performs <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> multiplexing to map a plurality of <b>logical</b> <b>channels</b> to one transport channel. The MAC layer {{is connected to the}} RLC layer, which is a higher layer, through a <b>logical</b> <b>channel.</b> The <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> is divided into a control channel for transmitting information on a control plane and a traffic channel for transmitting information on a user plane, according to the kind of transmitted information. ...|$|R
5000|$|One DTE-DCE {{interface}} to an X.25 {{network has}} {{a maximum of}} 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits, although networks {{are not expected to}} support a full 4095 virtual circuits. For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> and a 4-bit logical channel group number. [...] Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit {{for the duration of the}} connection. [...] Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. [...] (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All International networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. [...] DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel. [...] Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call. [...] The logical channel identifier of zero is used for packets which don't relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).|$|E
40|$|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the {{underlying}} transport mechanism for future high-speed communication {{networks in the}} local area {{as well as in}} the wide area. ATM is a packet-oriented transport technique based on short packets of fixed size called cells. ATM networks are connection-oriented by definition. A virtual connection has to be set up before any data can be transferred across the network. During the connection setup phase, a path is selected by the network that all cells of the connection will follow. On each link along this path, a <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> is assigned to the connection and carried in the cell header. Cells of many connections can be multiplexed onto the same physical transmission link using the asynchronous time division (ATD) multiplexing scheme. Cells are switched using translation tables associating each incoming <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> with an outgoing port and a new <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>number.</b> Although the tables are controlled by software, it is mandatory to implement the actual cell transport in hardware using dedicated high-speed switching fabrics. A plethora of different architectures for ATM switching networks have been proposed in the literature. One of the objectives of this thesis is to provide a systematic description of ATM switch fabrics by identifiying a common set of key characteristics defining each architecture. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the performance evaluation and comparison of major characteristics affecting switch performance. (orig.)

40|$|This Operational Practice {{specifies}} {{the operational}} parameters {{for use of}} the logical_channel_descriptor for Australian free-to-air Digital Terrestrial Television transmissions and assigns the allocation of Logical Channel Numbers (LCNs) to be used to identify television and radio services carried on free-to-air DVB-T transmissions 1. This Operational Practice also makes recommendations to receiver manufacturers and broadcasters to cover situations where receivers find repeated LCNs in reception overlap areas with varied reception quality or where there is no LCN. The informative Appendix A gives some background and suggested scenarios on how LCNs are used in Australia. The logical_channel_descriptor specifications are in compliance with the detail in the Australian Digital TV Transmission standard, AS 4599 [1]. The Australian specification, while based on the original development of the Logical Channel Descriptor 2 by the UK DTG [2], has variations and extensions in its implementation similar to its use in Europe, such as the NorDig specification 3. 2. APPLICATION The intention of the Logical Channel Descriptor is to provide a broadcaster assigned virtual channel number or label, for each of the services available to the DTTB receiver. These services are defined by the "DVB triple " a combination of the original_network_id, transport_stream_id and service_id, whose values are allocated according to Free TV Operational Practice OP- 40 [3]. Logical Channel Numbers (LCNs) are used in Australia to identify services, some of which may not be present at all times. Each individual DTTB service is allocated a <b>Logical</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Number</b> by the broadcaster in accordance with the allocation table in this Operational Practice.
