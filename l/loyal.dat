25|$|On 23 January in {{the final}} act of the battle, the 2nd <b>Loyals,</b> {{covering}} the last men of Anderson's column {{to make it into}} British lines, had two companies positioned as rear guard facing the defile on the road to Yong Peng. At 14:00, as they were about to withdraw, seven Japanese tanks supported by an estimated two battalions of infantry emerged rapidly from the defile and attempted to dismantle the <b>Loyal's</b> road block. In the short battle that followed the 2nd <b>Loyals</b> inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese infantry attempting to dismantle the road block but ultimately the <b>Loyals,</b> without any anti-tank weapons, were driven off by the tanks and out numbered by the Japanese infantry. During the Battle of Muar and as the rear guard the 2nd <b>Loyals</b> suffered an estimated 200 casualties before withdrawing to Singapore.|$|R
50|$|The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 {{introduced}} a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble {{in their own}} brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training. The Volunteer Battalions of the <b>Loyals</b> {{were assigned to the}} Mersey Brigade, which was later split up and the <b>Loyals</b> reassigned to the Northern Counties Brigade based in Preston. In 1902 this was also split, the <b>Loyals</b> staying with the new North East Lancashire Brigade based in Preston. Finally, in 1906 the brigade was entitled the North Lancashire Brigade and two battalions of the King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) were brigaded with the <b>Loyals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1938, {{as part of}} the {{modernisation}} of the army, the 55th {{was converted}} into a motor division and 164th Bde was disbanded. The 5th <b>Loyals</b> was converted into a divisional motorcycle battalion. When the TA was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis, 5th <b>Loyals</b> spun off a duplicate battalion. While some regiments followed the First World War practice and used '1/' and '2/' prefixes, the <b>Loyals</b> designated the new unit the 6th Battalion, re-using the number of a Kitchener's Army battalion of 1914-18.|$|R

25|$|The 8th Bn <b>Loyals</b> {{was formed}} on 4 July 1940 at Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, {{as a new}} unit. (A {{previous}} 8th <b>Loyals</b> had been a 'Kitchener's Army' battalion during World War I). The majority of the recruits were from Lancashire, particularly Liverpool, the officers from regiments in North West England (the commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel J.

50|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the 5th and 6th <b>Loyals</b> mobilised at Derby Barracks, Bolton, as motorcycle battalions in 55th Division. However, from 15 September the division's duplicate units, including 6th <b>Loyals,</b> were formed into the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. Neither of these divisions joined the British Expeditionary Force in France, and were still training in the UK when the Battle of France broke out. 5th <b>Loyals</b> had just been transferred to a new 20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards) on 24 April 1940 but was left behind when the brigade was hurriedly sent to the Defence of Boulogne on 22 May 1940.|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{associations}} {{to brand}} attributes are a core part of Consumer Based Brand Equity (CBBE), and behavioural loyalty (buying frequency or share of wallet) {{is a key}} outcome ofCBBE. In this research, we test {{of the relationship between}} past behavioural loyalty and current brand associations. We draw on data where past purchases tracked for a year and brand associations from the same individuals. The results show that both buying frequency and share of wallet have positive relationships with brand associations. The exception was that, the results for 100 % <b>loyals</b> were mixed. 100 % <b>loyals</b> for smaller brands have a lower propensity to associate the brand with the attribute than those with a lower share of wallet. We also found that 100 % <b>loyals</b> were more likely to associate the brand with more attributes than non- 1 00 % <b>loyals</b> at the same buying frequency. This suggests that share of wallet is a greater driver of brand association responses than buying frequency. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} quiet sectors during the German Spring Offensive, but the 5th <b>Loyals</b> were moved about frequently on different pioneer tasks, suffering {{a trickle of}} casualties as a result. Once the Allied Hundred Days Offensive was under way, the pioneers were distributed by companies to follow closely behind the advancing troops and improve the roads in the forward area. On 27 September the 57th Division forced {{the line of the}} Canal du Nord. 170th Brigade's attack was led by the pioneers of the 5th <b>Loyals,</b> with two companies of 2/4th <b>Loyals</b> in support for mopping-up and then defending the captured ground. On 9 October the 5th <b>Loyals</b> were among the first troops to liberate the town of Cambrai. Again, they were among the first British troops to enter Lille, and afterwards the battalion provided a Guard of honour for President Georges Clemenceau when he visited the city on 16 October. The battalion was at Tournai when the Armistice with Germany was signed.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} British Army regiments, the <b>Loyals</b> {{accumulated}} {{a number of}} traditional observances during their existence. The first to happen each year was {{the celebration of the}} regiment's defence of Kimberley during the Boer War. Annually, the regiment would celebrate this battle honour on 15 February. The next anniversary on the calendar commemorated the victory at the Battle of Maida, where the 1st Battalion of the 81st Regiment, won the battle honour carried by the <b>Loyals.</b> Annually, the regiment commemorated the battle with a parade and dinner in the mess. Annually on 13 September, the <b>Loyals</b> commemorated Quebec Day. This celebrated the 47th Regiment's participation in the capture of Quebec under General Wolfe. Men of the 1st Battalion of the <b>Loyals,</b> successors to the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, were eligible to become members of the Wolfe Society. The anniversary was marked by a trooping of the colours while the regimental band played the 47th Regiment's slow march followed by Quebec. On New Year's Eve, the Sergeants' Mess of the <b>Loyals</b> would hold a ball in celebration of Tarifa Day. The ball commemorated the defense of Tarifa by the 47th Regiment in 1811 against a determined assault by the French army.|$|R

Finally, just before the third sunset when the protection spells around their three <b>loyals</b> fade, which will allow Queen Loranella to finally kill them, the three familiars arrive. Upon arrival, they realize that their real enemy is the Queen Loranella's familiar, a hare named Paksahara, who had imprisoned the real queen, and shifted into her likeliness. They also become aware that murdering Kalstaff and kidnapping their <b>loyals</b> was also really done by Paksahara under the guise of Queen Loranella. As the three familiars make desperate endeavors to rescue their <b>loyals,</b> Aldwyn discovers that he is in fact magical and possesses the power of telekinesis. With his newfound power, Aldwyn and his fellow familiars defeat Paksahara, who ultimately escapes.
