5|$|Pearson began 1979 {{by winning}} the pole {{position}} at year's first race at Riverside; he finished in second place. 1979 was Pearson's final season racing for the Wood Brothers, with his last race happening at Darlington. After a miscommunication, he left the pits without waiting for the pit crew to place <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on {{the car and the}} tires fell off the car when he reached the end of pit lane. Pearson quit the team after the race. Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers. Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury. Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500. For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points. Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.|$|E
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. <b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|The GTO {{underwent}} a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered tail lights were replaced with eight tail lights, four on each side. Rally II wheels with colored <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> were {{also available in}} 1967. The GTO emblems located on the rear part of the fenders were moved to the chrome rocker panels. Also the grill was changed from a purely split grill, to one that shared some chrome.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was seven months {{pregnant}} and had her 10-month-old daughter beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered to tighten the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
25|$|In the Sprint Cup Series, Earnhardt hit {{a slight}} resurgence, {{and in the}} first five races of the season {{recorded}} three Top 5's and five Top 10 finishes. It began with a second-place finish to teammate Jimmie Johnson at the Daytona 500, Earnhardt's third runner up finish in the 500 since 2010. The following week at Phoenix, he led for 47 laps, but was shuffled back in traffic during a cycle caution flag pit stops, which allowed Carl Edwards to assume the lead while Junior finished in fifth place. This was followed by two more Top 10 finishes: 7th at Las Vegas and 6th at Bristol. At Fontana, Earnhardt started mid-pack and after a couple of mistakes including a lengthy pit stop caused by missed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on a right rear tire, he came home in 2nd-place finish, assuming the points lead as a result of Brad Keselowski going off pace and falling back. Two weeks later in Martinsville, Earnhardt struggled throughout the race, and spun out after Danica Patrick was hit by Brian Vickers and sent into Earnhardt and ended up finishing 24th, 2 laps down, losing the points lead to Jimmie Johnson.|$|E

25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{model year}} {{marked the first}} time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of the Twilight Zone episode [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", after having a {{nightmare}} {{in which he is}} killed in a bus crash, Bart rides the bus to school one rainy morning. He panics when he sees a gremlin {{on the side of the}} bus loosening the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on one of the wheels. Bart unsuccessfully tries to convince the other passengers of the danger. In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an emergency flare. The gremlin catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned, who decides to adopt the creature. When the bus finally stops, everyone sees the obvious damage, but Bart is still sent away to an insane asylum for the rest of his life for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but the gremlin appears in the back window of the ambulance, holding Flanders' decapitated (yet still living) head, which makes Bart scream in terror.|$|E

2500|$|Only a {{few changes}} {{were made to the}} 1978 VAM Gremlin. The {{dashboard}} design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the [...] "Gremlin X" [...] logo on the rear quarter panel. The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.|$|E
2500|$|The Budd Company {{kept the}} only {{prototype}} model, but later renamed it [...] "XR-Budd" [...] {{and used it}} for marketing purposes. The Rambler lettering on {{the rear of the}} trunk lid was removed, while the stamped steel wheels with full wheel covers were upgraded to chrome-plated reverse wheels with exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> Budd sold the prototype to The Henry Ford Museum in 1997. It is now at the museum and also displayed at major classic car shows.|$|E
2500|$|The GT variant {{gained a}} bigger V8, the [...] Canadian-made Windsor engine, {{producing}} [...] equipped with dual exhausts and sports air cleaner. The styling of the GT went wilder {{with the addition}} of an offset racing-style bonnet scoop, bonnet locks, and blackouts, as well as 'Super Roo' stripes along the full length of the car (these and the bonnet blackouts were a 'delete option'). GT wheels were now 12-slot steel with flat centre caps over the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> and stainless steel dress rims. The twin 'driving lights' introduced on the XT GT were carried over to the XW GT.|$|E
50|$|Screw-in studs simply screw {{into the}} {{existing}} threaded bolt {{hole in the}} hub. The end that screws into the hub is usually either threaded with a higher tolerance fit or installed with a chemical thread-locking fluid {{to keep it from}} backing out from the hub when the <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> is removed.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 13. Denny Hamlin made an unscheduled stop a lap {{later for}} a loose wheel, {{which was a}} result of having only one <b>lug</b> <b>nut.</b> Fortuitous for him, caution #2 flew two laps later when D. J. Kennington spun out moments after blowing his engine in Turn 4.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 20. Coming to the line, Trevor Bayne {{edged out}} Elliott {{to win the}} first segment. Brian Scott was tagged for a <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> violation and Cole Whitt was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon. Both restarted the race from the tail-end of the field.|$|R
2500|$|The Series 3 (1984–1985) {{featured}} {{an updated}} lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster. GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a fuel-injected 1.3L 13B RE-EGI engine producing 135hp (101kW) and [...] GSL-SEs had {{much the same}} options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external oil cooler was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial [...] "beehive" [...] water-oil heat exchanger.|$|E
2500|$|Pedal {{spindles}} {{are hard}} steel, and gradually fret and erode the crankarm {{where the two}} meet. [...] This can eventually be a cause of crank breakage, which commonly occurs at the pedal eye. [...] Some manufacturers advise {{the use of a}} thin steel washer between the pedal and crank, but this is ineffective because the hard washer frets against the crank instead. [...] A solution, suggested by Jobst Brandt, is to use a 45 degree taper at the surface where crank and pedal meet, as this would eliminate precession-induced fretting and loosening (it is already done for most automobile <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for the latter reason). [...] However, this would require manufacturers to change a well-established standard which currently allows most pedals to be fitted to most cranks.|$|E
2500|$|The 1979 VAM Pacer {{was exactly}} as the 1978 model {{in terms of}} appearance, with the {{exceptions}} of the previously standard wheel covers and a new hood bright molding with front ornament. All VAM Pacers were featured VAM's inhouse five-spoke wheels with trim rings and chrome volcano hubcaps with exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> New seat designs with a horizontally stripped pattern and Barcelona crests on the headrests as a luxury touch (the same ones used in the AMC Matador Barcelona models), a new steering wheel design with a soft rectangular center button, all-new door panels designs in plastic and vinyl with a rigid top pull strap and sliding locks with woodgrain accents. The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM started using {{for the first time}} the net rating system for measuring the output of its engines. This meant that the 1979 VAM [...] six-cylinder engine was now rated at [...] at 3900 rpm. The electrical system was revised with a new fuse box located under the dashboard on the driver's side. A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold.|$|E
50|$|This was AR's {{take on the}} 4-lug, 8-spoke British Minilite wheel {{for sports}} cars. The main {{difference}} was that one side of each spoke was relieved near the hub for <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> clearance. with {{the other side of}} each spoke continuing to the hub circle. These were cast in magnesium for racing and in aluminum alloy for street use.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013: During {{his final}} pit stop, Jimmie Johnson took on four tires when a <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> broke loose. His stop lasted 17.4 seconds. Ryan Newman pitted a lap later. Aware of Johnson's struggles, Newman elected {{to take on}} only two tires. Newman emerged with a 7-second lead over Johnson with 16 laps to go. Johnson closed to within 2 seconds, but fell short as Newman held on for the victory.|$|R
25|$|Despite these changes, the Z8 {{remained}} extremely {{faithful to}} the concept car. The side-mounted turn indicators were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were preserved {{through the use of}} an expensive MIG-welded aluminum space frame. The Z8 even retained the concept's five-spoke wheel design, albeit without the race-style center <b>lug</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Concord-based VAM American {{started as}} the [...] "second generation" [...] {{of the economy}} and luxury line of {{intermediate}} VAM compacts, the first generation being the 1975-1977 Hornet-based Americans. The 1978 base models were called [...] "American sedan" [...] and [...] "Camioneta American" [...] by VAM, despite that they had no designation. The standard [...] I6 engine came with a single-barrel carburetor and three-speed manual transmission with column-shift on the wagon and four-door, or a floor-shift on the two-door. A three-speed automatic transmission was optional with column-mounted shifter in all three body styles; and ordering it included power steering, bumper guards, and the heater without extra cost in both sedan models. As for the base wagon, which had the heater regularly as standard, got a full high-trim upgrade included with the order of the automatic transmission. The four-door sedan and wagon featured a front bench seat, while the two-door sedan included low-back individual non-reclining seats. Standard were non-power brakes with front disks and rear drums, front sway bar, manual steering, a 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio, plain blacked-out dashboard, [...] dual speedometer, fixed three-point front seatbelts (retractable on base wagon), inside hood release, front ashtray, lighter, locking glove box, AM radio with antenna, rear ashtrays, round dome light, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, flat volcano hubcaps with exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> [...] "American" [...] fender emblems, [...] "4.2" [...] rear quarter emblems, manual driver's side remote mirror, base steering wheel and roof rack (wagon only). Aside from the aforementioned automatic transmission, factory optional equipment included power brakes, power steering (with manual transmission), stiffer springs and shocks, wheel trim rings, sports steering wheel, luxury steering wheel, passenger's side remote mirror, tinted windshield, parcel shelf (standard on wagon), bright molding package, bumper guards (with manual transmission), and heater (for manual sedans).|$|E
50|$|Wheel <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> {{may have}} {{different}} shapes. Aftermarket alloy and forged rims often require specific <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to match their mounting holes, so it is often required {{to get a new}} set of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> when the rims are changed.|$|E

5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} <b>lug</b> <b>nut.</b> This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, {{the four}} tire changers remove the wheels and install the new ones. IndyCar wheels are {{affixed to the}} hubs with a single <b>lug</b> <b>nut,</b> making it easier and faster to change them. After the tire changes are complete, the front tire changers may use manual {{adjusters}} to adjust {{the angle of the}} car's front wing, remove debris from air intakes, or make other minor repairs. While the service is being completed by the over-the-wall crew, another crew member behind the wall may use a stick to offer the driver a refreshment.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} quarterfinals heat, Ed Carpenter was {{assessed}} a 5-second penalty {{due to an}} unsecured <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> on the left-front wheel. In the final round, Schmidt Peterson Motorsports (James Hinchcliffe) faced Team Penske (Will Power) in a best two-out-of-three matchup. By virtue of the fastest individual time during the semifinals, Power was awarded lane choice for the first finals heats, and selected the left lane. The teams swapped for the second heat. Power had the best time from the first two finals heats, and was awarded lane choice for {{the third and final}} heat. He subsequently selected the left lane again.|$|R
