5000|$|In a laser or <b>LED</b> <b>printer,</b> {{modulated}} {{light is}} projected onto the drum surface {{to create the}} latent image. The modulated light is used only to create the positive image, hence the term [...] "blackwriting".|$|E
50|$|An <b>LED</b> <b>printer</b> {{is a type}} of {{computer}} printer similar to laser printer. LED technology uses a light-emitting diode array as a light source in the printhead instead of the laser used in laser printers and, more generally, in the xerography process. The LED bar pulse-flashes across the entire page width and creates the image on the print drum or belt as it moves past.|$|E
50|$|UV <b>LED</b> <b>Printers</b> are {{typically}} used to print directly onto a hard substrate. Its ability to immediately dry the ink {{is an advantage}} in printing {{on a variety of}} materials including glass, plastic, plexiglass, etc. UV <b>LED</b> <b>printers</b> are often used in the promotional products industry to print on pens, usb drives and mugs. Current models of commercial <b>LED</b> UV <b>Printers</b> like the Compress iUV600s and iUV1200s are also capable of adding texture to a print.|$|R

50|$|LEDs {{are more}} {{efficient}} and reliable than conventional laser printers, since they have fewer moving parts, allowing for less mechanical wear. Depending on design, <b>LED</b> <b>printers</b> can have faster rates of print than some laser-based designs, and are generally cheaper to manufacture. In contrast to <b>LED</b> <b>printers,</b> laser printers require combinations of rotating mirrors and lenses that must remain in alignment throughout their use. The LED print head has no moving parts.|$|R
40|$|Electrophotographic {{printers}} {{are used}} widely in offices. There {{are two types}} of the electrophotographic printers: light emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> <b>printer</b> and laser printer. The <b>LED</b> <b>printer</b> has LED printheads as light sources. In the LED printhead, LEDs are arrayed in a row in high density (LED array). The length of the LED array is equal to the printing width of the <b>LED</b> <b>printer.</b> In the <b>LED</b> <b>printer,</b> each LED in the LED array provides each light spot on a photosensitive drum to create each image spot in printings. This is of great advantage to high-resolution, high-speed, and large width printings using the <b>LED</b> <b>printer.</b> We have developed successively new high definition LED printheads for higher-resolution and higher-speed printings.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, much effort {{had been placed}} to {{integrate}} optoelectronic and electronic devices. Silicon on lattice engineered substrate (SOLES) had been developed for such purpose. As SOLES technology mature, a technological analysis is important so as to evaluate its potentials. In this report, a technological assessment will {{be done on the}} SOLES technology. This technology will be evaluated technologically and economically. The IP landscape in which SOLES would be applied is also looked into so as to ensure {{that there would be no}} infringement of intellectual properties. It has been concluded in this report that <b>LED</b> <b>printer</b> market would be a good introduction application for SOLES. A fabless company model is suggested as the start-up approach. A simple cost model had been done in this report. Cost of fabrication is expected to be reduced by 13 % by changing current fabrication process to SOLES process. On the final note, if SOLES could capture a market share in the world market of 0. 1 % to 1 %, the expected profit was projected to be about USD$ 1. 32 M over the next five years, with an expected sales of about 210 thousand unit, averaging about USD$ 264 K per annum. by Man Yin Leung.

50|$|By using a {{cylinder}} {{to carry the}} photosensor, automatic processing was enabled. In 1960, the automatic photocopier was created and many millions have been built since. The same process is used in microform printers and computer output laser or <b>LED</b> <b>printers.</b> A metal cylinder called the drum is mounted to rotate about a horizontal axis. The drum rotates {{at the speed of}} paper output. One revolution passes the drum surface through the steps described below.|$|R
50|$|OKI Data has {{developed}} specialty <b>LED</b> <b>Printers</b> that use a CMYW toner system rather than CMYK. The OKI 920WT and 711WT {{have been developed}} for the apparel decorating industry, replacing the typical BLACK toners ("K") with a White toner. The purpose is to allow the heat transfer application to dark fabrics and maintain the vibrancy of the colors. The LED immediate prints and dries the full color image onto a velum like material that is then heat pressed to an adhesive sheet for application.|$|R
40|$|MasterWe {{now have}} {{fabricated}} the PQR to replace LED and Micro-collimator to replace selfoc-lens array. LED is a spontaneous emission device, has many limit. LED can further {{be replaced by}} an efficient laser like the photonic quantum ring (PQR) laser diode with extremely low threshold currents and √T-dependent thermally stable spectral properties good for fast, high density array applications. The multi-petal flower PQR laser is also very superior in near-vertical lasing, luminous efficiency, dynamic range and color purity, leading to superior Gaussian beam profiles converted from initial Laguerre-Gaussian beams within 50 to 100 microns ranges. For instance, high-power 12 -petal flower PQR lasers of mesa type vertical cavity, consisting of a QW active region sandwiched by p- and n- type distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structures, out-perform the <b>LED</b> Laser <b>printers</b> with mechanically rotating polygon mirrors have been used widely in offices, whereas new <b>LED</b> <b>printers,</b> quiet and all-electronic drive circuitry with no moving parts, begin to replace them. However, typical <b>LED</b> <b>printers</b> use selfoc-lens arrays (SLAs) to concentrate and guide individual light, but the expensive SLA technology is complicated and monopolized by a Japanese co. On the other hand, we have developed a micro-collimator for non-parallel to parallel beam guiding to replace the SLA technology. The micro-collimator can be fabricated through a few processing steps, once its ray optics design is optimized for light microguiding with right focal lengths. In order to fabricate the micro-collimator we use a photoresist reflow method and soft molding. A photoresist layer is patterned by conventional photolithography {{and an array of}} dots reflow into multi- lens shape. We then transfer the photoresist microstructure to a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by a casting method. The PDMS is spin coated where the coating revolutions per minute (rpm) should be adjusted for proper thickness. Details of the design, its fabrication, and the results will be described...|$|R
50|$|Carlson's {{innovation}} combined {{electrostatic printing}} with photography, unlike the dry electrostatic printing process invented by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in 1778. Carlson's original process was cumbersome, requiring several manual processing steps with flat plates. It was almost 18 years before a fully automated process was developed, the key breakthrough being {{use of a}} cylindrical drum coated with selenium instead of a flat plate. This resulted in the first commercial automatic copier, the Xerox 914, being released by Haloid/Xerox in 1960. Before that year, Carlson had proposed his idea {{to more than a}} dozen companies, but none were interested. Xerography is now used in most photocopying machines and in laser and <b>LED</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Different {{printers}} implement {{these steps}} in distinct ways. <b>LED</b> <b>printers</b> use a linear array of light-emitting diodes to [...] "write" [...] {{the light on}} the drum. The toner is based on either wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper {{may or may not be}} oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a xenon flash lamp. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.|$|R
50|$|Solvent-based inks {{began to}} be used, which were safe for food packaging, but harmful to the environment.

Today, most printers are easily adapted to water-based inks, allowing printers to recycle ink for later use.|$|R
50|$|MPP aims {{to become}} the {{equivalent}} of a high speed 3D-printer that produces three-dimensional objects directly from powder materials. This technique is based on the process principles of xerographic printers, (for example, laser or <b>LED</b> <b>printers)</b> that combine electrostatic printing with photography. The MPP process approach uses the same fundamental principles to build solid objects on a layer-by-layer basis. Layers of powder materials are generated by attracting different metal- and/or ceramic powders to their respective position on a charged pattern on a photoreceptor by means of an electrostatic field. The attracted layer is transferred to a punch and transported to the consolidation unit where each layer of part material is sintered onto the previous by pressure and heat. The procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until the three-dimensional object is fully formed and consolidated.|$|R
40|$|Accompanying the {{explosive}} growth {{in the use of}} computers, brought on by the recent “Internet boom, ” and the trend toward more data requiring color, growth in the color printer market has continued at a rapid pace. In offices, data coloration has started and the arrival of color printers with high image quality is keenly awaited. As one possible solution, there is the tandem-type color electrophotographic <b>printer</b> which uses <b>LED</b> printheads. Comparing this <b>LED</b> tandem <b>printer</b> to a normal laser scanner type printer, the former needs no rotary mechanism, such as a polygon mirror, so it can be smaller and operate faster. However, to achieve color printers with even faster speeds and even better image quality, LED printheads are required which have higher light output and higher resolution. In addition, because tandem-type color <b>LED</b> <b>printers</b> require four printheads, there is a demand for “low cost LED printheads. ” In response to this need, we have found a solution by developing a new LED printhead. It incorporates [a] a new type of LED array 1, 2) which has a luminescent element characterized by high light output and high density and [b] a matrixshaped multi-layer wiring configuration. Here we discuss each characteristic and specification of the LED printhead we developed and the advantages of the new type of LED array which is the key element of the head...|$|R
40|$|To {{satisfy the}} demand for higher quality, {{manufacturers}} of LED print heads for electrophotography need effective measurement tools, both for quality and process control in production and for research and development. For <b>LED</b> <b>printers,</b> mid-tone gray-level uniformity {{is one of the}} key quality attributes. Because the print quality is very sensitive to print head performance, using carefully designed test targets with a commercially available image quality analysis system, LED print head quality can be quantified and characterized. This paper describes a measurement and diagnostic method of LED print heads and non-uniformity characterization using banding and line analysis tools. An advanced signal processing technique, discrete wavelet transform, was applied to decompose the signal and extract key information for LED print head quality. The correlation between vertical banding and LED print head defects will be discussed via a case study...|$|R

2500|$|In 1887 an {{association}} with a London commodity broker and book collector Thomas James Wise {{saw the first}} of many illegal printings by Wise and Buxton Forman. The origins began in November 1886 when Edward Dowden published a biography of Shelley. It printed a considerable number of poems {{for the first time that}} Forman and Wise decided to print separately as Poems and Sonnets inventing the Philadelphia Historical Society as a cover. It was the start of a full scale conspiracy with numerous forgeries over the next fifteen years that were printed in London with templates that stated otherwise. They specialised in early pamphlets, supposedly privately published, of poets some of whom such as Rossetti and Swinburne were still living. Many of the forgeries were printed by the firm of Richard Clay & Sons who had printed legitimate facsimile issues of works by Robert Browning and Percy Shelley. [...] These were [...] "creative forgeries" [...] in that they were not copies of works that existed but were presented as works that could or should have existed. [...] Dates, places of publication, publishers (as distinct from <b>printers)</b> <b>led</b> the collecting world to believe in the 'rare private' editions. Buxton Forman and Wise forged publications by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot, John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Alfred Tennyson, George Meredith and William Thackeray and many others. Many of these forgeries were sold by Buxton Forman [...] and Wise to collectors across the English speaking world and it would be forty years later that their fraud would be discovered by John Carter. The extent of the forgeries was such that the Brayton Ives sale in New York in 1915 contained twenty four forgeries, for example.|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} project {{started out}} as initially proposed. During the many long hours of work, the project changed. Many unexpected events made the project more difficult. The original idea was to organize, select, print, market and copywrite eleven years of auto racing negatives. The selection of a print shop was the first problem. The cost of the book was considerable. The result was an inferior printer. A problem in communication was next. Deadlines were given and agreed upon but never were met during the whole project. The failure to meet the deadlines over a {{extended period of time}} left no alternative. An agreement was reached with the print shop manager and I began to do the work with the notable exception of the running of the press. This was the major change in the original project. This change led to a more technical approach. The actual involvement with the book was now centered around learning about layouts, signatures, flats, halftones, line than raw talent to be successful. Things like training, copy, cutting and pasting photographs, dot patterns, and making plates for the press. This proved to be a positive learning experience. In closing, there are three main points. The first point is how much the project changed over the course of time. The result of little money, poor communication and the use of a poor quality <b>printer</b> <b>led</b> to the failure of the final product as a marketable book. Point two is that even though the final product is not as planned, the project will continue even beyond the creative project. A final marketable product is the goal and the creative project is just a step in reaching that goal. Lastly, I have developed a new appreciation for what a true artist is. It takes more education, experiences, environment, dedication, money {{are just a few of}} the qualities needed. All of these factors and more have been discovered in the making of this book. It has helped me establish new guidelines for what makes a true artist. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
