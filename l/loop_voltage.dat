40|$|Abstract—This paper explores a new {{configuration}} for modular dc–dc converters, namely, {{series connection}} at the input, and parallel connection at the output, {{such that the}} converters share the input voltage and load current equally. This {{is an important step}} toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output <b>voltage</b> <b>loop,</b> individual inner current loops, and individual input <b>voltage</b> <b>loops,</b> is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output <b>voltage</b> <b>loop</b> provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input <b>voltage</b> <b>loops.</b> The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input <b>voltage</b> <b>loops.</b> This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of dc–dc converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed.

In response to this need, digital non-linear carrier (DNLC) PFC control has been developed and is presented in this thesis. DNLC PFC control offers many unique advantages over existing PFC control techniques in terms of design simplicity, low harmonic current shaping over a wide load range including CCM and DCM operation and a reliable, inexpensive digital implementation based on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (A/D 2 ̆ 7 s) and digital pulse width modulator (DPWM). Implementation of the controller requires no microcontroller or digital signal processor (DSP) programming, and is well suited for a simple, low-cost integrated-circuit realization.
