Then SCMaps(S,T) M is a continuous map from <b>S</b> into T. <b>Let</b> <b>S</b> be a non empty relational structure and let T be a non empty reflexive relational structure. One can verify that every map from S into T which is constant is also monotone. <b>Let</b> <b>S</b> be a non empty relational structure, let T be a reflexive non empty relational structure, and let a be an element of T. One can check that S ↦− → a is monotone. One can prove the following propositions: (2) <b>Let</b> <b>S</b> be a non empty relational structure and T be a lower-bounded antisymmetric reflexive non empty relational structure. Then ⊥ MonMaps(S,T) = S ↦− → ⊥T. (3) <b>Let</b> <b>S</b> be a non empty relational structure and T be an upper-bounded antisymmetric reflexive non empty relational structure. Then ⊤ MonMaps(S,T) = S ↦− → ⊤T. (4) <b>Let</b> <b>S,</b> T be complete lattices, f be a monotone map from S into T, and x be an element of S. Then f(x) = sup (f ◦ ↓x).
