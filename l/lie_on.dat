5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the perpendicular bisector line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> {{the same side of the}} tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E

5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus.

These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E

Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al.
