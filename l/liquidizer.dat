500|$|Mario {{sets out}} for Isle Delfino for a {{vacation}} with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As {{a result of this}} pollution, sun-shaped objects called [...] "Shine Sprites", the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named [...] "Shadow Mario". To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds a Flash <b>Liquidizer</b> Ultra Dousing Device or F.L.U.D.D., a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario defeats a giant slime covered Piranha Plant and restores the airstrip, but he is subsequently arrested by two Pianta police officers who accuse him of vandalizing Isle Delfino with graffiti, {{despite the fact that he}} has only just arrived. He is put on trial, which turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites, in spite of Princess Peach's objection to the ruling. He is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, after spending the night in a cell, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino.|$|E

40|$|Background: Household {{pesticides}} (biocides) {{are widely}} used {{for the purpose of}} controlling vector-borne diseases. Exposure to biocides causes various health hazards in human beings. Prevalence of biocide use, storage methods, and personal protection measures while handling biocides are not known among rural households in South India. Material and Methods: A communitybased cross-sectional study was conducted among 416 households in rural Puducherry (union territory). Information on household biocide use, frequency of use, storage and personal safety practices were captured using pretested questionnaire. Continuous variables like age are summarized by mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables like gender, education, a type of a house, biocide usage and related handling practices are summarized as proportions. Results: Majority (85 %) of the households reported presence of at least 1 biocide. Mosquito <b>liquidizer</b> was the most commonly used biocide (45 %) followed by mosquito coil (31 %), ant powder (30 %) and ant chalk (20 %). Protection measures against the majority of used biocides were used only in few households and no personal protection measures were used while handling mosquito coil, mat, ant chalk and rat powder. Conclusions: The prevalence of household biocide use is high in the study setting. Storage, handling and post handling practices were not sufficient to protect health.
