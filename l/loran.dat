5|$|Lichtenstein and <b>Loran</b> sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by <b>Loran</b> to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|Not {{everyone}} served aboard ships {{during the}} war. Some men like Jose R. Zaragoza served on missions on some lonely atolls. When 19-year-old Zaragoza, {{a native of}} Los Angeles, California, joined the Coast Guard, he was sent on patrols in the Pacific coast of the United States to defend against sabotage and invasion from the Japanese. Later he received instructions in the then-emerging and secretive field of <b>LORAN</b> navigation and was sent to Ulithi atoll, located between Guam and the Philippines. He assisted with <b>LORAN</b> research and development, and served on Ulithi for 15 months.|$|E

5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the <b>LORAN</b> Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in <b>LORAN</b> (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the Haitian Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for the Haitian military leadership and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25BM target-tower was {{designed}} to provide towed target facilities for training ground forces and naval personnel in ground-to-air or naval surface-to-air missile systems. It is powered by an R-195 engine and equipped with an RSDN-10 long-range navigation system, an analogue of the Western <b>LORAN</b> system.|$|E
5|$|After monsters {{possessed the}} Carmen's king for seven years, the kingdom {{fell to the}} hordes of evil. The only {{survivors}} were Prince Arus and an army General's daughter, Lunafrea.

As Loto's descendant, Arus, along with Lunafrea, set out to defeat the monsters and restore peace to the world.|$|E
50|$|The antenna and all {{electrical}} equipment were located on Sand Island, {{northeast of the}} main island. Its tall antenna, guyed with four cables, was nearly {{in line with the}} extended centerline of the island's runway, so departing aircraft were required to initiate a shallow right turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hazard. Shortly after the <b>LORAN's</b> decommissioning, the antenna was felled to remove that hazard.|$|R
50|$|CYCLAN {{operated}} by sending the same LF LORAN-like signals on two frequencies, LF <b>LORAN's</b> 180 kHz {{and again on}} 200 kHz. The associated equipment would look for a rising amplitude that indicated {{the start of the}} signal pulse, and then use sampling gates to extract the carrier phase. Using two receivers solved the problem of mis-aligning the pulses, because the phases would only align properly between the two copies of the signal when the same pulses were being compared. None of this was trivial; using the era's tube-based electronics, the experimental CYCLAN system filled much of a semi-trailer.|$|R
50|$|Maurice Druon's {{historical}} novel series Les Rois maudits dramatises this theory. In La Loi des mâles (1957), the infant John is temporarily switched {{with the child}} of Guccio Baglioni and Marie de Cressay as a decoy. He is subsequently poisoned by Mahaut, Countess of Artois, in order to place John's uncle (and Mahaut's son-in-law), Philippe, Count of Poitiers, on the throne. Marie is coerced into secretly raising John as her own son, named Giannino Baglioni. An adult Giannino was portrayed by Jean-Gérard Sandoz in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by <b>Lorans</b> Stoica in the 2005 adaptation.|$|R

Combat Skyspot was complemented by expanding the radio-based <b>LORAN</b> system utilized by other strike aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as <b>LORAN.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Loran-C had {{originally}} been designed to be highly automated, allowing the system to be operated more rapidly than the original <b>LORAN's</b> multi-minute measurement. It was also operated in [...] "chains" [...] of linked stations, allowing a fix {{to be made by}} simultaneously comparing two slaves to a single master. The downside of this approach was that the required electronic equipment, built using 1950s-era tube technology, was very large. Looking for companies with knowledge of seaborne, multi-channel phase-comparison electronics led, ironically, to Decca, who built the AN/SPN-31, the first widely used Loran-C receiver. The AN/SPN-31 weighed over 100 lbs kg and had 52 controls.|$|R
50|$|OBARC {{hosted a}} series of monthly {{seminars}} from 2004 to 2007, organized in collaboration with Alpha Bank and the History Department at Bogaziçi University. Focusing on the Greek-Orthodox populations during the late Ottoman period and {{the first decades of}} the Republic, the seminars addressed issues concerning ethnic and civic identity, inter-communal relations, urban culture, educational policies, commercial activities, social networks, the exchange of populations, and the Patriarchate. To foster discussion among historians from both shores of the Aegean and contribute to international research literature, the papers submitted to the seminars for three consecutive academic years were compiled into a book by Dr. <b>Lorans</b> Tanatar Baruh and Assist. Prof. Vangelis Kechriotis.|$|R
50|$|She {{was built}} at Leith around 1505 {{by order of}} King James IV of Scotland, {{as part of his}} policy of {{building}} a strong Scottish navy. He named her after his new wife, Margaret Tudor. Records of shipbuilding between 1502 and June 1506 appear to refer to her construction; two French master shipwrights John <b>Lorans</b> and Jennen Diew were among the workforce. Some of Andrew Barton's sailors were employed watching the works. At the time she was built she was considerably larger than any other ship in the Scottish navy, but soon after she was superseded by a warship which was considerably larger again, Michael. As her maiden voyage, the ship took James IV to the Isle of May in July 1506. New equipment included nine crossbows, 6 compasses, and two night glasses.|$|R
5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the <b>LORAN</b> C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and <b>LORAN,</b> a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and <b>LORAN.</b> Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E
40|$|Sous la {{direction}} de E. <b>Lorans</b> et X. RodierThis {{contribution is}} a methodology-oriented discussion over how analysts of heritage architecture {{can handle the}} parameter time. The paper first argues {{that we are not}} equally equipped (in terms of concepts, in terms of computer formalisms) to handle space & time, in particular when dealing with historical data sets where lacks and doubts are key. Focus is then put on time, and we observe that relevant contributions to the problem of time-oriented data, and to the uncertainty issue, have lately emerged in the visual analytics scientific community. We then propose a categorisation of the notion of uncertainty, and finally introduce and exemplify generic characteristics of the parameter time in order to reinforce the analyst's capacity to perform cumulative, comparison-rich, reasoning tasks. Dans cette contribution nous nous interrogerons sur une entrée par le paramètre temps, donc sur comment caractériser et visualiser un moment, une période, un cycle, un ordre en tant que tels, autrement dit sur comment raisonner sur le paramètre temps. Nous le faisons en prenant appui sur les legs et apports de la communauté infovis (information visualisation) en la matière...|$|R
5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail <b>LORAN</b> radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym <b>LORAN,</b> it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{distances and}} lack of useful navigation points in the Pacific Ocean led to widespread use of <b>LORAN</b> for both ships and aircraft during the Pacific War. In particular, the accuracy offered by <b>LORAN</b> allowed aircraft {{to reduce the amount}} of extra fuel they would otherwise have to carry to ensure they could find their base after a long mission. This reduced fuel load allowed the bombload to be increased. By the end of World War II there were 72 <b>LORAN</b> stations, with over 75,000 receivers in use.|$|E
25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard <b>LORAN</b> {{maritime}} navigation system. The <b>LORAN</b> system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF <b>LORAN</b> receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the <b>LORAN</b> signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the <b>LORAN</b> signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 1940 Mr. Alfred L.

25|$|The {{nighttime}} mode {{of operation}} was a perfect fit for RAF Bomber Command. The four test stations were dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic, and re-installed to form two chains, Aberdeen-Bizerta, and Oran-Benghazi. Known as Skywave-Synchronized <b>LORAN,</b> or SS <b>LORAN,</b> the system provided coverage anywhere south of Scotland and as far east as Poland with an average accuracy of one mile. The system was used operationally in October 1944, and by 1945 it was universally installed in No. 5 Group RAF.|$|E
25|$|<b>LORAN</b> radio {{navigation}} station Baker was a radio operations base in operation from September 1944 to July 1946. The station unit number was 91 {{and the radio}} call sign was NRN-1.|$|E
25|$|<b>LORAN</b> was {{a simple}} system that {{compared}} the arrival times of pulses to make a measurement. Ideally, perfectly formed rectangular blips would be displayed on the CRT, whose leading edge could be compared with accuracy. In practice, the transmitters cannot turn on and off instantly, and due {{to a variety of}} factors the resulting blips are spread out in time. Adding to this {{is the fact that the}} shape of the resulting blip, the envelope, depends on the frequency of the system, meaning the lower-frequency systems like <b>LORAN</b> will generally have less accuracy than higher-frequency ones like Gee.|$|E

25|$|Laboratories {{included}} {{the use of}} all types of electronic test equipment. Operational measurements and repair methods involved HF and VHF communication receivers and transmitters, air-search and fire-control radars, low-frequency <b>LORAN</b> receivers and transmitters, and sonar systems. Considerable time, particularly in the later months, was devoted to trouble-shooting.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} period, the US Army Air Force became {{interested}} in a very-high accuracy system for bombing pinpoint targets. Raytheon won a contract to develop a system called Cytac, which used the same basic techniques as LF <b>LORAN,</b> but included considerable automation to handle the timing internally without operator intervention. This proved to be extremely successful, with test-runs placing the aircraft within 10 yards of the target. As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) US Air Force lost interest in the concept. Nevertheless, they continued experimentation with the equipment after adapting it to work on LF <b>LORAN</b> frequencies and renaming it Cyclan, lowering accuracy compared to the original, but providing reasonable accuracy {{on the order of}} a mile at greatly increased distances.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1942, Robert Dippy, {{the lead}} {{developer}} of the Gee {{system at the}} Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in the UK, {{was sent to the}} US for eight months to help with <b>LORAN</b> development. At the time the project was being driven primarily by Captain Harding of the US Navy, and they were concentrating entirely on a shipboard system. Dippy convinced them that an airborne version was definitely possible, leading to some interest by the US Army Air Force. The Navy was unhappy about this turn of events. Dippy also instituted a number of simple changes that would prove extremely useful in practice. Among these, he outright demanded that the airborne <b>LORAN</b> receivers be built physically similar to the Gee receivers, so that they could be swapped out in service simply by replacing the receiver unit. This would prove extremely useful; RAF Transport Command aircraft could swap their receivers when moving to or from the Australian theatre. Dippy also designed the ground station timing equipment.|$|E
