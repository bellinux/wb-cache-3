5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

40|$|On Learning Classifier Systems dubbed LCSs a leaning {{strategy}} which defines how LCSs cover a state-action {{space in}} a problem {{can be one of}} the most fundamental options in designing LCSs. There lacks an intensive study of the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> to understand whether and how the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> affects the performance of LCSs. This lack has resulted in the current design methodology of LCS which does not carefully consider the types of <b>learning</b> <b>strategy.</b> The thesis clarifies a need of a design methodology of LCS based on the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy.</b> That is, the thesis shows the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> can be an option that determines the potential performance of LCSs and then claims that LCSs should be designed on the basis of the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> in order to improve the performance of LCSs. First, the thesis empirically claims that the current design methodology of LCS, without the consideration of <b>learning</b> <b>strategy,</b> can be limited to design a proper LCS to solve a problem. This supports the need of design methodology based on the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy.</b> Next, the thesis presents an example of how LCS can be designed on the basis of the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy.</b> The thesis empirically show an adequate <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> improving the performance of LCS can be decided depending on a type of problem difficulties such as missing attributes. Then, the thesis draws an inclusive guideline that explains which <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> should be used to address which types of problem difficulties. Finally, the thesis further shows, on an application of LCS for a human daily activity recognition problem, the adequate <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> according to the guideline effectively improves the performance of the application. The thesis concludes that the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> is the option of the LCS design which determines the potential performance of LCSs. Thus, before designing any type of LCSs including their applications, the <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> should be adequately selected at first, because their performance degrades when they employ an inadequate <b>learning</b> <b>strategy</b> to a problem they want to solve. In other words, LCSs should be designed on the basis of the adequate <b>learning</b> <b>strategy.</b> 電気通信大学 201...|$|R

[...] Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating.

For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls [...] "imitative learning," [...] (as opposed to [...] "emulative learning" [...] characteristic of other primates) and second, [...] the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates).
