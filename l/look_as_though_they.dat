25|$|Extrasolar planets – methane was {{detected}} on extrasolar planet HD 189733b; {{this is the}} first detection of an organic compound on a planet outside the solar system. Its origin is unknown, since the planet's high temperature (700°C) would normally favor the formation of carbon monoxide instead. Research indicates that meteoroids slamming against exoplanet atmospheres could add hydrocarbon gases such as methane, making the exoplanets <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> are inhabited by life, even if they are not.|$|E
500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|Herman Zimmerman was the {{production}} designer, and had {{three months to}} design and construct 55 full sets for the filmeighteen more than used in the previous film in the series. Zimmerman {{said that it was}} [...] "probably the most scenery we've built for a Star Trek motion picture since the first one, when everything was brand new". The Ba'ku village was built in full scale on location at Lake Sherwood, California, with architectural designs combining Thai, Balinese and Polynesian styles. The village included a bakery, a farm with a full irrigation system, a city hall, and a city square which was referred to as the [...] "rotunda". The location shoot lasted for six weeks. The buildings included sections built with styrofoam, which were cut out using computer aided design and computer-aided manufacturing techniques. These were covered in hardcoat to make them <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were made from stone, but they were not made waterproof. The set suffered water damage following record-levels of rainfall during the spring of 1998. The foam warped as it dried out in the sun, causing delays in shooting while repairs were made.|$|E

500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E
500|$|Dawkins was {{confirmed}} into the Church of England {{at the age}} of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. After learning about Darwinism and the scientific reason why living things <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> have been designed, Dawkins lost the remainder of his religious faith. He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilized world could still be so uneducated in biology, and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins notes that some physicists use 'God' {{as a metaphor for the}} general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being which forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die. He disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA) and suggests that the existence of God should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other. Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence. He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as [...] "one of the world's great evils".|$|E

She has created different installations in the series and realizes her vision with the collaboration of family and friends, in a sort of raising the roof effort that involves many people working together as a community.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time that the monarchy and various {{corporations}} developed downtown Honolulu with their renditions of Hawaiian renaissance styles, residential homes were being built in the outskirts of the city and elsewhere in the state. [...] The style became known as Hawaiian plantation architecture featuring low profile wood frames, vertical plank siding and large porticos. [...] Roofs were the most distinguishable parts of Hawaiian plantation structures as they were wide-hipped or bellcast and had eaves that were deep bracketed. [...] When viewed against the natural Hawaiian environment, Hawaiian plantation structures <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> blend easily with their surroundings. [...] The style gets its name from the sugarcane and pineapple plantations which employed the design for laborer homesteads.|$|E
50|$|The Communists {{emerged from}} the war sharing the vast {{prestige}} of the victorious Soviet armed forces, {{and for a while}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> might take power in France, Italy and Greece.

60|$|Two of {{the hands}} went and peeped furtively down through the skylight. The empty cabin looked strangely quiet and drear, and {{the door of the}} state-room stood ajar.

2500|$|The home side won the toss and batted first, {{but failed}} {{to make the most of}} the {{opportunity}} to use what appeared to be a pretty flat pitch. [...] Lathwell and Atherton struggled early on, and it was only when Robin Smith came to the crease that England started to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> might post a competitive score. [...] His fluent 86, and a half-century from Hussain kept hopes alive, though at 276/6 at the end of the first day, coach Keith Fletcher was unhappy with the way the batsmen had got themselves out, criticising three [...] "soft" [...] dismissals in the top six. Hughes (5-92) and Warne (3-74) bowled well again, and wrapped up the innings early on day two.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{one would}} expect 一 to be located on G, and 二 on F, and 三 on D, and indeed, this is the case. [...] Similarly, {{one would expect}} 丨 to be located on H, 刂 to be on J, and 川 to be on K. [...] This pattern holds for all the zones. [...] Furthermore, it extends to most {{radicals}} that <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> {{are made up of}} three such strokes, even if in fact they might not be at all. [...] An example of this is 中 on K: while it does not have three downward strokes (two only), it appears to have three. [...] Furthermore, it is written by hand by first writing a mouth radical, 口, and then bisecting it with a vertical downward stroke. [...] The mouth radical lies on 'K', so this makes the assignment doubly logical. [...] And the pinyin romanization of 口, kou3, begins with k, another memory aid encoded into the Wubi keyboard.|$|E
2500|$|The European {{roots of}} the {{community}} are predominantly from small German states which are comprised by the Germany of today and from the region known as Montbéliard in eastern France. [...] Waterloo Settlement's first settlers were {{sons and daughters of}} second and third-generation German and Montbéliardian immigrants brought to Nova Scotia as loyal citizens to the British crown in 1750–52. The French-speaking Montbéliardians were considered good candidates to emigrate since they were known to be [...] "very frugal, as well as strong independent laborers" [...] (Withrow, 2002). [...] As for the Germans (and likely the Swiss), Judge Debrisay quotes a number of stereotypes and impressions that developed and existed of the first German immigrants up to 1895, at least 140 years after their arrival. [...] "They are a big, square-shouldered, deep-chested race. [...] They do not talk much, but <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> thought—easy going, and good tempered... they are hearty eaters, but they are not fussy and finikin over their food... so long as the dish is wholesome, and there is sufficient of it, they are satisfied... in the sensuous arts of painting and sculpture, the Germans are poor. [...] In the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great, and this fact provides a key to their character. [...] They are simple, earnest, homely, genuine people. [...] They do not laugh much, but when they do they laugh deep down. [...] They are slow, but so is a deep river... The Germans believe in themselves, and respect themselves".|$|E

60|$|It {{consisted}} of but two rooms, one for living {{and one for}} sleeping. In the former we found Brother John and his wife seated {{on a kind of}} couch gazing at each other in a rapt way.

50|$|When {{travelling}} fast, a group <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> are bouncing {{along on}} the water, as they make low leaps together, sometimes travelling as far as 7 m in one leap. They often approach boats and partake in bow-riding behavior. These graceful swimmers are spotted occasionally doing acrobatics, such as breaching, belly-flopping, side slapping, and lobtailing.|$|R
60|$|He rose {{early the}} next morning, and, after {{remarking}} to Mrs. Grummit that Mr. Evans's flowers <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> wanted rain, went off to his work.

6000|$|... "Where are {{the rest}} of you, and Maxwell?" [...] asked Redmond. [...] "You can't have lost the whole of them; though there's no need to tell me {{something}} has gone wrong.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Direck, [...] "what you {{say about}} {{domestication}} does {{seem to me to}} be very true indeed. Why! even those clouds up there <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> had a shepherd and were grazing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Inez Robertson," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{will go to}} wake my father. Meanwhile please unyoke your oxen.

60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{she seemed to}} be inspired; and her eyes had a far-away <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> saw {{something}} beyond mortal sight. And then the deep eyes filled up with unshed tears of great emotion. The very soul of the woman seemed to speak in her voice; whilst we who listened sat entranced.|$|E
60|$|So {{those men}} went thankfully enough, {{and the land}} saw them no more. As they passed the gate other men entered, starved and hungry-looking men, whose bones almost pierced their skins, and who carried in their hands {{remnants}} of shields that <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> had been gnawed by rats. They saluted the King with feeble voices, and squatted down upon the ground.|$|R
60|$|The {{action was}} as loving and trusting as any {{that could have}} been {{manifested}} by a white child. Jonathan Zane stared with a curious light in his dark eyes; Mr. Wells and Jim <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> doubted the evidence of their own sight.

60|$|Eustace, he told himself, {{he disliked}} rather {{more than any}} of the others.
