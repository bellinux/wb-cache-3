It has been found on boulders under stones and beaches ranging from open and exposed coasts to sheltered bays. It is a fairly common crab on New Zealand shores and will typically outnumber the larger common rock crab species. It can be found near the <b>littoral</b> <b>sea</b> fringe where it is wetted only slightly or not at all. It has also been found in intertidal levels, mudflats, estuaries and rocky shores. The larger individuals from the Cyclograpsus lavauxi species are often found higher on the foreshore or mudflats than the younger Cyclograpsus lavauxi generations. The younger generation tend to live in the lower lines of the foreshore and mudflats. During the summer months, the Cyclograpsus lavauxi population move down into the lower foreshore line.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{investigation}} in the Yellow River Estuary Sea Area in May 2009, 30 surface sea water samples were taken for soluble heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg and As). The average concentrations of the soluble heavy metals in surface seawater were 2. 65, 0. 51, 37. 7, 0. 68, 0. 013, 0. 92 μg·L- 1 respectively. The concentrations of soluble heavy metals decreased from <b>littoral</b> <b>sea</b> area and the Yellow River Estuary to the central sea area, which reflected obviously affects of human activities, Yellow River and the land source pollution. Except at some particular stations, most concentration values of heavy metals did not exceed those of the primary standard of Seawater Quality Standard of China. Zn pollution is more serious than other heavy metals, which exceed the primary standard but lower than the secondary standard. Compared with other typical seas, the heavy metal concentration of the Yellow River Estuary is lower than that in the Jiaozhou Bay, but higher than the North Yellow Sea, the South Yellow Sea, and the South Sea...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the importance of spatial and environmental factors on the structure and diversity of bacterial communities, high-resolution 16 S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing was applied to bacterial communities in the <b>littoral</b> <b>sea.</b> Seawater samples were prepared from seven different stations in the South Sea of Korea, the marginal sea in the western Pacific Ocean, and were divided into three groups according to distances from the coastline. The majority of 19, 860 sequences were affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria (58. 2 %), Gammaproteobacteria (7. 9 %), and Bacteroidetes (13. 9 %). The bacterioplankton community at each station was highly diverse and varied among the samples. Major bacterial lineages showed different niche preferences among three locational groups. Alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial class, and it harbored the most frequently recorded operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all sampling stations. However, dominant groups at the order levels showed a clear difference among the samples. The SAR 11 clade was more abundant in coastal waters while the Roseobacter clade prevailed at stations {{far away from the}} coastline. Furthermore, members of Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria also exhibited spatial variability. The OM 1 clade in Actinobacteria constituted a predominant fraction in coastal samples, but it was essentially absent at the distal stations closer to open ocean. In contrast, Synechococcus was the predominant taxon in the distal samples, accounting for 7. 1 - 19. 5 %, but was hardly detected in coastal waters, representing less than 0. 7 %. In Bacteroidetes, NS 5 and NS 9 groups tended to inhabit coastal waters while the genera Polaribacter and Ulvibacter were more abundant in distal stations. Clustering analysis and principle coordinates analysis based on OTU data indicated that bacterial communities in the studied area were separated into three groups that coincided with locational grouping. Statistical analysis showed that phosphate and dissolved oxygen concentration had a significant influence on the bacterial community composition...|$|E
40|$|The studied field area {{is located}} in {{northern}} Spain in the Álava province south {{of the town of}} Vitoria-Gasteiz. In this region the Tertiary Ebro Basin is accompanied by a small mountain chain named the Sierra de Cantabria. In this mountain chain {{the southern part of the}} Peñacerrada salt diapir was mapped at 1 : 10 000 within a 6. 1 km² sized area. The oldest exposed of the salt diapir are evaporites and pelites of Upper Triassic age. From the beginning of the Norian several transgressive and regressive periods occurred with dolomite deposition within a characteristic sabkha environment. In Upper Sinemurian the stenohaline <b>littoral</b> <b>sea</b> was deepened to a bathyal depositional centre due to extensional tectonics until the Toarcian / Aalenian boundary. The Mesozoic Basco-Cantabrian trough was closed as a result of the opening of the northern Atlantic and therefore marine sedimentation stopped at the latest in Upper Jurassic times. During the Lower Cretaceous, sedimentation was dominated by input from a deltaic shelf. After a first delta phase (REITNER & WIEDMANN, 1982) a small scale marine ingression occurred. During the first diapiric uprise of the Upper Triassic evaporites, a small patch reef complex was formed until lower Aptian times. With the break trough of the diapir, coral growth stopped. The second delta phase (REITNER & WIEDMANN, 1982) started from Albian times with sand and conglomerate deposits. This phase, with fluviatile sedimentation was stopped by the Upper Cretaceous transgression. The marine calcareous sedimentation in Cenomanian times lead to the formation of an extended carbonate platform. The extensional tectonic regime, halokinetic movements of the Upper Triassic salt, and the permanent near coastal position controlled the thickness and facies distribution of the sediments within the investigated field area. The water depths of the whole area of sedimentation continuously decreased since Santonian and therefore the terrigenous input of clastic material increased. Marine sedimentation completely stopped with the beginning of the Campanian. During Quaternary times the uplifted Mesozoic limestones were karstified and the tufaceous limestones, alluvial as well as the talus deposits were sedimented. Important structural elements of the Sierra de Cantabria are formed by halokinetic movements of the Peñacerrada salt diapir and the Pyrenees Orogeny. At the Eocene / Oligocene boundary the onset of the Pyrenees Orogeny took place. During this orogeny the former Mesozoic Ebro massif was inverted to a foreland basin (= Ebro Basin). The evaporites lead on one hand to the formation of this diapir and on the other hand they formed a favourable thrust horizon for far scale nappe transport. During the Miocene, the Mesozoic calcareous sediments of the former Basco-Cantabrian Basin were folded and thrusted in a southward direction on top of the Eocene / Oligocene sediments of the Ebro Basin. The Mesozoic units were folded and formed the Sierra de Cantabria. At the front of the Sierra de Cantabria thick fanglomerates were deposited. Pronounced halokinetic movements started at the same time. A special feature of the Pyrenees Orogeny is the formation of a tectonic diamict with striated and polished limestone fragments comparable to those formed in the impact crater from Nördlinger Ries (southern Germany). Both occurrences of these striated pebbles are formed by plastic deformation within a clay-mineral matrix under high confining pressure. This leads to the important conclusion, that striated pebbles of this specific type are not necessarily restricted to impact craters. ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRadar {{sea clutter}} {{inhomogeneity}} in range {{is characterized by}} Doppler mean and spectrum width variations. We propose a new approach for robust statistical density estimation and segmentation of sea clutter Doppler spectrum. In each range cell, Doppler {{is characterized by a}} Toeplitz Hermitian Positive Definite covariance matrix that is coded in Poincaré's unit poly-disk and we use adaptation of standard kernel methods to density estimation on this specific Riemannian manifold. Based on this non-parametric approach to estimate statistical density of Doppler Spectrum, we address the problem of sea clutter data mapping and segmentation by extending " Mean-Shift " tool for these densities on Poincaré's unit poly-disk. This statistical segmentation is requested for robust detection of targets in sea clutter, especially in case of high sea state. I. INHOMOGENEOUS DOPPLER SPECTRUM OF SEA CLUTTER We are studying highly variable Doppler spectrum characteristics that occur in the <b>littoral</b> <b>sea</b> clutter environment, to improve robustness of adaptive coherent CFAR detector. Doppler that is observed varies from 0 to 5 m/s and peaks at more than 10 m/s induced by breaking waves. The coastal circulation has local characteristics and is very variable depending on weather conditions. Close to the shore, we {{have to take into account}} drift currents. The permanent and seasonal components constitute the so-called general currents. These are generally low. The wind generates the drive current drift of the surface layers, which is transmitted by viscosity to the deeper layers. According to the theory, for a wind that had blown in the same direction for several days at any point of a body of water and indefinite water depth (over 200 m), the surface drift current is directed at 45 ° of the wind direction. The decrease of these parameters (duration, extent, depth) has the effect of reducing the deviation. So, near the coast and variable wind, the surface drift current is substantially oriented in the direction of the wind. The coast is an obstacle for the drift current, causing an accumulation or conversely a water withdrawal, according to the relative orientation of the wind and of the coastline. Tidal currents are often distinguished by their very high speed. They can indeed be greater than 10 knots (5 m/s). Usually the directions of the tide vary very quickly. The variation of the current amplitude with the amplitude of the wave is not equal if the tide behaves like a wave, a standing wave or an hydraulic phenomenon of filling/emptying a basin. In figure 1, we give the surface currents in knots from the SHOM close to Ouessant Island. Variations can therefore be seen from 0 to 4 m/s. Figure 1. Maximum current in knots in French Brittany close to the Shore IFREMER has developed the accurate Mars model (coastal hydrodynamic model) as illustrated in the figure 2 : Figure 2. Residual streams in m 2 /s (speed x water level) for different exposure to winds, illustrating the spatial variability of the current. As consequence, Doppler mean is not zero and varies along the range axis, induced by means of Doppler surface current (which may vary depending on the distance to the coast and wind exposure). These variations may be important and equal to several meters per second (tidal current and the case of variable wind exposure in the presence of island or local phenomena depending on the water depth). The spectral width of the sea clutter may also vary along the distance axis based on the variable swell after exposure to wind. Simulation of coherent radar sea clutter has been described in [20, 21, 22, 23]. For the Ground Clutter of the Shore, the Doppler spectrum width could vary with vegetation and wind exposure. We illustrate in the figure 3, Doppler variations of clutter in littoral environment...|$|E

One such hull form is the trimaran. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of side hull position on the wave making resistance characteristics of powered trimarans. Resistance calculations were performed by a three dimensional, Rankine panel code. A systematic series of runs was conducted in order to classify ship resistance in terms of major trimaran hull geometric configurations.
