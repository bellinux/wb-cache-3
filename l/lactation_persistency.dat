40|$|Abstract Background In sheep dairy production, total {{lactation}} performance, {{and length}} of lactation of lactation are of economic significance. A more persistent lactation {{has been associated with}} improved udder health. An extended lactation is defined by a longer period of milkability. This study is the first investigation to examine the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for extended lactation and <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> in sheep. Methods An (Awassi × Merino) × Merino single-sire backcross family with 172 ewes was used to map QTL for <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and extended lactation traits on a framework map of 189 loci across all autosomes. The Wood model was fitted to data from multiple lactations to estimate parameters of ovine lactation curves, and these estimates were used to derive measures of <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and extended lactation traits of milk, protein, fat, lactose, useful yield, and somatic cell score. These derived traits were subjected to QTL analyses using maximum likelihood estimation and regression analysis. Results Overall, one highly significant (LOD > 3. 0), four significant (2. 0 Conclusion This study identified ten novel QTL for <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and extended lactation in sheep, but results suggest that <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and extended lactation do not have a major gene in common.

40|$|To {{estimate}} heritability {{and genetic}} trend for 305 -d milk production and <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency,</b> {{a total of}} 130, 668 monthly test day milk yields belonging to 15, 183 first lactation Holstein cows in 131 herds and calved from 2000 to 2009 were used. To calculate 305 -d milk yield as well as <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency,</b> estimated parameters of Wilmink’s exponential function were applied.

40|$|Application of test-day {{models for}} the genetic {{evaluation}} of dairy populations requires the solution of large mixed model equations. The size of the (co) variance matrices required with such models can be reduced {{through the use of}} its first eigenvectors. Here, the first two eigenvectors of (co) variance matrices estimated for dairy traits in first lactation were used as covariables to jointly estimate genetic parameters of the first three lactations. These eigenvectors appear to be similar across traits and have a biological interpretation, one being related to the level of production and the other to persistency. Furthermore, they explain more than 95 % of the total genetic variation. Variances and heritabilities obtained with this model were consistent with previous studies. High correlations were found among production levels in different <b>lactations.</b> <b>Persistency</b> measures were less correlated. Genetic correlations between second and third lactations were close to one, indicating that these can be considered as the same trait.

40|$|A current {{trend in}} the dairy {{industry}} is to reduce milk yield {{at the peak of}} lactation and improve <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency.</b> <b>Lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> is influenced by livestock management factors, such as feeding level or milking frequency, or by physiological status, including reproductive status or calving period. These factors modulate mammary gland apoptosis and tissue remodeling, which determine the rate of decline of milk yield after the lactation peak. Previous studies on lactating cows suggested that ovarian steroids {{have a negative effect on}} milk yield after the peak of lactation. In the present study, 4 Holstein x Normande crossbred multiparous cows were ovariectomized at the time of the lactation peak, and 5 cows underwent sham operations. All of the cows were maintained in lactation for 14 mo and milk yield was recorded daily. At slaughter, mammary epithelial cell apoptosis and mammary tissue remodeling were assessed. Ovariectomized cows had improved <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and presented an average daily milk gain of 2. 5 kg compared with the sham-operated cows between mo 6 and 14 of lactation. The ovariectomy appears to have limited the decline in the milk yield after the peak of lactation by reducing mammary epithelial cell apoptosis [by reducing poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase expression] and mammary-tissue remodeling (by reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity). In conclusion, removal of ovarian secretion via ovariectomy improved the cows' <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency...</b>|$|E

Least squares analysis and the incomplete gamma function were used to investigate differences in early milk yield, peak milk yield, time from onset to the <b>lactation</b> peak, <b>persistency,</b> total milk yield and lactation duration. The highest early yields were observed for Holstein-Gyr and Holstein-Zebu, and the lowest were observed for Holstein-Nellore cows. Early yield increased with lactation number, and the lactations that began in the late rainy and early dry seasons had the highest early yield. The time between lactation onset and the lactation peak was longer for primiparous Holstein-Gyr and Holstein-Guzerat cows. The lowest yields at the lactation peak were observed for the first lactation number. The highest values of persistency were observed for the first lactation number in Holstein-Guzerat cows. Total production from Holstein-Gyr and Holstein-Zebu cows were higher by approximately 14 % and 29 % compared with Holstein-Guzerat and Holstein-Nellore cows, respectively. The highest total yields were observed in lactations beginning in the dry season. Total yield increased with lactation number.

40|$|Current {{measures}} of <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> are not uniformly {{applicable to the}} variety of lactation curves for individual cows.

The curvilinear model is appropriate for trend analysis, a major manifestation of which is persistency. Data fitted to the model were obtained from a total of 194 lactations of 169 cows in 5 mixed-breed herds under conditions varying from a small holding herd in the tropics to research herds in Italy.

Two common latent factors related to level of production in early lactation and <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency,</b> and 2 principal components associated with the whole lactation yield and persistency were obtained. Factor and principal component scores were treated as new quantitative phenotypes related to prominent features of lactation curve shape. Genetic parameters were estimated by univariate and bivariate animal models. Estimates of heritability were moderately low for both latent factors (0. 13 for persistency and yield early in lactation). Heritabilities of the principal component related to total lactation yield and 305 -d yield were similar (0. 19 and 0. 20, respectively). Finally, heritability was quite low for the principal component related to <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> (0. 07). Repeatabilities between lactations were about 0. 27 for both latent factors, around 0. 4 for the first principal component and 305 -d yield, and 0. 11 for the second principal component. Moderate genetic correlation among common factors (0. 26) and their high genetic correlation with total lactation yield (> 0. 60) suggest that selection {{can be used to}} change the shape of lactation curve as well as improve yield.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine the suitable non-linear model which most accurately fitted to lactation curves of five lactations in 134 Gir crossbred cows reared in Research-Cum-Development Project (RCDP) on Cattle farm, MPKV (Maharashtra). Four models viz. gamma-type function, quadratic model, mixed log function and Wilmink model were fitted to each lactation separately and then compared on the basis of goodness of fit measures viz. adjusted R 2, root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike’s Informaion Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Results In general, highest milk yield was observed in fourth lactation whereas it was lowest in first lactation. Among the models investigated, mixed log function and gamma-type function provided best fit of the lactation curve of first and remaining lactations, respectively. Quadratic model gave least fit to lactation curve in almost all lactations. Peak yield was observed as highest and lowest in fourth and first lactation, respectively. Further, first <b>lactation</b> showed highest <b>persistency</b> but relatively higher time to achieve peak yield than other lactations.

40|$|<b>Lactation</b> <b>persistency,</b> often simply called persistency, {{in general}} {{can be defined}} as the ability to {{maintain}} yields during the <b>lactation.</b> <b>Persistency</b> has an impact on feed costs, health, and fertility. Of these three components affected by persistency, the impact of persistency on health, i. e. metabolic stress of the cow leading to health problems, may be most important nowadays. Numerous suggestions for criteria of persistency exist. Often simple ratios of part-lactation yields, e. g. the ratio of yield in the first and last 100 days of lactation, have been used. New approaches have used results from the application of random regression test day models developed for the genetic evaluation of yield traits. Many studies have unfortunately neglected the effect of gestation on persistency but acknowledged that an improved persistency should lead to an improved reproductive performance. Both relationships should be considered in genetic analyses and recommendations for improvement of management decisions. Today the correct description of persistency plays a prominent role to obtain correct genetic evaluations based on test day yields. But, although apparently trivial, a direct genetic analysis of <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and even more an inclusion of this trait into selection programmes clearly is a complicated task. A reason for this, amongst others, is that management strategies for feeding during the lactation and handling of the reproductive performance that are most often not recorded, are likely to mask the real persistency. Future studies on the genetics of persistency should also seek a strong interaction of geneticists and physiologists as persistency is fundamentally confounded with the problem of metabolic stress. Today, a recommendation of the inclusion of persistency in selection programmes appears to be premature and more studies, e. g. on the association of persistency with longevity, could aid in this process.

Survival rate increased the relative economic importance of later lactation traits and the first five lactation milk yields during the first 120 months {{from the start of}} the breeding scheme. In contrast, reliabilities of the estimated breeding value (EBV) in later lactation traits are lower than those of earlier lactation traits. We then sought {{to clarify the}} effects of applying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on net merit to improve the reliability of EBV of later lactation traits to maximize their increased economic importance due to increase in survival rate. Net merit, selection accuracy, and HL increased by adding <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> to the selection index whose component traits were only milk yields. <b>Lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> of the second and (especially) third parities contributed to increasing HL while maintaining the first five lactation milk yields compared with the selection index whose only component traits were milk yields. A selection index comprising the first three lactation milk yields and persistency accounted for 99. 4 % of net merit derived from a selection index whose components were identical to those for net merit. We consider that the selection index comprising the first three lactation milk yields and persistency is a practical method for increasing lifetime milk yield in the absence of data regarding HL. Applying SNP to the second- and third-lactation traits and HL increased net merit and HL by maximizing the increased economic importance of later lactation traits, reducing the effect of first-lactation milk yield on HL (genetic correlation (rG) = − 0. 006), and by augmenting the effects of the second- and third-lactation milk yields on HL (rG = 0. 118 and 0. 257, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{dairy cows}} {{throughout}} the world are milked twice daily. In intensive dairying systems, however, {{it is not uncommon}} to increase milking frequency to between 3 and 6 times daily to increase milk production. Reducing milking frequency is much less common; however, once-daily milking of dairy cows, practiced either strategically during certain parts of the lactation or for the entire lactation, is not uncommon in key dairying countries where less emphasis is placed on milk production per cow. The practice fits well with more extensive dairy production systems, particularly those based on grazed pasture. A feature of once-daily milking is that it reduces milk yield by approximately 22 %, depending on stage of lactation, breed, and parity, and it may adversely affect <b>lactation</b> length and <b>persistency.</b> However, it can offer several positive farm management options, especially related to labor requirements and farm working expenses. In addition, it may provide a tool to better manage the metabolism and energy balance of cows during early lactation or during periods of pasture deficit, and it may help to improve reproductive performance and animal health and welfare. Once-daily milking, representing one extreme of the mammary function spectrum, has attracted considerable research interest over the years. Consequently, substantial scientific information is available on its effects on mammary function, at both the physiological and molecular levels.

These data were analysed {{to determine the}} effect of age at first and season of calving on parameters of the Wood lactation curve. Also, genetic trend of the lactation curve parameters in different calving years were evaluated. The results indicate that the highest rate of atypical lactation curve was related to cows that calved in summer (28. 05  %). The maximum phenotypic relationship between initial milk yield and total 305 -d milk yield was observed in cows calved in spring (0. 40). The role of peak yield is more than peak time on 305 -d total milk yield in primiparous Holstein. One month increase in age at first calving from 18 to 26  month raised 305 -d milk yield by around 138  kg and from 27 to 32  month decreased by 61  kg. The <b>persistency</b> of <b>lactation</b> between 101 and 200  days is higher than that of 201 – 305 days.

Solutions were shown to be theoretically equivalent to traditional solutions for this class of random regression models. In addition to the relative simplicity of the proposed method, it allows several other techniques to be applied in the second step: 1) a canonical transformation to simplify computations (uncorrelated regressions) that could make use of recent advances in solution algorithms that allow missing values, 2) a transformation {{to limit the number}} of regressions and to create variates with biological meanings such as <b>lactation</b> yield or <b>persistency,</b> 3) more complicated (co) variance structures than those usually considered in random regression models (e. g., additional random effects such as the interaction of herd and sire), and 4) accommodation of data from 305 -d records when no test-day records are available.

So, persistency is an important trait that must be evaluated with total milk production in Brazilian Gyr cattle. The objective {{of this study was to}} calculate genetic tendency for persistency, accumulated 305 -day milk yield and partial milk yields in first 100, 200 and 300 days in milk of Brazilian Gyr cows using breeding values predicted (EBV) by random regression models. Data was obtained from ABCZ and included 15052 first lactations from cows with calving year ranged from 1980 to 2006. Fixed effects was contemporary group (milking herd, year and season of milk control) and the days in milk were modeled using Legendre polynomials of order 4 for additive genetic and permanent environmental random effects and a heterogeneous residual variance structure using four classes. To estimate breeding values for 305 -day milk yield, the daily EBV were added. To calculate the EBVs for partial periods was made the sum of EBVs daily in the first 100 days (P 100), between 100 and 200 days (P 200) and between 200 and 300 days (P 300) in <b>lactation.</b> <b>Persistency</b> was obtained by the sum of the deviations of EBVs predicted between 30 and 270 days of production in relation to EBV predicted for peak production. The EBV for peak production was calculated using the average EBVs between days 30 and 60 of lactation. The regression for genetic trend <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency,</b> milk yield accumulated 305 -day milk yield and for partial production was calculated by PROC REG of the SAS statistical package, using year of birth as independent variable. Genetic trend for persistency was positive, with a linear regression coefficient of 0. 75 kg/year. For EBV 305, the annual gain was 19. 26 kg of milk/year. For partial productions, annual gains were positive, in 6. 30, 7. 07 and 5. 62 kg per year, respectively, for P 100, P 200 and P 300.  Correlations between EBVs for accumulated yield in different periods of lactation were positive and high. The correlations between persistency and accumulated yield were positive and small in magnitude, getting higher in the final third of lactation, as desired. The analysis show that, over 26 years, the Gyr breed got genetic gain for milk yield, for <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> and effectively higher for P 305. The selection for persistency in Gyr breed should be more intensively applied simultaneously to the selection for milk production in order to provide a better economic profitability. </div...|$|E
40|$|<b>Persistency</b> of <b>lactation</b> in {{indigenous}} and crossbred cows was studied using milk data collected at Bako Agricultural Research Centre. Persistency {{was measured using}} three methods vis a vis as the ratios of milk yield during the second (P 2 : 1) and third (P 3 : 1) 100 days of lactation to milk yield during the first 100 days of <b>lactation,</b> and using <b>persistency</b> index (PI). The overall mean P 2 : 1, P 3 : 1 and PI were 78. 0 ± 0. 67, 59. 2 ± 0. 58 and 85. 7 ± 0. 70 percent, respectively. P 2 : 1 was significantly (P< 0. 01) affected by sire breed, calving season and initial milk yield, while P 3 : 1 and PI were significantly (at least P< 0. 05) affected by sire breed, calving season, calving weight and initial milk yield. Among the sire breed categories, Simmental crosses had significantly the highest P 2 : 1 (86. 7 ± 1. 93 %), P 3 : 1 (67. 9 ± 2. 14 %) and PI (90. 5 ± 1. 65 %) while the Horro had the lowest values of these traits. Cows that calved during Bona (December to February) had the highest P 2 : 1 (88. 2 ± 1. 58 %). The lowest P 3 : 1 (46. 9 ± 2. 22 %) and PI (77. 2 ± 1. 82 °/a) were recorded for cows that calved during Arfasa (March to May). Calving weight was linearly related to P 3 : 1 (b = - 0. 08 ± 0. 02; P < 0. 001) and PI (b = 0. 04 ± 0. 02; P < 0. 05) _ Similarly, initial milk yield was linearly and negatively related to P 2 : 1 (b = L 14 ± 0. 31; P < 0. 001), P 3 : 1 (b = 0. 88 ± 0. 38; P < 0. 05) and PI (b = 0. 65 ± 0. 31; P < 0. 05). All persistency values obtained {{in this study were}} lower for indigenous breeds than crossbreds indicating that these traits were improved through crossbreeding. Persistency was also affected by calving season, calving weight and initial milk yield, which are probably related to the availability of feed. Thus, improving the feeding system through strategic supplementation might improve persistency in both {{indigenous and}} crossbred cows. Besides, due to shorter lactation length of most indigenous cows and for periodic assessment of persistency of crossbred cows to make improvement interventions in the meantime, P 2 : 1 and P 3 : 1 are more appropriate compared to persistency index...|$|R

A estimativa da produção de leite foi realizada em seis intervalos (3 de 21 d e 3 de 42 d), do nascimento à desmama (189 d), por meio da técnica da pesagem do terneiro antes e após a mamada. Os fatores fixos foram ano, prenhez, sexo do terneiro e raça do touro (Hereford e Nelore). A produção de leite diária, do pico de lactação, total e a persistência da lactação, não foram influenciadas pelos fatores estudados (P> 0, 05). O peso ao parto foi maior (P 0, 05) dos demais fatores avaliados. O peso vivo na concepção (99 d média), e à desmama, foi maior nas vacas gestantes (432, 10 ± 5, 78 e 433, 30 ± 6, 36 kg) que nas não gestantes 399, 37 ± 7, 92 e 393, 46 ± 8, 70 kg), respectivamente.

Estimates of milk yield were obtained during six intervals (three 21 d and three 42 d), by the weigh-suckle-weigh technique, from birth to weaning (189 d). Effects studied were year, pregnancy, calf sex and sire breed. None of the effects studied affected (P> 0. 05) milk production parameters: daily milk production, total milk yield, <b>lactation</b> peak and <b>persistency.</b> Body weight at calving was greater (P< 0. 05) in 2001 (417. 49 ± 6. 94 kg) that in 2000 (353. 97 ± 5. 57 kg) and was not affected by the other effects. Body weight at conception (99 d; 432. 10 ± 5. 78 and 399, 37 ± 7. 92 kg) and at weaning (189 d; 433. 30 ± 6. 36 and 393. 46 ± 8. 70 kg), were greater (P< 0. 05) in pregnant cows than in non-pregnant animals, respectively.

40|$|Twelve spring-calving {{and twelve}} winter-calving cows were managed for {{extended}} lactation cycles of 18 -months duration, {{with the former}} group then completing a second extended lactation. Half of the cows were fed according to standard management practice for the herd; the other half received supplementary concentrate from week 9 of lactation onwards. Commencing at the same time, half of the udder of each cow was subjected to increased milking frequency (thrice daily rather than twice daily). <b>Lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> (and hence total milk yield) was significantly increased by frequent milking. Winter calving cows and supplemented cows also exhibited better persistency, but this was only evident up until the point of re-breeding, at around lactation week 33. Milk composition was measured in the spring-calving cows in both their first and second extended lactations. Composition altered {{during the course of}} the lactation, protein and fat percentages increasing and lactose percentage decreasing, irrespective of treatment. The quality of the milk for processing into cheese, fermented products, heat-treated products and cream liqueurs was assessed by calculation of casein number (casein protein as a proportion of total protein). Processing quality declined across the course of lactation in those groups that showed poor persistency but not in those that maintained a persistent lactation. Milk hygienic quality (somatic cell counts) showed parallel changes. Body condition score increased during the course of lactation but was not affected by supplementation; none of the cows became excessively fat. All cows remained healthy throughout the extended lactations and the majority (33 / 36) re-bred successfully. By demonstrating that <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> is plastic and can be improved by simple management interventions, the results lend support to the economic arguments in favour of extended lactation cycles.

40|$|The {{persistency}} of lactation, i. e. {{the ability}} of animals to maintain a rconstant level of production after the lactation peak, represents an interesting trait for animal breeding strategies, allowing for the increase of profitability of animal husbandry via the reduction of production costs. Dairy cattle with flatter curves show a higher reproductive efficiency, a better metabolic status and have their nutritional requirements more constantly spread throughout lactation, allowing {{for the use of}} cheaper feeds (Dekkers et al., 1998; Solkner and Fucks, 1987). Also in dairy sheep the persistency could represent an interesting trait for breeding purposes. A main problem for the introduction of this trait in an aggregate genotype is represented by the difficulty in finding an objective measure: several measurements of <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> have been proposed but none of them is widely accepted (Gengler, 1996) [...] . ...|$|E

Cows without a dry period fattened and spontaneously dried off due to the improved energy availability. Reducing the energy availability in the feed for cows without a dry period did not affect fattening or <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> in late lactation.

40|$|Genetic {{relationships}} between lactation curve traits and Somatic Cell Count are {{of great interest}} for dairy cattle breeding. Factor Analysis (MFA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{can be used to}} extract from the correlation matrix of milk test day records new unobservable (latent) variables that can be related to lactation curve shape. Previous researches report that MFA is particularly able to extract two latent variables related with level of production in early lactation (PEL) and <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> (PERS), respectively, whereas PCA yields a leading component related to the average level of production (AVY) for the whole lactation and a second component negatively related with tests of early lactation and positively with tests of the second part of lactation (SLOPE). Aim of this work was to estimate genetic correlations between lactation curve shape traits and Somatic Cell Score (SCS). MFA and PCA were carried out on a data set of 16, 020 lactations of Italian Simmental cows, each with six TD records for milk yield recorded with the A 4 scheme. Genetic parameters were estimated with a bivariate animal model that included fixed effects of herd-test date, parity*age*lactation stage (only parity*age for lactation curve traits), calving season, and random effects of additive genetic and permanent environment. Heritability estimates were moderate for lactation curve traits (0. 15, 0. 15, 0. 21 and 0. 09 for PEL, PERS, AVY and SLOPE, respectively) and low for SCS (0. 09). Correlations between lactation curve traits and SCS were favourable, i. e. negative, except for the level of production in early lactation. In particular, the genetic improvement of <b>lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> result in a contemporary reduction of SCS (rg - 0. 55 and - 0. 51 with PERS and SLOPE, respectively) whereas the increase of level of production in early lactation can lead to a moderate increase of SCS (rg 0. 13). Finally, the two measures of persistency could be used for different selection strategies: the use of PERS may allow for the increase of persistency together with the total lactation yield whereas the use of SLOPE may result in an improvement of the lactation curve shape without modifying total lactation yield...|$|E

From standard QTL analyses animals with contrasting genotypes ‘Q-’ and ‘q-’ for desired QTLs have been identified for use in functional (transcriptome) studies to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes.

40|$|<b>Lactation</b> <b>persistency</b> (LP) {{has been}} {{neglected}} {{over time in}} genetic evaluations of dairy goats. The main {{reason for this is}} the difficulty to infer about the lactation curve shape. However, some lactations models such as Wood seem to be appropriate to provide persistency estimates under biological viewpoints. The aim {{of this study was to}} fit the Wood lactation model as well as to calculate and evaluate LP as selection criteria in dairy goat breeding programs through genetic parameters estimates. A total of 23, 265 first lactation test day milk yield observations from 900 animals were used. The Wood random regression model was primarily fitted to estimate the lactation curve parameters (a, b and c), and then LP and total milk yield (TMY). Posteriorly, a multi-trait animal model was fitted considering simultaneously LP and TMY. The heritability estimates were 0. 31 and 0. 04 for TMY and LP, respectively. Based on the low LP heritability, selection based only on this trait might be inefficient. In conclusion, the results of this study suggests that selecting for high milk yields might result in high persistency since the genetic correlation between LP and TMY was moderate (0. 39).
