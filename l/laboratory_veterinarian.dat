40|$|Post mortem {{examinations}} {{are important}} for early detection and diagnosis of animal diseases and zoonoses. Over the last ten years, the number of necropsies in livestock has decreased considerably in Switzerland. To counteract this decline, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) launched a project in 2014 called PathoPig. The aim is to evaluate the significance of pathologic-anatomical examinations for early detection of pig diseases and to investigate {{the impact of the}} findings on the improvement of pig health. Pig producers can participate if {{at least one of the}} following criteria is fulfilled: high morbidity and/or high mortality, unusual clinical signs, recurrent problems of unknown aetiology resistant to therapy or increased use of antimicrobials. Accordingly, the veterinarian examines the herd, fills in a standardised anamnesis protocol and submits one to three pigs representing the health problem to a designated pathology laboratory. After post mortem examination, the veterinarian offers specific recommendations to the farmer. Three to six months later, the Swiss Pig Health Service (SPHS) follows up the success of the veterinary recommendations. In 2014, 371 farms submitted pigs for PathoPig. In 84 % of these cases, a conclusive diagnosis was obtained. In 56 % of the cases, gastrointestinal problems were determined, most often (44 %) caused by pathogenic Escherichia coli. In more than 80 % of the cases, the animal health status could be improved considerably after the veterinary consultation.

In the venue of laboratory animal medicine, the use of oxytocin may present confounding variables to research. Although oxytocin has been studied extensively, many of its physiologic effects and interactions with other hormones remain unclear. Investigator concerns about adverse and confounding effects of oxytocin in their research mice prompted the current review of oxytocin and its use to treat murine dystocia. Well-controlled studies of oxytocin in dystocic mice have not been conducted. However, in humans and other animals, inconsistent and adverse effects are well-documented. Limited knowledge of the complex physiologic and molecular mechanisms of action of oxytocin and scant support for the efficacy of oxytocin in dystocic mice fail to meet the standards of evidence-based veterinary medical practice. The administration of oxytocin is contraindicated in many cases of dystocia in research mice, and its use in dystocic mice may be unfounded.

40|$|BACKGROUND Feline {{platelets}} {{are prone}} to clumping after blood collection, rendering the determination of accurate platelet counts difficult for clinical laboratories and resulting in {{a high incidence of}} pseudothrombocytopenia in feline haematology reports. No information is available about the kinetics of platelet aggregate formation in feline ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood and the course of platelet counts over a clinically relevant time period. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine platelet counts in healthy cats over a time period of 24 h after blood collection at 9 time points; to assess potential effects of platelet aggregates, anaesthesia and bleeding conditions on feline platelets and white blood cell counts; and finally, to investigate if glucose concentration is associated with the presence of aggregates. From 30 clinically healthy cats, blood samples were analysed at 9 different time points using two different haematology instruments (using fluorescence and impedance-based flow cytometry) in the counting chamber and by blood smear evaluation. RESULTS Fourteen of the 30 samples were thrombocytopenic at one to 8 time points after collection as analysed on a fluorescence flow cytometry haematology analyser. At the 24 -h timepoint, all thrombocytopenic samples had returned to normal platelet counts. Seventeen of the 30 samples showed platelet aggregates in the counting chamber. Significant differences in platelet counts were associated with the presence and size of aggregates and time since bleeding. No statistically significant differences in counts were found with regard to the quality of blood collection or the use of anaesthesia. Platelet aggregation and, therefore, pseudothrombocytopenia occurred in 57 % of the investigated samples at different time points. CONCLUSION For the first time, deaggregation of feline platelet aggregates could be demonstrated as a reversible effect of platelet aggregation. For clinical <b>laboratories</b> or <b>veterinarians,</b> it may be helpful to rerun feline samples with pseudothrombocytopenia to obtain a more reliable platelet count.

Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms, but progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. Although the causative virus is often transmitted by ticks, animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission also occur. This disease is a particular threat to farmers and other agricultural workers, <b>veterinarians,</b> <b>laboratory</b> workers and hospital personnel.

To minimize the impacts of future events, animal disease surveillance will need to enable prompt event detection and response. Diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance systems targeting domestic animals depend in large part on private veterinarians to submit samples from cases to a laboratory. In contexts where pre-diagnostic laboratory surveillance systems have been implemented, this group of veterinarians is often asked to input data. This scenario holds true in Alberta where private cattle veterinarians have been asked to participate in the Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network-Veterinary Practice Surveillance, a platform to which pre-diagnostic disease and non-disease case data are submitted. Consequently, understanding the factors that influence these veterinarians to submit cases to a laboratory and the complex of factors that affect their participation in surveillance programs is foundational to interpreting disease patterns reported by <b>laboratories</b> and engaging <b>veterinarians</b> in surveillance.

The primers used for the detection of PRRS virus were represented by primers with a specific sequence for the ORF 7 gene of the PRRS virus. More important, the primers attachment process was influenced by punctual mutations of the viral strand belonging to the ORF 7 gene. 114 samples were tested to identify the presence of PRRS virus, genotype I and 14 of them were found to be positive, using OneStep PCR.

Samples were categorized as “positive,” “borderline” or “negative” using our established spectrophotometric cutoff value with the DiroChek® assay when a sample was initially received and processed. Three commercially available heartworm antigen tests (DiroChek®, Witness® HW, and SNAP® RT) were utilized for simultaneous testing of the 150 samples in random order as per their package insert with the addition of spectrophotometric optical density (OD) readings of the DiroChek® assay. Any samples yielding discordant test results between assays were further evaluated by heat treatment of plasma and retesting. Chi-square tests for the equality of proportions were utilized for statistical analyses. Results Concordant results occurred in 140 / 150 (93. 3 %) samples. Discrepant results occurred in 10 / 150 samples tested (6. 6 %) : 9 / 10 occurring in the borderline heartworm (HW) category and 1 / 10 occurring in the negative HW category. The sensitivity and specificity of each test compared to the DiroChek® read by spectrophotometer was similar to what has been reported previously (Witness®: sensitivity 97. 0 % [94. 1 – 99. 4 %], specificity 96. 4 % [95. 5 – 100. 0 %]; SNAP® RT: sensitivity 90. 9 % [78. 0 – 100. 0 %], specificity 98. 8 % [96. 0 – 100. 0 %]). There were significant differences detected when comparing the sensitivities of the SNAP® RT and the Witness® HW to the DiroChek® among the 150 total samples (p =  0. 003) and the 50 “borderline” samples (p =  0. 001). Conclusions In this study, the sensitivity of the Witness® HW was higher than the sensitivity of the SNAP® RT when compared with the DiroChek® test results prior to heat treatment of samples...|$|R
40|$|Rapid, readily available, and {{accurate}} diagnosis of rabies is the keystone of prevention. All surveillance activity and {{description of the}} complex epizootiologic characteristics of rabies in the United States is based on <b>laboratory</b> diagnosis. <b>Veterinarians</b> are {{the first line of}} defense against rabies when responding to clinically ill animals. Rabies is an important consideration when an animal has compatible clinical signs because of the diverse potential sources provided by wildlife reservoirs, such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. Historically, the most imminent threat of rabies exposure to veterinarians and clients originated from domestic dogs. However, rabies in canids has been nearly eliminated throughout most of the United States via vaccination and control of stray dogs. At present, the greatest threat of rabies is among domestic cats, cows, horses, and captive wild animals. Infection with rabies among these animals poses unique risks for exposure of multiple persons, often because rabies is considered late in the clinical course or during postmortem examination. 2 - 5 The standard diagnostic test consists of direct fluorescent antibody (FA) testing of impressions made from fresh brain samples (ie, cerebellum, hippocampus, and brain stem). Fresh brain tissue may not be routinely collected, and this prevents diagnosis with the FA test. If necropsy has been performed, formalin-fixed tissues may be the only available samples. Experimental diagnostic techniques may need to be applied, such as the direct FA test on formalin-fixed material, immunohistochemistry, or polymerase chain reaction assay on paraffin-embedded tissue. 6 Accurate diagnostic capacity and appropriate management of biting animals are essential to the proper handling of potentially exposed animals. In conjunction with local or state health authorities, practicing veterinarians are often directly involved in the 10 -day confinement and observation of biting animals or the euthanasia and submission of brain material for testing. They are also routinely consulted in the management of exposed animals; this consists of a 6 -month quarantine or the euthanasia of native animals and the booster of previously vaccinated animals. A reasonable index of suspicion of rabies among animals with neurologic signs of disease, the preservation of appropriate fresh brain tissue, and demonstrably proficient diagnostic laboratories are essential to the appropriate treatment of potentially exposed humans, as well as identification of at-risk animals for consideration of increased vaccination coverage. 10579039 Infectious DiseaseSurveillance and InvestigationCurren...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} circulating insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), feline pancreas-specific lipase (fPLI) and total thyroxine (TT 4) concentrations and urinary corticoid-to-creatinine ratio (UCCR) as indicators for the prevalence of acromegaly, pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism and hypercortisolism in cats with diabetes mellitus. METHODS Blood and urine samples were collected from diabetic cats treated in primary care clinics in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Standardised questionnaires and physical examination forms provided clinical information from owners and <b>veterinarians.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> testing included serum biochemistry profile analysis and measurement of circulating fructosamine, IGF- 1, fPLI, and TT 4 concentrations and UCCR. CT of the pituitary gland was performed using a multidetector computed tomography scanner. RESULTS Blood samples were available from 215 cats and urine samples were collected at home from 117 cats. Age ranged from 2 - 18 years (median 12 years) and body weight from 2. 7 - 12. 3 kg (median 5. 5 kg). Sixty-five percent of the cats were castrated male and 35 % were female (33 % spayed); 82 % were domestic shorthair cats. Eighty percent of cats received a porcine insulin zinc suspension, 19. 5 % insulin glargine and 0. 5 % a human neutral protamine hagedorn insulin. Thirty-six of 202 (17. 8 %) cats had IGF- 1 concentrations > 1000 ng/ml. Serum fPLI, and TT 4 concentrations and UCCR were increased in 86 / 196 (43. 9 %), 9 / 201 (4. 5 %) and 18 / 117 cats (15. 3 %), respectively. Prevalence did not differ between countries. CONCLUSIONS Hyperthyroidism is rare, whereas increased fPLI concentration, possibly reflecting pancreatitis, is common in diabetic cats. The high UCCR may reflect activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which also occurs in diabetic humans. The percentage of cats with increased IGF- 1 was high but lower than reported in recent studies...|$|R
40|$|The subject I {{was asked}} to think about with you today is raised by a very large change in the focus of {{biomedical}} research. In raw percentage terms, the animals involved in experimentation are now overwhelmingly rats and mice, and, perhaps because they are rats and mice, they are used in large numbers, numbers in thousands {{and tens of thousands}} at some institutions. Legal, ethical, and practical accommodation to this fact on the ground presents a host of questions. There are questions of the cost of care. There are questions of the training of veterinarians, principal investigators, and laboratory personnel. With mice particularly, there are questions about the creation of conditions in an animal that do not yet exist, a future animal, by knocking out a gene and, as we say, 2 ̆ 2 seeing what happens 2 ̆ 2 : new questions, really, that move us away from the traditional focus on the details of how an investigator treats a living animal. Then there are the central questions of weighing costs and benefits, of justification and the application of the three R 2 ̆ 7 s of reduction, refinement, and replacement, where it is not dogs or primates or marine mammals that are concerned, but rats and mice - for many, the least on the scale of concern for animals. Rats, mice, and birds have of course been recently exempted from the Animal Welfare Act. But that may be viewed as making the questions only that much more difficult, thrown back into the laps of researchers themselves and review boards, <b>veterinarians,</b> <b>laboratory</b> assistants, and university and corporate administrators, who for the moment can expect to have that much less outside guidance or mandate in deciding what to do. And I think {{it is fair to say}} that lying behind particular responses to questions and resolutions of issues is a newly pressing, overarching problem, which is how to think about rats and mice, not a new problem at all, but newly pressing...|$|R
