This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series.

5|$|Grant and Hayes {{had both}} {{advocated}} civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation.

Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained <b>loyal</b> <b>and</b> supported Garfield.|$|E

Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Lansdale had {{security}} {{concerns about the}} head of the weapons laboratory, J.

5|$|Warlock were {{starting}} to make a solid reputation in the US, when {{the taste of the}} audience for classic metal acts shifted in favor of grunge, leaving the singer's mission to conquer the American market incomplete.

5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not <b>loyal,</b> <b>and</b> were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Harclay was richly {{rewarded for}} his <b>loyal</b> <b>and</b> {{competent}} performance at Boroughbridge. On 15 March he was created Earl of Carlisle, and promised lands worth 1000 marks yearly. Yet Harclay, {{who had turned}} down Lancaster's overtures {{to join in the}} rebellion, was no great adherent of the King. As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably <b>loyal</b> <b>and</b> devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E

Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E
