25|$|Orchiectomy or DES or {{both were}} the {{standard}} initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the GnRH agonist <b>leuprolide</b> {{was found to}} have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985.|$|E
25|$|A third key {{aspect of}} {{management}} is suppression of central precocious puberty {{if it has}} begun. The usual clues to central puberty in boys are that the testes are pubertal in size, or that testosterone remains elevated even when the 17OHP has been reduced toward normal. In girls central puberty is less often a problem, but breast development would be the main clue. Central precocious puberty is suppressed when appropriate by <b>leuprolide.</b>|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as <b>leuprolide</b> to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will want or need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or <b>Leuprolide</b> Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|E
2500|$|GnRH {{action can}} be {{interrupted}} {{in one of}} two ways. GnRH antagonists such as abarelix and degarelix suppress the production of LH directly by acting on the anterior pituitary. GnRH agonists such as <b>leuprolide</b> and goserelin acetate suppress LH through the process of downregulation after an initial stimulation effect which can cause initial tumor flare. In order to prevent stimulation of tumor growth during the initial LH surge, an antiandrogen such as cyproterone acetate is prescribed a week before and three weeks after GnRH agonists are given. [...] Abarelix and degarelix are examples of GnRH antagonists, whereas the GnRH agonists include <b>leuprolide,</b> goserelin, triptorelin, and buserelin. Initially, GnRH agonists increase the production of LH. However, because the constant supply of the medication does not match the body's natural production rhythm, production of both LH and GnRH decreases after a few weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Dynamic Assessment Following GnRH-a Administration (GAST). This test {{measures}} {{the change in}} serum estradiol levels between cycle day two and three after administration of one mg of subcutaneous <b>leuprolide</b> acetate, a gonadatropin releasing hormone agonist. [...] Patients with estradiol elevations by day two followed by a decline by day three had improved implantation and pregnancy rates than those patients with either no rise in estradiol or persistently elevated estradiol levels.|$|E
2500|$|It can be {{difficult}} to become pregnant with PCOS because it causes irregular ovulation. [...] Medications to induce fertility when trying to conceive include the ovulation inducer clomiphene or pulsatile <b>leuprolide.</b> [...] Metformin improves the efficacy of fertility treatment when used in combination with clomiphene. Metformin is thought to be safe to use during pregnancy (pregnancy category B in the US). A review in 2014 concluded that the use of metformin does not increase the risk of major birth defects in women treated with metformin during the first trimester.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, Charles B. Huggins {{published}} {{studies in which}} he used estrogen to oppose testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer. This discovery of [...] "chemical castration" [...] won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The role of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in reproduction was determined by Andrzej W. Schally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. GnRH receptor agonists, such as <b>leuprolide</b> and goserelin, were subsequently developed and used to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues such as <b>leuprolide</b> acetate (Lupron), {{which last}} longer and have fewer side-effects, {{are also used}} to reduce libido, as are {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The evidence for these alternatives is more limited and mostly based on open trials and case studies. All of these treatments, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "chemical castration", are often used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy. According to the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, when treating child molesters, [...] "anti-androgen treatment should be coupled with appropriate monitoring and counseling within a comprehensive treatment plan." [...] These drugs may have side-effects, such as weight gain, breast development, liver damage and osteoporosis.|$|E
50|$|A Phase III, randomised, 12 month {{clinical}} trial (CS21) in prostate cancer compared androgen deprivation {{with one of}} two doses of degarelix or the GnRH agonist, <b>leuprolide.</b> Both degarelix doses were at least as effective as <b>leuprolide</b> at suppressing testosterone to castration levels (≤0.5 ng/mL) from Day 28 to study end (Day 364). Testosterone levels were suppressed significantly faster with degarelix than with <b>leuprolide,</b> with degarelix uniformly achieving castration levels by Day 3 of treatment which was not seen in the <b>leuprolide</b> group. There were no testosterone surges with degarelix compared with surges in 81% of those who received <b>leuprolide.</b> Degarelix resulted in a faster reduction in PSA levels compared with <b>leuprolide</b> indicating faster control of the prostate cancer. Recent results also suggest that degarelix therapy may result in longer control of prostate cancer compared with <b>leuprolide.</b>|$|E

50|$|Such {{conditions}} may {{be treated with}} drugs with antiandrogen actions, including androgen receptor antagonists such as cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and bicalutamide, 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, CYP17A1 inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues such as <b>leuprolide</b> and cetrorelix, and/or other antigonadotropins such as megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|E

50|$|Cyclophosphamide {{has been}} found to {{significantly}} increase the risk of premature menopause in females and of infertility in males and females, the likelihood of which increases with cumulative drug dose and increasing patient age. Such infertility is usually temporary, but can be permanent. The use of <b>leuprolide</b> in women of reproductive age before administration of intermittently dosed cyclophosphamide may diminish the risks of premature menopause and infertility.|$|E
50|$|GnRH {{agonists}} are synthetically {{modeled after}} the natural GnRH decapeptide with specific modifications, typically in position 6 (amino acid substitution), 9 (alkylation) and 10 (deletion). These substitutions inhibit rapid degradation. Agonists with two substitutions include: <b>leuprolide</b> (Lupron, Eligard), buserelin (Suprefact, Suprecor), histrelin (Supprelin LA, Vantas), goserelin (Zoladex), and deslorelin (Suprelorin, Ovuplant). The agents nafarelin (Synarel) and triptorelin are agonists with single substitutions at position 6.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include leuprorelin (<b>leuprolide)</b> and goserelin, {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} vaginal atrophy {{is usually the}} normal {{decrease}} in estrogen {{as a result of}} menopause. Other causes of decreased estrogen levels are decreased ovarian functioning due to radiation therapy or chemotherapy, immune disorder, removal of the ovaries, entering the post-partum period, and lactation. Various medications can also cause or contribute to vaginal atrophy, including tamoxifen (Nolvadex), danazol (Danocrine), medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera), <b>leuprolide</b> (Lupron), and nafarelin acetate (Synarel). Vaginal atrophy can also be idiopathic.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{treatment is}} with anastrozole. Histrelin acetate (Supprelin LA), triptorelin or <b>leuprolide,</b> any GnRH agonists, may be used. Non-continuous usage of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). However, when used regularly, GnRH agonists cause a decreased release of FSH and LH. Prolonged use has a risk of causing osteoporosis. After stopping GnRH agonists, pubertal changes resume within 3 to 12 months.|$|E
50|$|Transgender youth are a {{specific}} target population of puberty blockers. Children {{as young as}} two or three can exhibit signs of being transgender, and may qualify {{for the use of}} puberty blockers. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (e.g., <b>leuprolide</b> acetate, histrelin) to halt puberty, can be used for transgender youth before the development of natal secondary sex characteristics. Puberty blockers' effects are completely reversible, which alleviates controversy on the usage of puberty blockers for young children.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{different}} medicines, LHRH agonists and antagonists, which both lower the amount of testosterone made by the testicles. They work inhibiting the formation of LH in the pituitary gland. The LHRH agonists produce a sudden increase on levels of testosterone followed by a huge falling, process called flare, whereas LHRH antagonists decrease directly the amount of testosterone. Some {{of the most common}} LHRH agonist and antagonist active substances are <b>leuprolide,</b> goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin and degarelix.|$|E

50|$|Medical {{treatment}} has not proven consistently effective. Medical regimens have included tamoxifen, progesterone, bromocriptine, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist <b>leuprolide,</b> and testosterone. Gestational macromastia {{has been treated}} with breast reduction drugs alone without surgery. Surgical therapy includes reduction mammaplasty and mastectomy. However, breast reduction is not clinically indicated unless at least 1.8 kg (4 lb) of tissue per breast needs to be removed. In {{the majority of cases}} of macromastia, surgery is medically unnecessary, depending on body height. Topical treatment includes regimens of ice to cool the breasts.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, {{the first}} human {{experiments}} with CPA began by measuring serum levels after oral administration, rates of spermatogenesis, and hair growth in women. Starting in 1972, psychiatrists trialed [...] "sexually deviant" [...] persons with CPA. In 1973, CPA was first approved in Europe, under the brand name Androcur. Until the development of <b>leuprolide,</b> CPA {{was one of the}} few drugs used to treat precocious puberty. CPA was first marketed in combination with EE as an oral contraceptive in 1978 under the brand name Diane.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{a benign}} tumour {{and does not}} 'invade' the {{neighbouring}} tissue, it {{has a tendency to}} recur after surgical excision so it is termed as aggressive. The recurrence can be as close as six months from initial resection. It will not be surprising to find cases coming to tertiary medical centers with history of having a labial mass (sometimes misdiagnosed as gartner's cyst) and have multiple surgical excisions from various doctors. There is no proven medical therapy and people have tried various sorts of chemotherapy like Tamoxifen, <b>Leuprolide</b> and even full blown chemotherapy.|$|E

50|$|Antiandrogens {{are used}} in more severe cases. Similar to {{physical}} castration, they work by reducing androgen levels, and have thus been described as chemical castration. The antiandrogen cyproterone acetate {{has been shown to}} substantially reduce sexual fantasies and offending behaviors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (such as <b>leuprolide</b> acetate) have also been used to lower sex drive. Due to the side effects, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommends that hormonal treatments only be used when there is a serious risk of sexual violence, or when other methods have failed. Surgical castration has largely been abandoned because these pharmacological alternatives are similarly effective and less invasive.|$|E
