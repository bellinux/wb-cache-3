5|$|Wholesale {{reform of}} Oxford {{examinations}} {{began in the}} late eighteenth century, proposed by, among others, Brasenose's John Napleton in his pamphlet Considerations on the Public Exercises for the First and Second Degrees in the University of Oxford. It was Cleaver and his successor Frodsham Hodson that would continue the reforms and apply them to Brasenose itself. Cleaver was from the minor gentry and set out from the start to make Brasenose the place of rich men. Unable to secure the <b>librarianship</b> of the Bodleian whilst fellow, he had instead become tutor to his patron George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham – a position which he used to lead two of the Duke's sons {{and other members of the}} family to Brasenose; the sons' uncle, Baron Grenville, became the University's Chancellor. Under his leadership into the early nineteenth century, numbers improved dramatically and so did the class of people coming: Brasenose began to be dominated by gentlemen like the Egertons, the Grenvilles, and of Richard Rainshaw Rothwell I. Its income over doubled between 1790 and 1810 to £9,200 per annum, with the college maintaining its links to the north-west. Among the other acquisitions of Cleaver was the services of Hodson, a Liverpudlian.|$|E

25|$|Nhu {{completed}} a bachelor's degree in literature in Paris and then studied paleography and <b>librarianship,</b> {{graduating from the}} École Nationale des Chartes, an archivists' school in Paris.

It had been conceived in the 1930s by Catholic progressives such as Emmanuel Mounier. Mounier's heirs in Paris, who edited the left wing Catholic review Esprit denounced Nhu as a fraud. Personalism blamed liberal capitalism for the Great Depression and individualistic greed and exploitation, and disagreed with communism due to its opposition to spirituality.|$|E

500|$|Although Lenin {{was not an}} enthusiast for avant garde art, the Vkhutemas {{faculty and}} {{students}} made projects to honor him and further his politics. Ivan Leonidov's final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a Lenin Institute of <b>Librarianship.</b> Vladimir Tatlin's Monument to the Third International was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg. Furthermore, Lenin's Mausoleum was designed by faculty member Aleksey Shchusev. Alexei Gan's book Constructivism, published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting constructivism with the revolution, and Marxism. The founding decree included a statement that students have an [...] "obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses". These examples help justify the school's projects {{in terms of the}} early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school's existence.|$|E
500|$|One of Larkin's {{colleagues at}} Hull said {{he became a}} great figure in post-war British <b>librarianship.</b> Ten years after the new library's completion, Larkin {{computerized}} records for the entire library stock, making it the first library in Europe to install a GEAC system, an automated online circulation system. Richard Goodman wrote that Larkin excelled as an administrator, committee man and arbitrator. [...] "He treated his staff decently, and he motivated them", Goodman said. [...] "He did this {{with a combination of}} efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion." [...] From 1957 until his death, Larkin's secretary was Betty Mackereth. All access to him by his colleagues was through her, and she came to know as much about Larkin's compartmentalized life as anyone. During his 30 years there, the library's stock sextupled, and the budget expanded from £4,500 to £448,500, in real terms a twelvefold increase.|$|E
