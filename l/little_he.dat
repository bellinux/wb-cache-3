5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was <b>little</b> <b>he</b> had wandered in the dark woods of Sm√•land imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, though he could use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E

5|$|Rush {{was unique}} in early Australian {{sculling}} {{in that he}} provided opportunities for others to compete and excel, by organising regattas and other rowing events, though financially he gained <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> raised and raced horses, organised athletic carnivals, and was a generous supporter of charities, churches, and schools. His background {{as the son of}} Irish tenant farmers, a class traditionally debarred by law from owning land and hence accumulating wealth, gave Rush little understanding of the management of money. Rush and his wife had fourteen children, and the Rush family lived in grand, if not extravagant style; most Rush enterprises were financed by mortgages or promissory notes. When the Banks Crash of 1893 came, Rush was not only deeply in debt, he did not even own the house he lived in.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan. Lonergan was the writer of both of the previous productions, The Actor's Children and St. Elmo. This release marked the first comedy release of a scenario written by Lonergan and also the first comedy produced by the Thanhouser company. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He {{was the most important}} script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers attributes the director of the production to Lloyd B. Carleton, the stage name of Carleton B. <b>Little.</b> <b>He</b> would direct a number of films for the Thanhouser Company before moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers also credits Blair Smith as the cameraman.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in Mission Control. He would have been lead flight director on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was <b>little</b> <b>he</b> could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how <b>little</b> <b>he</b> earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E
25|$|With {{few options}} left open to him, Rebus decides {{to talk to}} Morris Gerald Cafferty at his {{upmarket}} home in Duddingston. The two men's mutual loathing results in a tense confrontation. While Cafferty reveals relatively <b>little,</b> <b>he</b> does admit that the Robertson Brothers {{used to work for}} him as 'general employees', but left his service years ago. As Rebus leaves, he is certain that Cafferty was behind the attack on Michael.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Konstantin {{was furious}} when Alexander III {{restricted}} {{the title of}} Grand Duke to only children and grandchildren of Emperors, as this meant that Konstantin's grandchildren would merely be princes, but there was <b>little</b> <b>he</b> could do. He had been shunned from society and Alexander III only called his uncle to court for the wedding of Konstantin's eldest granddaughter, Alexandra of Greece to his nephew Grand Duke Paul.|$|E

25|$|Evers {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut against Northamptonshire in early July 1936, making 35 and 33. He kept {{his place in}} the side for a while thereafter, but except for 38 against Surrey and 56 against Warwickshire he achieved <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> played only once in 1937, but made four appearances the following year, standing in as captain on the last three of those occasions in the absence of usual captain Charles Lyttelton.|$|E
25|$|Spruance was {{an active}} man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were {{generally}} simple. He never smoked, and drank <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance {{spent most of his}} retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} blow to {{the franchise}} came in , though, with {{the start of the}} World Hockey Association. Long dissatisfied with how <b>little</b> <b>he</b> was paid as the league's marquee star, Bobby Hull jumped to the upstart Winnipeg Jets for a million-dollar contract. Former Philadelphia Flyers star Andre Lacroix, who received very little ice time in his single season in Chicago, joined Hull, and the pair became two of the WHA's great stars. The Hawks repeated their appearance in Cup Final that year, however, again losing to Montreal. Stapleton left for the WHA too after that year, depleting the team further.|$|E

25|$|Hostilities {{commenced}} on 24 July. Tryon was of {{the view}} {{at the outset that}} there was <b>little</b> <b>he</b> could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness. They had to continuously maintain station outside his ports, while he and his men enjoyed the Irish countryside. They suffered the difficulties of communicating while at sea whereas Tryon could simply use the telegraph. Albert Markham commanded the blockader's squadron of cruisers, whose job was to stay close to Berehaven, watch for ship movements and attack anyone who emerged, while the ironclads stayed further away.|$|E
25|$|Trey Johnson {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Jackson, Mississippi. His father, Clinton Jr., and his older brother, Will, played college {{baseball}} for Jackson State University. He followed his father footsteps and started playing baseball since he was <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> then started to play basketball during his teenage years. However, he only played basketball intermittently through middle school and high school. He attended Murrah High School and played both basketball and baseball there. He starred as a pitcher during high school and after graduating, he was selected in the 30th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals. However, he opted to attend college and play collegiate sports before turning pro.|$|E

25|$|When Henry {{tried to}} divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter. As such, he {{appeared}} on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, {{he was ready to}} die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how <b>little</b> <b>he</b> feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.|$|E
25|$|In John Allen Muhammad's May 2006 {{trial in}} Montgomery County, Maryland, Lee Boyd Malvo {{took the stand}} and confessed to the 17 murders. He also gave a more {{detailed}} version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive psychological counseling, admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial where he had admitted to being the trigger man for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this {{in order to protect}} Muhammad from a potential death sentence, and because it was more difficult to obtain the death penalty for a minor. Malvo said that he wanted to do what <b>little</b> <b>he</b> could for {{the families of the victims}} by letting the full story be told. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, Kemp-Welch was a {{right-handed}} batsman {{often used}} as an opening batsman and a right-arm fast bowler; his bowling in first-class cricket was largely confined to {{his first two years}} at Cambridge. Having left school, he played in three matches for Warwickshire as a 19-year-old in May 1927, batting low in the order and bowling very <b>little.</b> <b>He</b> did not play again in that season, but in February 1928 {{he was a member of}} an amateur-led tour to Jamaica under Lionel Tennyson that played three first-class games against the Jamaica side and although his highest score on the tour was only 38, he batted consistently and ascended the batting order, opening the innings in the final game. He again played a few matches for the Warwickshire side in the 1928 season.|$|E
