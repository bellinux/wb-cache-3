40|$|Organizational {{effectiveness}} {{is related to}} both effective leadership styles and to having leaders with secure attachment styles. Transformational and charismatic leaders often have secure attachment styles. However, the relationships between insecure attachment styles and leadership styles remain unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether insecure attachment in leaders (fearful, preoccupied, and dismissing attachment styles) is related to transformational, charismatic, transactional, and <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership.</b> A quantitative, non experimental approach was taken in this study. Participants included those in leadership positions (college deans, chairpersons, and provosts) (n = 18) and instructors (subordinates) (n = 36) from local community colleges and universities. Attachment style was measured using the Relationship Questionnaire, and leadership behavior was measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and the Servant Leadership Questionnaire. As expected, transformational and charismatic leadership styles were significantly correlated with secure attachment style, and charismatic leadership was negatively correlated with fearful attachment. Dismissing attachment style was significantly positively correlated with <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership.</b> Attachment styles also significantly predicted charismatic and laissez-faire leadership styles. The results of this study may help organizations as they make hiring and training decisions.

The Statistical population involved all the academic staff members and Heads of the Departments at the university (N = 118). Based on the nature of subject and research questions, correlation method was thought to best serve the purpose of the present study. To collect the data, Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS) and Bass and Avolio Multifactor Leadership Style Questionnaire (MLQ form 5 X) were used. For data analysis, Pierson correlation and multiple regression in enter way were used. The Results indicated high satisfaction on the part of the majority of the members about the performance and leadership style of the Heads of the Departments. Also, transformational style was found to be of high prevalence among the Heads of the Departments. Furthermore, prediction of variables with the use of multivariate regression indicated that only the use of emotional subscale can predict the transformational and <b>Laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership</b> styles, but the use of emotional, emotional regulation and assessment and expression of emotions (p< 0. 01) can predict the transactional leadership styles. In the study of the relationship between variables, it was found that a positive correlation exists between transformational leadership style and emotional intelligence (p< 0. 05) has negative correlation between transactional leadership style and emotional intelligence (p< 0. 01), but not significant relationship between <b>Laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership</b> style and emotional intelligence was found.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the last}} 35 years, a free market, <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> program has {{increasingly}} dominated perceptions {{as to what}} constitutes correct economic theory and policy. Most adherents of this program trace its origins to Adam Smith, and claim that its dominant position {{is the result of}} superior theory. The argument here is that Adam Smith is not the theoretical ancestor of modern <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> economics, and that there are fundamental differences between Smith’s position on <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> and that of conventional neoclassical theory. A difference between “soft ” and “hard ” <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> is made, where Smith represents the former position; neoclassical theory the latter. Further, and more important, it is argued that the current <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> program is an outgrowth of a political program instituted in the 1930 ’s and financially supported in the present era by conservative foundations to promote an ideological framework that permits the development of specific governmental (and non-governmental) actions...|$|R

40|$|Leadership {{refers to}} '… {{the ability to}} {{influence}} a group toward the achievement of goals' (Robbins, 2003). It is a social, goal-oriented process that involves the articulation of a collective vision that gives purpose, meaning and guidance; appealing to the ideological values, motives and self-perceptions of followers (House, 1995). Strong leadership {{is seen as a}} main ingredient for the success of organizations when it directs the effective use of human capital towards achieving organizations’ mission and goals (Globe, 1972; Wu and Shiu, 2009). There has been {{an increase in the number}} of public and private higher education institutions in Malaysia. The leading universities in the country are currently facing unique challenges as well as continual environmental change, as they attempt to meet the human resource demands from various industries. At the same time, universities have been asked to reexamine their roles in nation-building. In context, effective leadership is a key issue. Effective leadership plays a vital role in leading universities through change as this often involves ambiguity, uncertainty and risks. Where there is poor leadership, employees may be reluctant to change as they view change as a threat rather than an opportunity to their career. Strong leadership, complemented by effective administration of resources is therefore necessary to support change. Existing literature on leadership is mainly based on private organizations in Western countries. Comparatively fewer researches on leadership have been undertaken in context of higher education institutions in developing countries like Malaysia. Hence, there is a lack of knowledge on the preferred leadership styles of Malaysian employees in the public higher education sector. In response, this study aims to assess the perception of academics in the public higher education sector on the leadership styles of leaders in their universities. It attempts to assess academics’ preferences for transformational, transactional and <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership</b> styles, as well as identifying the demographic characteristics of academics which are significantly related to their leadership style preferences...|$|E

Diverging interests among Irishmen led to contradictory demands that meant nationalist unity became wishful thinking. These differences became a problem because some Irishmen dogmatically demanded conformity. They rejected Redmond 2 ̆ 7 s inclusive policy as insufficient support.

40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between leadership and follower attitudes such as organisational commitment and job satisfaction {{has been well documented}} in previous research, no prior research has explored {{the relationship}} between Full-range Leadership of franchisees and their followers' motivation. By exploring {{the relationship between}} Full-range Leadership and the motivation of employees in the under-researched area of telecommunication franchising, the study fills a gap in the literature. Additionally, this research discovered the factors affecting the application of a particular leadership style (transformational, transactional or laissez faire). A multiple case study research of twenty franchisees of 02, located in the north of England was conducted. A qualitative research methodology utilised data from secondary sources and semi structured interviews with franchisees and their subordinates. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 6 s) was used alongside semi structured interviews; this led to a more in depth consideration of the seven Full-range Leadership factors. This study selected 180 -degree format by interviewing franchisees and their subordinates. Data was analysed with the use of NViv 08 to identify the most important themes and patterns from the data collected. The research showed that transformational leadership has a stronger relationship with motivation than transactional leadership. The <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> <b>leadership</b> style was absent amongst the franchisees under study. The research also illustrated that franchisees who exhibited a transformational style, empowered their staff more and made their followers less dependent on the leader. A practical application and observable behaviour of transformational leadership can be found in behaviours such as delegating significant authority to individuals, developing follower skills and self confidence, creating self-managed teams, providing direct access to sensitive information, eliminating unnecessary controls, and building a strong culture to support empowerment. In transactional leadership, leader follower relationships were based on a series of exchanges or bargains between leaders and followers. Franchisees that had a transactional leadership style used contingent reward to motivate followers. Transformational franchisees and their followers indicated that idealised influence had the strongest impact on motivation. Empirical evidence suggested that transformational leadership factors (idealised influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation and individualised consideration) had a stronger relationship with motivation than transactional leadership factors (contingent reward and management - by-exception). This study identified that several factors influenced the application of a particular leadership style: individual followers, situations, organisational performance and targets, organisational culture and franchisor's policies and procedures. Other motivational factors, besides the leader's leadership style, have been taken into consideration in this research. This study found that, in particular, monetary motivators were used in the sales driven environment of 02 -franchise business to motivate followers. The findings supported the literature review in confirming that transformational franchisees used non-monetary rewards in addition to monetary rewards: giving a sense of achievement by appreciating and praising people's efforts, recognition by giving vouchers and awards, social events and competitions.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{purposes}} of this study are to first investigate various leadership and management styles of Catholic secondary school principals and their impact on school discipline and secondly to determine whether there is a correlation between leadership and management styles of secondary school principals and discipline in the school. The rationale behind the research topic is that the researcher has realised that many black public schools in South Africa are dysfunctional and cannot deliver quality learning and teaching. The reason for this sorry state of affairs is historical and well known. Most of these schools, to make the transition from dysfunctional to effectiveness, do not require courses in the market. What they require, and it is sorely missing, is strong and effective leadership. The role of a principal in a school is crucial. The success of the process of restoring the culture of teaching and learning rests to a large extent on the principal. This is mainly because he/she is the one who has to lead the entire school community in implementing whatever plans and programmes are to be put in place. Teaching is like riding a wild horse. Even though you're in the saddle it sometimes feels as if you're only barely in control and, if you stop paying attention for just one second, you will end up in the mud. One of the greatest challenges that teachers face when starting out in their careers is learning how to deal with unruly and badly behaved learners so {{that the rest of the}} class can get on with the lesson. Teachers often say that they are not paid to discipline learners they are paid to teach them. However, without discipline there can be little learning. Without discipline education is not possible. Discipline is the very foundation on which education should seek to build. Many of our secondary schools are still in crisis today because discipline is undermined. In Chapter one the problem to be researched, the statement of the problem and the purpose of study, general assumptions of study and definitions of terms were introduced. Chapter two examined the literature available. That was done to expand upon the context and the background of this study and to further define the problem and provide an empirical basis for the development of the hypothesis. Chapter two also examined the Leadership Traits theory, the Situational Contingency theory, the Pathgoal theory, Collaborative, Democratic or Participative leadership styles, Autocratic leadership style, <b>Laissez</b> <b>Faire</b> <b>leadership</b> style and leadership according to Gospel values. The Democratic and Situational contingency leadership styles were singled out as the styles of leadership applied most often in a number of organisations. Leadership according to Gospel values will be the most suitable, especially for principals in Catholic schools. It is very much intertwined with the democratic leadership style. There was strong evidence from the literature studied that these styles, if properly applied, can go a long way in helping the principals of schools to live up to the challenges they are facing in education. It is these leadership styles coupled with an understanding of transformation issues in education such as: new principles and values of education systems in South Africa; teaching and learning as the main aims of the education and management, self-reliant schools (self-managed), governance, building schools as learning organisations, and certain skills that could enable principals to be effective leaders in their schools. In order for principals to provide proper and effective leadership, they should be competent in the following aspects: • Stakeholders' involvement in the management of schools • the use of different leadership styles as propounded by the Situational Contingency Theory • team work, and • effective and efficient communication with stakeholders. Chapter three examined the overview of Catholic Education in South Africa, The distinctive Religious character of the Catholic school, Characteristics of a Catholic school, school discipline and how poor school discipline can be prevented and a model for effective discipline in a school. It also focused briefly on the impact of the South African Schools Act No 84 of 1996 and the Bill of Rights as enshrined in the Constitution of South Africa on school discipline. In Chapter four the research methodology was examined. This included the structuring of the questionnaire to try to get factual information, opinions and attitudes about the problem. The questionnaire focused on the following: • stakeholders' involvement in management tasks • the leadership and management styles of principals • how the principal is perceived by stakeholders • communication with stakeholders • teamwork • parental involvement and • how discipline in the school is perceived by stakeholders. The questionnaire was then administered to all educators, members of the school governing bodies, members of the Representative Council of Learners and principals of all Secondary Catholic schools in Limpopo. Chapter five deals with data analysis, interpretation, findings and recommendations. In conclusion, of all the leadership styles discussed, the Situational Contingency, and emerging participatory democracy and leadership according to Gospel values appear to be the most appropriate styles of leadership in South African Education today. The three leadership styles are like rosebuds in that they bring forth positive results but also have associated thorns and dangers. If we can locate the thorns, then we can learn how to hold the flower without injury. Different leaders and managers adopt different styles of leading and managing their organisation (school). As a result there is no single perfect leadership or management style. It is, however, important that leaders must be able to weigh and consider ensuing or confronting situations and circumstances and to adapt accordingly. Good educational establishments require disciplined environments. Teachers, parents and students need clear strategies and guidelines that encourage learning. They need to ensure that learning is well structured and orderly. Good relationships need to be maintained in learning institutions to improve motivation and raise the quality of education for all...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between emotional intelligence (EI), leadership styles and outcomes of leadership, within the workplace environment of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK; which is endemic with change (Allen, 2009; Iles & Cranfield, 2004). The broad question posited is: Within the context of change, {{what is the nature}} of the association between EI, leadership styles and leadership outcomes, from the perspective of both leaders and their followers? There is a dearth of published research on EI and leadership within the context of change which makes this study particularly timely. The study employs two different models of EI that have evolved from ‘ability-based’ (Palmer & Stough, 2001; Mayer & Salovey, 1997) and ‘personality-based’ (Bar-On, 1997; Higgs & Dulewicz, 2002) theoretical perspectives. This is the first substantive study to have embraced both models and the intention here was to identify similarities and differences between the two perspectives in the context of organisational change leadership. Although there is extensive research on leadership, there still exists an acute need for EI and leadership research based on follower perspectives (Lindebaum & Cartwright, 2010; Notgrass, 2010). This study addresses this gap by investigating both leader self-perceptions and follower-perceptions of their leaders. This study has been conducted in two phases. Phase 1 focuses on leader self-perceptions. Phase 2 focuses on the combination of leader self-perceptions and follower-perceptions of their leaders. In Phase 1, this thesis postulates that within dynamic environments such as the NHS, different types of linkages can be argued between EI and the different leadership styles (Transformational Leadership, Transactional Leadership and Laissez Leadership) while suggesting that EI will predict Transformational Leadership. Furthermore, this thesis postulates that EI and Transformational Leadership will have a positive impact on leadership outcomes. In Phase 2, this thesis considers both leader and follower perspectives and identifies leaders who overestimate, underestimate or are in-agreement with followers, in evaluating their own Transformational Leadership capabilities. Based on this, the leaders are classified into self-other-agreement categories of overestimators, underestimators, in-agreement/good and in-agreement/poor leaders. Thereafter, this thesis postulates varying levels of leader EI and Outcomes of Leadership (depending upon their self-other-agreement categories) as adjudged by their followers. Similar differences across the self-other-agreement categories of the leaders are predicted in terms of the linkage between EI and Transformational Leadership as perceived by the followers. The ontology of this research is realist and the epistemology is positivist (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Data has been collected in two phases - from leaders in the NHS and then their reporting staff. Phase 1 target population was identified as NHS staff in leadership positions involved in implementing change management initiatives. Phase 2, target population was identified as the direct reports of phase 1 participants. Phase 1 entailed purposive judgment sampling followed by random sampling. Phase 2 adopted convenience sampling. Both phases were completed through surveys. In phase 1, leaders completed a self-report of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT) and the Higgs & Dulewicz Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (EIQ). The Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale has been employed to check for possible response bias. Self developed research items were employed to obtain information regarding the extent and nature of the respondents’ involvement with change. Leaders, who consented to participate in phase 2, identified 3 to 5 reporting staff for participation. In phase 2, reporting staff completed rater-forms of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and the EI 360 degree questionnaires. A number of qualitative interviews have been conducted with leaders to obtain contextual data regarding the nature of the changes, impacting upon the lives of NHS staff. Phase 1 findings based on self-ratings of leaders indicated a strong positive relationship between EI and Transformational Leadership, and between EI and one factor of Transactional Leadership (contingent reward). Contrary to the hypothesis, a negative relationship was found between EI and <b>Laissez</b> <b>Faire</b> <b>Leadership.</b> Regression analysis revealed that both the EI models significantly predicted Transformational Leadership. Furthermore, both EI and Transformational Leadership demonstrated a strong positive relation with Outcomes of Leadership. This study also reports higher Transformational Leadership scores for females and higher EI scores for females according to one of the Swinburne University EI model. Supplementary findings showed that; while predicting Transformational Leadership, the Higgs and Dulewicz EI model had incremental predictive validity over the Swinburne University EI model. Phase 2 findings based on follower perceptions confirmed the postulation that overestimators demonstrate lower EI and Outcomes of Leadership than other leader categories. Underestimators were perceived as manifesting higher EI and higher Outcomes of Leadership. The link between leader self-ratings of EI and follower-ratings of their leaders’ Transformational Leadership across the self-other-agreement categories was also examined. Findings supported arguments that EI and Transformational Leadership will be significantly associated for overestimators but not for underestimators. Some contradictory results were generated for the in-agreement/good/poor categories in terms of EI and Transformational Leadership correlations. These contradictory findings may be attributable to the difference in the factorial constitution and psychometric properties of the two EI models. More research is also recommended on the in-agreement sub-categorisation of focal leaders as good/poor. This study provides empirical evidence suggesting that EI predicts Transformational Leadership, effective in the context of change. EI also positively correlated with aspects of Transactional Leadership, helpful in successfully leading change. Therefore, investing in training and development of leaders’ EI has the strong potential improve the ability of change leaders. Underestimators were rated by followers as the highest on EI and Outcomes of Leadership, while overestimators were adjudged as the lowest on EI and Outcomes of Leadership. Therefore, underestimating leaders are arguably most suited to effectively lead dynamic change, as in the NHS. Female leaders manifested higher Transformational Leadership and also higher EI on one of the EI models. This provides some justification to enhance leadership responsibilities of women within transformational environments like the NHS. The clear indication that high EI predicts Transformational Leadership and high EI relates to lower Laissez-Faire Leadership can have recruitment and selection implications favouring the appointment of individuals with high EI in the NHS facing endemic change. However, there is a need to exercise caution and not simply use EI measures alone for placements and recruitment/selection. Nonetheless these results and the measures of EI and leadership could be beneficial in self development, career counselling and other social contexts in the National Health Services...|$|E

For this purpose, the study utilized the categories of transformational, transactional <b>leadership</b> and <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> style, with a sample of 96 managers of small companies in northern Chile. The results obtained show that, in the organizations studied, transformational leadership is moderate, whereas the transactional style is frequent and <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> style is infrequent. Similarly, with regard to the effects of leadership on the effectiveness of the small companies analyzed, it was found that transformational leadership has a positive impact on performance, whereas transactional <b>leadership</b> and <b>laissez</b> <b>faire</b> style had a negative impact...|$|R
