But these matters did not take up all his time, {{and the rest of}} it hung heavily on his hands. He mooned about the place until he was tired. He tried to occupy himself in his garden, but it was weary work sowing crops for strange hands to reap, and so he gave it up.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{pairs of}} contronyms are true homographs, i.e., {{distinct}} words with different etymology which {{happen to have}} the same form. For instance cleave [...] "separate" [...] is from Old English clēofan, while cleave [...] "adhere" [...] is from Old English clifian, which was pronounced differently. The King James Bible often uses [...] "let" [...] in the sense of [...] "forbid", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb lettan 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning [...] "allow", which is derived from the Old English verb lǣtan 'leave, allow, <b>let</b> <b>on</b> <b>lease</b> (etc.)'. Still, the alternate meaning of [...] "let" [...] can be found today in the legal phrase [...] "without let or hindrance" [...] and in ball games such as tennis, squash, table tennis, and racquetball.|$|E

50|$|Development of {{the area}} north of the Marylebone Road around Dorset Square {{continued}} after 1815, and to the North West in Lisson Green, workers’ cottages were built from 1820 to 1840. Many of the original Georgian houses north of Portman Square were redeveloped as mansion blocks, which were <b>let</b> <b>on</b> long <b>leases.</b> This development spread along the major traffic routes of Edgware Road and Baker Street.|$|R
50|$|In 1535, {{the clear}} yearly {{value of the}} house was £317 4s. 1d. Of this sum £128 16s. 7d. was drawn from the rectories of Sempringham with the chapel of Pointon, Stow with the chapel of Birthorpe, Billingborough, Horbling, Walcote, Loughton, Cranwell, Norton Disney, Kirkby, Laythorpe, and Hacconby, in Lincolnshire; Whissendine in Rutland; Fordham in Cambridgeshire; Thurstanton in Leicestershire; and Buxton in Norfolk.

Six granges appear to have been farmed by bailiffs for the monastery and the rest were <b>let</b> <b>on</b> <b>lease.</b> The demesnes of Sempringham were worth £26 13s. 4d. a year. In the hands of the crown bailiff four years later, the property brought in £383 5s. 5d.|$|E
50|$|Shiv Mandir — The Mandir is {{situated}} on the southern bank of a beautiful tank, now <b>let</b> <b>on</b> <b>lease</b> to the Government for pisciculture, with a lovely hillock at the hack and a giant Pimpal tree in the front. The inner shrine or 'Gabhara' of the temple is 5.945 m.2 (8' x 8') with Ling occupying the central position. The Ling is donned with a brass plaque. On the wall facing the visitor are engraved the images of innumerable deities in beautiful and attractive designs. Outside is the 'Mandap' of the temple enclosed on all the four sides with walls having a single entrance in the front. It is used to deliver Kirtans and hold religious discourses in praise of the God. To {{the south of the}} temple of Shiv there is a temple of Maruti whose image is about 3.048 meters (10 ft) tall. The idol of Maruti has become the major attraction to the people. The Pimpal tree protects under its shade one more Shivling and an image of Nandi both carved out of black stone. The natural surroundings like the tank, the hillock and the Pimpal (tree provide an excellent setting and add charm and beauty to the temple. Especially the evenings, at the time of sunset, are lively and pleasant. It has become a good spot of recreation.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 {{a second}} gift of 104 acre and the {{following}} year another 143 acre for endowment to be <b>let</b> <b>on</b> building <b>leases</b> to create income {{to help with the}} park's upkeep. Together these new gifts made a total area of 477 acre within Cornwall Park.

50|$|These {{include the}} Wardrobe, Trumpeters' House and the Gate House, {{all three of}} which are Grade I listed. The Gate House was built in 1501, and was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a 65-year <b>lease</b> by the Crown Estate Commissioners in 1986. It has five bedrooms.|$|R
25|$|The Black Death {{seems to}} have brought the priory to a {{particularly}} low ebb. When Prior Richard le Warde died in 1349, Nicholas de Cumpton had to be appointed in his place as {{he was the only}} other monk in the community. In 1354 the ageing Bishop Northburgh wrote denouncing poor property and financial management: the priory had neglected woodland and fences and <b>let</b> land <b>on</b> <b>leases</b> that were too long. In 1361, when Prior William del Ree died, there was again only one other monk, Henry of Kidderminster, who became the new prior.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, spurred {{partly by}} the local vicar and partly by Thomas Cubitt, the builder and developer, whose yards were across the river in the still marshy and undeveloped area of Pimlico, a bill was {{submitted}} to Parliament to form a royal park of 320 acres. The Act was passed in 1846 and £200,000 was promised {{for the purchase of}} the land. The Commission for Improving the Metropolis acquired 320 acres of Battersea Fields, of which 198 acres became Battersea Park, opened in 1858, and the remainder was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> building <b>leases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{houses were}} <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 99-year <b>leases,</b> {{and apart from}} {{modernisation}} from time to time, appear to have remained unchanged during this period. The 1862 Ordnance Survey, for example, shows {{that none of the}} houses had been extended over the gardens, and annual directories record good tenancies with no obvious gaps during which major works might have been undertaken. Most of the 18th-century houses in Hans Place were substantially rebuilt by Cadogan Estates when new leases were arranged in the late 19th century, adopting a style that became so closely associated with the district that Osbert Lancaster dubbed it “Pont Street Dutch”.|$|R

50|$|The Cornewall family {{occupied}} Moccas until 1916 when Sir Geoffrey Cornewall, the 6th Baronet, {{moved to}} a smaller house on the estate, after which the house was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a long <b>lease.</b> After death of Sir William Cornewall, the 7th Baronet in 1962, the estate passed to the Chester-Master family who owned the house until 2013. They undertook a programme of restoration and modernisation and offered luxury guest accommodation.|$|R
50|$|A Methodist Society {{began in}} Halstead in 1811, and the Wesleyan chapel {{was built in}} 1813 <b>on</b> land <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a 99-year <b>lease</b> by T. Sikes esq. for a nominal 3 peppercorn rent. The chapel was {{enlarged}} in 1852, and a plaque on the front marks a further extension in 1866. It was renovated internally in the late 1980s. In the 19th century {{it was part of}} the Stamford and Rutland Circuit. It is now in the Leicester Trinity Methodist Circuit.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 the Inner Temple {{bought the}} {{neighbouring}} 1-2 Serjeant's Inn, {{which can be}} accessed directly from the Inner Temple, {{with the intention of}} converting it to barristers' chambers. However, instead, the premises has been <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a 99-year <b>lease</b> to Apex Hotels. No. 3 Serjeant's Inn has been a barristers' chambers, occupying commercial premises, since 1986. Mitre Court, which connects the Inner Temple area, Serjeant's Inn and Fleet Street, is occupied as barristers' chambers, residential flats and more recently, solicitors.|$|R
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase <b>leases</b> <b>on</b> the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 99-year <b>leases,</b> as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|R
50|$|The {{houses on}} the {{south-western}} side of the Green include Maids of Honour Row. The houses, and their gates and railings, at numbers 1-4 Maids of Honour Row are Grade I listed. The Wardrobe and the Gate House, both Grade I listed, are surviving structures from Henry VII's Richmond Palace. The Gate House was built in 1501, and was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a 65-year <b>lease</b> by the Crown Estate Commissioners in 1986. The Trumpeters' House, which is also Grade I listed, is an early 18th-century house built {{on the site of}} Richmond Palace's Middle Gate.|$|R

50|$|The estate's origins {{are in the}} 16th {{century when}} the bishops of Bangor sold {{property}} belonging to their manor, Maenol Bangor. The estate was developed during that century by the Williams family. It passed to the Crown on the death without issue of Sir William Williams in 1696. In 1723 it was presented to John Smith of Tedworth, and passed to his nephew Thomas Assheton Smith I in 1762. Assheton Smith was the 3rd largest landowner in Gwynedd. This area of Wales {{is known for its}} slate production, and the Assheton Smiths profited from slate quarrying, and owned the Dinorwic Quarry, which made a profit of £30,000 in 1856. Even after farms were <b>let</b> <b>on</b> long <b>leases</b> to encourage good tenant behaviour, slate was the family's main economic interest. The Assheton Smiths extended their estate through enclosure, despite strong opposition from local farmers, including the enclosure of existing properties at Gallt-y-foel.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "rest area" [...] is not {{generally}} {{used in the}} United Kingdom. The most common terms are motorway service areas (MSA), motorway service stations, or simply motorway services. As {{with the rest of}} the world, these are places where drivers can leave a motorway to refuel, rest, or get refreshments. Most service stations accommodate fast food outlets, restaurants, small food outlets such as Marks and Spencer and coffee shops such as Costa Coffee; many service stations also incorporate motels such as Travelodge. Almost all the MSA sites in the UK are owned by the Department for Transport and <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 50-year <b>leases</b> to private operating companies. However, in December 2008, after a change in the law, the only current official [...] "rest area" [...] in the UK was created at Todhills, on the newly opened section of the M6 between Carlisle and the Scottish border.|$|R
5000|$|When the Prince became King George IV in 1820 {{he moved}} to Buckingham Palace. Instructions were given in 1826 to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests that [...] "Carlton Palace" [...] should be given up to the public, be {{demolished}} and the site and gardens laid out as building ground for [...] "dwelling houses of the First Class". By 1829 the Commissioners reported that the site was completely cleared and {{that part of it}} had already been <b>let</b> <b>on</b> building <b>leases.</b> Materials from the demolition were sold by public auction, with some fixtures transferred to Windsor Castle and to [...] "The King's House, Pimlico". Columns of the portico were re-used in the design for the new National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, interior Ionic columns were moved to the conservatories of Buckingham Palace, and some of the armorial stained glass was incorporated in windows of Windsor Castle.|$|R
2500|$|In 1840 the Priory site's owner (a farmer called John Coleman) let the {{south-eastern}} {{parts of}} the enclosed site was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a building <b>lease</b> to Parker Ayres. This damaged the remaining buildings but fortunately, between 1845 and 1847, the local cleric Dr. F.C.Plumptre had already noted everything he possibly could about {{the foundations of the}} original buildings. [...] His reconstruction suggests that the builders probably created Effingham Street along the site of the dormitory, chapter house and transepts, Effingham Crescent along what might have been the reredorter, and Saxon Street and the houses and gardens of the north side of St. Martin's Hill along what was once the nave of the church.|$|R
50|$|In 1583 a draper called John Phillips bequeathed {{the rental}} income from {{a house in}} Woodstock to employ a {{schoolmaster}} in Kidlington. His bequest did not provide for a schoolhouse, so a tenement called Church House was used. In 1759 the school had to close because the house in Woodstock had decayed {{to the point that}} it was unfit to be let. In 1766 the house was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a repairing <b>lease</b> to George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough and between 1774 and 1778 the school reopened. The vicar and Sir James Dashwood, 2nd Baronet were the governors, and it seems that subsequently the Dashwoods as well as the Phillips endowment supported the school.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the impacts of VAT on municipal economy, to determine when it is advisable for a municipality to become a VAT payer and how the VAT payership affects the municipalitys income, and what the associated rights and obligations are. Based on an analysis, we review Municipality "X that registered for VAT voluntarily on July 1, 2004 and Municipality "Y that only became a VAT payer beginning January 1, 2009. According to the information revealed, the VAT registration associated financial benefits for Municipality X were closely connected with its financial investments made {{with the assistance of}} received subsidies and capital investments into property. Compared to Municipality X, the implications are that Municipality Y would have not benefited from becoming a voluntary VAT payer. The anticipated financial effect would have been neutral. At present, we can state that the greatest financial benefits for municipalities under the VAT scheme arise from investments into the renovation, repairing work or construction of water-supply and public sewer systems provided that the municipality operates or <b>lets</b> it <b>on</b> <b>lease</b> to another VAT payer...|$|R
50|$|Parker Homestead State Park is {{a former}} Montana state park located in southeastern Jefferson County, near Three Forks, Montana in the United States. It is eight miles (13 km) west of Three Forks on Montana Highway 2. The park is just 1 acre in size and serves to {{preserve}} a sod-roofed log cabin that {{was built in the}} early 1900s. The cabin is very similar to many of the first homes built by the settlers of frontier Montana. In a cost-saving measure, the Montana state park commission <b>let</b> its <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the park expire on January 1, 2010 and the homestead reverted to private ownership.|$|R
50|$|In March 1991 the {{remaining}} breweries {{were sold to}} Courage (subsequently sold by Foster's to Scottish & Newcastle) in a deal that pooled 8,450 pubs as the jointly-owned Inntrepreneur Estates Company. Inntrepreneur had to have 4,350 tied pubs {{by the time the}} Beer Orders took effect, which led to many being sold and fewer being <b>let</b> <b>on</b> free-of-tie <b>leases.</b> In September 1993, 1,654 Chef & Brewer pubs were sold to Scottish & Newcastle (subsequently bought by Heineken). 1,750 pubs were sold in 1995 for £254m to Nomura as Phoenix Inns in one of the first securitisation deals, and in May 1996 a further 1,410 pubs were transferred to Spring Inns with a view to a similar sale. In the end Inntrepreneur and Spring were both sold to Nomura for £1.2bn in September 1997 to clear the way for the Guinness deal. This left Nomura with 4,400 pubs They created the Unique Pub Co for the 2,600 pubs that had signed the controversial SupplyLine agreement; {{the remaining}} 1,100 Voyager pubs were free-of-tie, earmarked for disposal or were the 400 locked in legal disputes over SupplyLine.
