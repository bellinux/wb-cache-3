40|$|The studies {{reported}} here used an interference paradigm {{to determine whether}} a long-term consolidation process (i. e., one lasting from several hours to days) occurs in the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> two implicit motor skills, <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a movement sequence and <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a visuo-motor mapping.

The amount of time between the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the two skills varied for different subjects. In both the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a movement sequence and the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a visuo-motor mapping, we found that remote memories were susceptible to interference, but the passage of time did not afford protection from interference.

This is a complex task where the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> one predicate definition should be interleaved with the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the other ones in order to discover predicate dependencies. To overcome this problem we propose {{a variant of the}} separate-and-conquer strategy based on parallel <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> different predicate definitions. In order to improve its efficiency, optimization techniques are investigated and adopted solutions are described. In particular, two caching strategies have been implemented and tested on document processing datasets. Experimental results are discussed and conclusions are drawn. ...|$|R

Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{compared the}} <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> lower-dimensional family resemblance categories (4 dimensions) with the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> higher-dimensional ones (8 dimensions).

Contrary to these predictions, the experiments showed no slower <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> high-dimensional categories; instead, subjects learned more features from high-dimensional categories than from low-dimensional categories. This result obtained both in standard learning with feedback and in noncontingent, observational learning.

40|$|We {{study the}} learnability of several {{fundamental}} concept {{classes in the}} agnostic <b>learning</b> framework <b>of</b> Haussler [Hau 92] and Kearns et al. [KSS 94].

Together with the parity <b>learning</b> algorithm <b>of</b> Blum et al. [BKW 03], this gives the first nontrivial algorithm for agnostic <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> parities. We use similar techniques to reduce <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> two other fundamental concept classes under the uniform distribution to <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> noisy parities.
