5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's {{limited use}} of the apartment <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw little reason to move them across the province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular {{use of the}} apartment.|$|E

5|$|After , {{the road}} bent {{back to the}} east, leaving the {{woodlands}} behind as it passed south of the Miner Institute. The research complex <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> stretch of isolated homes along NY191, centered on the route's interchange with the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY191 entered the hamlet of Chazy, a small community located on the Little Chazy River. The route bypassed most of Chazy, skirting {{the northern edge of}} the hamlet as it headed northeast to a junction with US9. NY191 ended here while CR23 follows the state-maintained US9 south into downtown Chazy.|$|E
5|$|Six episodes were {{performed}} and recorded at the Paris Theatre and aired weekly between June 2 and July 7, 1990. The {{success of the}} first series <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> two being commissioned. The second series aired from May 11 to June 15, 1991, and the third from July 11 to August 15, 1992. The first series was made available by BBC Enterprises on a two-cassette release in 1991, but {{the second and third}} series were not.|$|E
5|$|The Central {{line station}} opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve {{congestion}}. Further congestion <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of}} the New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, including cross-platform interchange with the Bakerloo line.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> ambiguity in defining a planet: {{the point at}} which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} months of Nayyouf's {{sentence}} were served in Sednaya Prison outside Damascus. While at Sednaya, Nayyouf tried {{to organize a}} prisoner revolt. He was moved to Palmyra prison near Tadmur. In 1993, Nayyouf went on a thirteen-day hunger strike at Palmyra in order to protest the torture of prisoners. While at Palmyra, Nayyouf was able to pass evidence that the prisoners were being tortured to the press outside, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> transfer to Mezzeh prison, a military prison outside Damascus. Most of his ten-year sentence was spent in solitary confinement in Mezzeh.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

5|$|In May 1455, Northumberland was {{travelling}} {{with the}} king and Somerset to a great council at Leicester, when the party was intercepted by York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the First Battle of St Albans, the royal forces clashed with the forces loyal to the Duke of York, {{in what has been}} described as the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. The battle was a complete victory for the Yorkist side, and <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> reversal of the political situation. The king was taken captive, and Somerset was killed. Northumberland was also among the casualties, and was buried at the nearby St Albans Abbey. A suggestion made by a contemporary chronicler, and supported by modern-day historians, said that the true purpose of the battle was to settle personal scores. Once York and Salisbury had killed Somerset and Northumberland respectively, the battle was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|In week 12, in {{what would}} turn out to be a preview of Super Bowl XXI, veteran {{defensive}} end George Martin (at 34 the oldest player on the team) intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown before being tackled from behind in the end zone by a celebrating Lawrence Taylor. Then in the final two minutes of the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19–16 in front of 75,116 fans at Giants Stadium. With the victory the Giants completed their second five-game winning streak of the season, several of them in close contests; the margin of victory in those five games was 7, 3, 3, 2, and 3 points.|$|E
5|$|Internally at Rare, the Stamper {{brothers}} were demanding bosses {{who continued to}} work 15-hour days after transitioning into management roles. Chris Stamper continued to code for the company through the mid-90s, while also serving as Rare's chairman and technical director. Tim, the managing director, continued to work on graphics for the company, including backgrounds in Donkey Kong Country. Their younger brother, Stephen, also worked as Rare's operations director. The Stampers encouraged competition between the company's development teams and {{were involved in the}} decision-making on every game, even when the company expanded to several hundred employees. A group of employees left in 1997 to work for another Sony-focused studio, while another group left during production for the sequel to GoldenEye. Despite decent reviews, Rare's subsequent games did not appear to meet the high standards of their predecessors, and poor sales <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> staff exodus.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene {{to agree to a}} three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused her attention to the Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> truce in 798, on terms similar to those of 782.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{escalated}} in September 2003, when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. In {{the match}} Vieira was shown a second yellow card {{for his part}} in an altercation with striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, and during stoppage time, defender Martin Keown brought down Diego Forlán in the Arsenal penalty area. United were awarded a penalty and Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take it, but his shot rebounded off the crossbar. This was followed by scenes of jubilation from the Arsenal players, who confronted Van Nistelrooy after his miss and the resulting scuffle <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> fracas after the final whistle. The FA immediately took action, charging six of Arsenal's players (Jens Lehmann, Ray Parlour, Lauren, Cole, Keown and Vieira) with improper conduct. The club was fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA at the time. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the season came {{in a game against}} the Minnesota Vikings in November. Trailing Minnesota 20–19 late in the fourth quarter in the Metrodome, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate fourth and 17 pass to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory. The following week, veteran defensive end George Martin intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown. Then in the final two minutes of the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19-16. In a Monday night encounter at San Francisco the next week, the Giants overcame a 17–0 halftime deficit to Joe Montana's 49ers en route to a 21–17 victory.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a spread}} offense scheme {{implemented}} by first-year head coach Todd Dodge, the Mean Green experienced some offensive success; however, defensive woes {{led to a}} 1–7 record through the first eight games of the season. In a rivalry game against SMU on September 8 Mean Green quarterback Daniel Meager threw for over 600 yards (one of the top 20 single-game performances in FBS history), but defensive errors and an interception returned for a touchdown during the fourth quarter <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> loss. After losing to the Arkansas Razorbacks 66–7, Dodge replaced Meager with redshirt freshman Giovanni Vizza. After four games as a starter, Vizza had set a new passing record for freshmen at North Texas. Coming into the game, the Mean Green ranked 12th nationally in passing offense. Dodge's defensive squad, however, continued to struggle; the team had allowed an average of 209 yards of rushing per game, ranking 107th {{in the nation in}} rushing defense. It also ranked 119th in scoring defense, allowing opponents to score an average of 46.5 points per game. Coming off a bye week, the team entered the game with a 1–7 record.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{learning}} of the Russian victory at Chashniki, Napoleon ordered Victor to immediately attack Wittgenstein again and recapture Polotsk. [...] This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> yet <b>another</b> French defeat, the Battle of Smoliani, on November 14, 1812.|$|R
