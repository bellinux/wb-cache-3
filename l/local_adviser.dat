The {{purpose of this study}} was to collect information about the conditions, opportunities, problems and needs of teachers at the beginning of their career and to assist in the development of services to them. National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966 - 1967 (SN: 66031, 66032, 66033, 67032, 67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of probationary teachers and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN: 14 Probationary Teachers, 1968 - 1969 and SN: 15 Probationary Teachers, 1969 - 1970. The phasing of the enquiry followed the timetable: Spring 1966 : Survey of Directors of Education in the 162 LEA's in England and Wales (SN: 66031) June 1966 : Survey of Head Teachers (SN: 66032) Sept 1966 : First survey of probationers (SN: 66033) March 1967 : Oral interviews with sub-sample of probationers (SN: 67032) May 1967 : Follow-up questionnaire to probationers who responded to first questionnaire (SN: 67033) SN: 14 includes two questionnaires (A 1 and B 1) distributed to probationers in one rural and three urban areas in July 1969. These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project. SN: 15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable: Sept 1969 : Questionnaire A 2 and B 2 to all probationers Sept-Oct 1969 : Questionnaire C 1 to those attending induction conference Oct-Dec 1969 : Questionnaire C 2 to those attending discussion meetings Jan-June 1970 : Questionnaire C 3 to those at optional topics courses July 1970 : Questionnaire C 4 to those at overview conference July 1970 : Questionnaire C 5 to all probationers July 1970 : Questionnaire A 3 to all probationers (Questionnaire A 1, A 2 and A 3 were essentially identical, B 1, B 2 and B 3 completely identical.) The questionnaires therefore measured both response to various course programmes and discussion meetings, and the overall effect of such courses on the professional judgements, opinions and actions of probationary teachers. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions In this follow-up questionnaire sent to teachers nearing the end of their probationary year (see SN: 66033 for first questionnaire), information was collected in six categories: 1. Training Background: after two introductory questions on whether the probationer has had any teaching practice in the type of school in which now teaching and whether an opportunity found to discuss progress or career with a tutor either from own College or from a local College, a series of questions establishes in fine detail the respondent's views of training in the light of new experience of teaching, concerning, for example, the proportion of time spent on various subjects (dealing with both subject content at student level and with subject teaching methods and student learning processes) and on teaching practice work; the various aspects of the general life and atmosphere of the training college or department which are felt to have helped or hindered the settling-down process during the present year, and overall opinion on training he received for becoming a teacher with suggestions for ways in which it might be improved. 2. Appointment and Placement: whether LEA was first, second or third choice; whether probationer has changed schools during present year or intends to change within next two years, plus reasons for such changes. 3. Guidance for Teachers in Their First Year of Service: whether respondent has been invited to, and has attended, any induction course or meeting specifically arranged for probationary teachers; whether respondent is aware of, has attended or plans to attend any courses for teachers in general in the area; whether probationer has met or been visited in school by any Local Authority Inspector or Adviser, or the HMI for the district, and whether respondent is aware of the way in which own progress is being assessed and to whom, and in what form this assessment will be reported at the end of the year. The probationers are also asked which areas, from a given list of 13 areas, they have discussed or would like to discuss with a <b>Local</b> <b>Adviser,</b> Inspector or HMI or would like to discuss with someone outside school who is not one of these officials. 4. Teaching Data: any changes in size, age-level or ability-level, age-range, ability-range or time-table content of probationer's class/es during probationary year; reason for such changes; ways in which, and reasons why, probationer has changed approach to teaching since beginning of probationary year from a list of 8 possible changes; whether respondent is now more or less confident in discipline and relationship with children; and three major problems respondent feels to be particularly relevant to own present situation from a list of 13. 5. School Community: whether respondent feels more at ease with duties and colleagues than at beginning of year; whether contribution to out of school activities has altered in any way; attitude to teaching atmosphere of school; relationship to standards of teaching at school; to staffroom conversation and discussions about work and to teaching methods of colleagues. Respondent is also asked whether opportunity has been available for discussion of work and problems and whether would welcome more or less advice from either officials or unofficial advisors. Probationer is also asked to choose three most important problems (from list of 11) in respect of school community life. 6. Personal Data: number of weeks lost through illness during first term; general state of health compared to previous year; whether changes in health can be attributed to new role as full-time teacher; any full- or part-time work or study respondent is engaged in and nature of this; plans for study towards further professional or academic qualification during next five years; comparison by respondent of own work as teacher with that of friends with equivalent educational background and of same age (in respect of 13 different characteristics - social prestige, security, intellectual stimulation, physical conditions, salary and salary prospects, etc.). Several questions elicit information on the respondent's plans - whether plans to stay in education, job expects to be doing in five year's time, and reasons for either staying in education or moving to a new field. Three major personal problems are chosen from a list of 8 and a final question asks for comments on ways in which respondent feels entry into profession could have been made easier.

30|$|Finally, DRR {{activities}} {{also need}} to {{take place at the}} local level, where hazards hit. For instance, training <b>local</b> <b>advisers</b> and representatives of local communities is critical in order to increase their understanding of seasonal forecasts, and to foster their capacities to raise awareness among their communities. The benefits of using relevant climate information at the local level, for example for agriculture, have been highlighted in many studies (Archer 2003; Hansen et al. 2011; Ngugi et al. 2011). A two-way dialogue between climate experts and local communities (or their representatives) should be launched to build trust and respect. Trust could be gained, for instance, if existing local knowledge and observations of climate and seasonal patterns are perceived and used as valuable information for the production of forecasts. After all, local villagers are long-term witnesses of their environment and its changes (Campbell 1999; Speranza et al. 2009; Baudoin et al. 2014). Other opportunities include improving communication means, for example, using cellphone to better disseminate climate information and warnings in remote areas where such devices are frequently used (Glantz and Baudoin 2014).|$|R

40|$|In Sweden, energy-consulting services, here {{referred}} to as local energy advising (LEA), have traditionally contributed to improving household energy efficiency. The aim {{of this article is}} to analyze the development of this service from the 1970 s, when the consultancy came into being, to the present day, through a review of documents and published literature. The analysis enables the understanding of the evolution of local energy advising as a policy instrument, and provides valuable insights for the future. Local energy advising has often been subsidized by the Swedish government and used as a state policy measure rather than a municipal one. As a policy measure, the function of the service has changed over time. In the early period, the oil crisis was a fact and the <b>local</b> <b>advisers</b> were used to inform households. In the 1980 s, however, the task of energy-advising was taken over by the energy companies in the spirit of market liberalization. In the 1990 s, Sweden became a member of the European Union, and the emphasis was put on general information campaigns. Recently, the development of decentralized energy systems (including micro-energy systems) has necessitated targeting individuals with information. One important lesson to learn from the historical development of LEA is the imperativeness of providing energy advising at the local rather than the state level for better efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This book {{collects}} together significant {{research on}} the involvement of parents and carers in their children’s education. The findings {{stress the importance of}} dialogue and action between teachers and parents so parents can actively share in the decisions about their children’s educational experience. The contributors explore the challenges this presents for both the teachers and the parents. Participatory democracy at grass roots level is hugely complex, especially in diverse society. This book seeks to develop the empirical and theoretical understanding of parent-school relationships and participatory democracy. Studies of aspects of this problematic dynamic provide approaches for constructive policy and practice. New research into home-school relations, for example, will support teachers in developing their strategies for securing parent participation. Key factors that affect parents’ participation are identified, such as the experiences of mothers, and issues relating to social class and race, and these inform what the parents’ role in school should be. What is feasible, what is appropriate and what is desirable? Parent Participation offers some answers. The book is for teachers, policy makers, school governors, and for <b>local</b> authority <b>advisers,</b> councillors and practitioners. It is also important reading for students of teaching, child development, social policy, sociology, and gender studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Attack of {{potatoes}} by Rhizoctonia solani {{has been a}} serious problem in Sweden for a long time. Earlier work with this disease in the country was focussed on chemical and alternative treatments of seed tubers. The aim of the work presented here is to investigate the occurrence of soil infestation and incidence of various anastomosis groups under various crop rotations and soil types in various regions of Sweden. The study started in 2003 and is still ongoing. It is financially supported by the Swedish Farmers Association for Agricultural Research, SLF. With the help of <b>local</b> <b>advisers,</b> soil samples are collected from fields {{with a history of}} R. solani attacks. Samples are taken from three spots of 25 m 2 in each field and the positions of the spots are registered on maps or by GPS, thus making repeated sampling from the same spot possible. The rotations, soil type, pH etc. is well documented for each field. The soil infestation has so far been analysed by means of minitubers as a catch crop. After thorough mixing of the soil it has been distributed in pots wherein the tubers have been planted. After around two months in the dark at + 10 °C and watered as needed, the occurrence of stem canker and sometimes black scurf on the seed tuber has been registered. The cause of injury has been validated by observations under magnification where the mycelium of R. solani is visible and by putting small pieces of canker tissue on artificial media. R. solani infestation has been found in Swedish soils at levels high enough to cause damage on potato plants grown under conditions extremely favourable for attack of the pathogen. The pathogen was detected most frequently in soil samples collected from fields where potatoes were grown the previous year. The proportion of positive samples progressively declined with increasing numbers of years without potatoes. No evident pattern regarding influence of specific crops in the rotations on the decline of infestation has been found. However, {{in the northern part of}} the country, there were very few positive samples compared with the southern part at a similar time span to potato crops. Possible reasons for this will be discussed. In 2006, a collaboration with SCRI in Scotland (Alison Lees) has started aiming at comparing three different methods for detection of R. solani soil infestation: minitubers or Quinoa seeds as catch crops, where the DNA from the latter will be analysed at SCRI, or direct analysis of DNA from soil (quantitative PCR at SCRI). Another goal, achieved simultaneously, is to confirm the occurrence of R. solani AG- 3 in Sweden. It is also of interest to investigate the prevalence of other anastomosis groups. This will be done when easily handled methods are available. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

40|$|The post-authoritarian period {{provides}} the socio-economic and political {{context within which}} good governance and democratic institutional building {{has taken place in}} Indonesia. As strategic actors in governance processes, intellectuals have significant roles in such institutional building. My thesis will uncover the socio-political role of intellectuals in East Java province, especially Surabaya, by utilising a political economy and political sociology analysis. The contribution of intellectuals to local governance processes and democratic politics in East Java is achieved not only through their roles as knowledge-producers and disseminators, but through their actions as participants in the struggle over power and wealth, as members of electoral campaign teams, <b>local</b> government <b>advisers</b> as well as propagandists. East Java intellectuals eased into taking up these roles because there had been no space for creating social bases for progressive forces in civil society under New Order authoritarianism. Hence, there was a strong tendency for East Java intellectuals to have been domesticated or co-opted into the structures of state corporatism. After the fall of Suharto and subsequent democratization, predatory forces previously incubated under the New Order have not been sustained through coercion only but also by hegemonic strategies carried out by an intellectual apparatchik, including academicians, journalists and NGO activists. Because democratic institutions have been dominated by politico-business alliances in national as well as in local political arenas, the practice of governance tends to be dictated by predatory interests, serving neither the cause of the free market nor of empowering ordinary people. The thesis shows that intellectuals play a role beyond producing or disseminating ideas. In fact, various kinds of intellectuals have become directly involved in practices that ensure the mutation of the good governance agenda associated with decentralisation and democratisation into yet another instrument of predatory rule, including at the local level...|$|R

40|$|Teachers are {{entering}} deputy headship and then {{deciding not to}} become headteachers. This is a double problem for the profession. Firstly, potential headteachers are being lost to that role, and secondly, career deputies block the route to headship and prevent ambitious deputies from getting that essential management experience that will effectively prepare them for headship. In Bromley, where this study was carried out, some deputies are getting good advice and support from their headteachers, are given real leadership development opportunities and are going on to become effective headteachers. However, some deputies are given low grade tasks and do not receive the support and encouragement from their headteachers that will lead them towards headship. Finally, there are some deputies who, although in a supportive environment, have decided that headship is not for them. Initially, a short survey of all primary schools in Bromley was conducted to gain an overall picture of deputy headship in Bromley. All schools were contacted {{to find out whether}} the deputy at the school was interested in becoming a headteacher at some stage in the future. During a period of twelve weeks, eleven primary headteachers were interviewed together with a senior <b>Local</b> Authority <b>adviser.</b> The aim of the work was to gain a picture of the state of deputy headship in one London Borough and establish what experiences and opportunities were given to deputy headteacher to prepare them for headship. This inquiry found that the majority of deputies in Bromley {{did not want to be}} headteachers and that their preparation experiences differs greatly from school to school. The study suggests that deputies should be given the opportunities and experiences that will prepare them for headship. Information from the literature review, the survey and interviews are analysed to construct a model for effective preparation for headship and to make recommendations for improved practice.

40|$|The {{achievement}} of sustainable agriculture, economically viable, socially equitable, environmentally sound {{and capable of}} providing sufficient amounts of food in both quantity and quality for a population is a major challenge of agricultural research. In Guadeloupe, a French overseas territory located in the Caribbean, agriculture is currently facing some difficulties for reaching food self-sufficiency. Crop production weakly covers {{the needs of the}} population and consumers must buy expensive imported foodstuff. In this context, local and national decision-makers started thinking about the emergence of new local agricultural production in favor of food security by "the diversification of agricultural productions" towards local vegetables and fruits. However, achieving food self-sufficiency is highly complicated due to the multi-scale nature of this topic. Constraints for food crops cultivation can be found at each scale, the field with cropping systems not well adapted for the production of food crops, the farm with limited production resources, e. g. workforce, the region with a lack of water provision by specific water services. Agricultural policies can overcome these constraints by modifying {{the current state of the}} agricultural system at each spatial scale. In order to understand what would be the conditions for achieving food self-sufficiency, we built a static multi-scale bioeconomic model based on mathematical programming. This model simulates the decision process of 5336 farmers in Guadeloupe in terms of choice of cropping systems for their 25054 fields. A geographic database and activities compose the inputs of the model. The geographic database is built with a large range of geographical information encompassing the slope, the soil type, the altitude, the access to irrigation while the activities are a set of cropping systems determined by the expert knowledge of <b>local</b> farm <b>advisers.</b> that defined both allocation rules of the cropping systems at each spatial scale and mean outputs of cropping systems. A explorative scenario with new food crop systems at field scale, increased quantities of workforce at farm scale and extension of water provision areas at regional scale showed a large increase in food self-sufficiency. Such changes tested in our model appear as possible levers for actions that could be targeted by agricultural policies...|$|R
50|$|He was {{a popular}} youth activist {{in the ranks of}} Ilaje Patriotic Front (IPF), a {{frontline}} youth pressure group in the late 80's. The desire of the IPF was for Ilaje people to get to the promised land. They employed their intellectual prowess, provided leadership and ignited the thirst for development in the people. Through purposeful plans, commitment and loyalty to the course of the people, they made a mark and created legendary marks in our land. The group later metamorphosed into a political group. The group, in recognition of his stoic contributions insisted on him going into politics.In spite of the pressure of the group on him to join active politics, he stayed the course of his law practice until 1991 when he was made <b>Local</b> Government Legal <b>Adviser</b> of the Social Democratic Party, SDP. From 1991 to 1992, {{he was a member of}} Board of Internal Revenue in Ondo State. Since then, he has combined politics with his legal practice without necessarily leaving one for the other. He was elected a member, Federal House of Representatives representing Ilaje/Ese-odo federal constituency in 1992. By year 2000, he was appointed into the pioneer board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. At NDDC, his team executed and completed over two hundred and fifty projects. What he did on the board of NDDC and the experience garnered facilitated his appointment as the Executive Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC), another intervention agency, in 2004.|$|R
40|$|This study {{argues that}} the Transition Years science {{programs}} in Ontario, {{when compared with the}} National Curriculum science programs for Key Stage 3 in England and Wales, are being implemented in ways which: are less assessment driven, promote a wider variety of teaching methods, give teachers more ownership of the curriculum, and are less centralised. In investigating these hypotheses the researcher looked at the historical background to recent curriculum changes in Ontario, and in England and Wales, as well as interviewing teachers, principals and headteachers, and administering questionnaires, in both Ontario and England and Wales. The study showed that the education system in Ontario was more forward-looking and less centralised, with school boards playing an important role in curriculum development. The education system in England and Wales was more traditionalist and more centralised, with <b>Local</b> Education Authority <b>advisers</b> playing less of a role in curriculum development. The study also found that the education system was more assessment driven in England and Wales than in Ontario. The hypotheses that the science programs in Ontario were being implemented in ways which promote a wider variety of teaching methods, and which give teachers more ownership of the curriculum than in England and Wales, were found to be partially supported.

40|$|Throughout the English-speaking world, {{minority}} language children (LMC) or children who speak English {{as an additional}} language (EAL) are being educated in mainstream classrooms where they {{have little or no}} opportunity to use their mother tongue. This study investigates how educators at primary schools in Merseyside, where English is usually the only language in the classroom, respond to the educational and academic needs (linguistic, cognitive) of LMC/EAL children. It addresses socio-linguistic issues, teaching strategies and instructional approaches related to linguistic development and academic achievement of LMCIEAL pupils. It outlines the background to policy and practice in relation to LMCIEAL pupils in Britain. School districts across the United Kingdom are serving increasing number of children from varied cultural and social-linguistic backgrounds in mainstream classrooms. While the population of LMC/EAL will continue to increase, the majority of teachers and those in teacher programs are mainly from a white British background with limited awareness, knowledge and understanding of linguistic needs of LMC/EAL children in mainstream classrooms. Thus, a major challenge for educators is to develop and provide resources that enable teaching such diverse populations to become more effective. The research investigates in particular, how well local authorities and schools can raise standards for all learners in mainstream primary classrooms and examines the ways in which mainstream educational policy and practice has attempted to adapt in recognising that linguistic diversity is the norm rather than the exception in modem British society. The research focuses on what instructional strategies that schools employ in order to provide the best support for language minority children in the classroom in term of the individually focused approaches to learning, closer link between school and home and resources available for schools serving LMC/EAL pupils. The focus of this research is on the experience of staff from 20 primary schools within two local authorities in Merseyside. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with the primary schools staff and <b>local</b> authority <b>advisers</b> and government/school policy documents were used as data sources. The results of the study showed that the institution and community (use of first language) play a role in academic achievement of LMC/EAL pupils. The study revealed that teachers within mainstream classrooms recognise the importance of bilingualism, but {{due to the lack of}} resources and support, they found it hard to put it into practice. The results indicated that most participants were from a dominant language (English) background, which lack the awareness and experience needed to be effective in multi cultural classrooms. Suggestions are made for improved content delivery and further research including bilingualism as a teaching approach should become a legitimate topic for discussion and further research.
