25|$|As {{a result}} of the quota system for award, {{only a small number of}} medals could be awarded each time a ship was decommissioned. In general, about one in one hundred ratings of a ship's complement, upon {{recommendation}} by the Captain, was awarded the medal upon decommissioning. Many eligible men who had the time qualification did not receive the medal if the ship they had been serving on was too small to justify medals for all of its qualified ratings and many recipients were therefore considered <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> they managed to receive the medal. During the eighteen years it was in use, only approximately 740 of these medals were awarded.|$|E
25|$|The fourteenth 13-day {{period of}} the tonalpohualli ritual {{calendar}} started with the day ce itzcuintli (1-dog) and people, especially rulers, were fated to be especially <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> born on this day. The tenth day of the xiuhpohualli 20-day agricultural calendar, itzcuintli (dog), was governed by Mictlantecuhtli, the grim lord of the dead. In the Postclassic, when an Aztec commoner died he had to pass through each of the nine levels of Mictlan, the underworld. Mictlan was only reached {{after four years of}} wandering, accompanied by a dog that had been cremated with the deceased. The first level of Mictlan was called Apanoayan (where one crosses the river), this place was also known as Itzcuintlan (the Place of Dogs) because of the many dogs that roamed the near shore. A dog that recognised its former owner would carry him across the river on its back. In some accounts, the dogs on the shore act differently according to their colour, yellow dogs would carry the soul of the deceased across the river, while white dogs refuse because they have just washed themselves and black dogs refuse because either they have just swum the river or because they are dirty.|$|E
25|$|Karadžić was {{fortunate}} to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, and ask him to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E

[...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't in his right mind, to ask that question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads out of the parking lots.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I like what I see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E
500|$|By the 1957 season, Shirley Povich of The Washington Post {{expressed}} a clear preference for Pierce over Ford, writing that anyone doubting Pierce's {{place as the}} league's top left-hander was [...] "risking committal as an incurable psycho who can neither read the figures nor respond to reason." [...] Pierce's 4–3 win over the Yankees on July 28, 1959 put the White Sox in first place, where they stayed {{for the remainder of}} the season to take their first pennant in 40 years; it was his 160th victory with Chicago, breaking Doc White's team record for wins by a left-hander (he broke White's club records for career games and innings by a left-hander the same year). In late 1958, sportswriter Edgar Munzel wrote, [...] "The primary difference between Pierce and Ford, in their long-standing duel for southpaw supremacy in the American League, is that Pierce is pitching for a woefully weak hitting team, while Ford is backed by the league's most powerful offensive machine... An even greater boon to Whitey is the fact that he doesn't have to face the Yankees." [...] Of Pierce, who he described as the top White Sox pitcher for the past decade, he added, [...] "Normally, he's <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> he's supported with as many as two runs when he faces the Yankees." ...|$|E

500|$|By mid-1858 the {{problems}} with the Thames had been building for several years. In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself <b>lucky</b> <b>if</b> he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream".

If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included, if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.|$|E
