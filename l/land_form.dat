500|$|Glaciers {{from the}} most recent ice ages did not reach south far enough to flatten the land in Brown County, though glacier meltwater helped deepen gullies in the region, and made hills steeper. [...] Brown County State Park's Weed Patch Hill is the highest point in the area, at [...] above sea level. [...] The region {{is part of the}} Knobstone Escarpment <b>land</b> <b>form,</b> which {{consists}} of steep hills and valleys located between northern Brown County and the Ohio River. [...] The rocks in this area contain significant amounts of silica, and were part of a large delta system over 330 million years ago. [...] Brown County's minerals are part of the Borden Group, and are mostly siltstone. [...] Limestone, dolostone, and chert are the Borden Group's secondary minerals.|$|E
500|$|The park's {{land was}} {{gradually}} {{acquired by the}} Government of South Australia beginning in 1966, based on recommendations in a 1962 report. From 1981 onwards, plans were published that aimed to develop the area for commercial purposes, but public pressure led to its declaration as a public reserve in 1989. The last land added was a small area in 2003. Anstey Hill is a [...] peak in the park's south. Both hill and park are named after a road built by agricultural pioneer George Alexander Anstey. Fire authorities regard the park as an [...] "arson hotspot", and it is frequently burned by bushfiresmostly deliberately lit. There is no permanent water except for springs in Water Gully, adjacent to ruins of a nursery, {{although there are many}} seasonal creeks. Much of the land is steep, rising [...] across the park's breadth, with gradients often steeper than one in three. Erosion and land movements due to a significant geologic fault zone created this <b>land</b> <b>form.</b> The Gun Emplacement, a listed Geologic Monument and remnant of an ancient land surface, lies in the southwestern corner.|$|E
40|$|The whole farm {{financial}} {{effects of}} laser <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> were analysed using a two stage modelling procedure. In the first stage, linear programming models of representative Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) rice farms {{were used to}} predict the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without successive increments of <b>land</b> <b>forming.</b> In the second stage, the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without an increment became inputs into a spreadsheet model designed to undertake discounted cash flow analysis of investment in the increment. The transition over time of yields to the achievable levels for <b>land</b> <b>formed</b> layouts was accounted for in the spreadsheet model, as were the effects of taxation (including taxation concessions for <b>land</b> <b>forming)</b> and access to concessional credit from the Special Conservation Scheme of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority. The analysis suggests that <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> the full area of a typical MIA rice farm is warranted, but that priority in allocating a limited capital budget {{should be given to}} areas requiring relatively low volumes of earth to be moved. A financial analysis of 'topsoiling' (replacing topsoil on areas from which it has been 'heavy cut' during <b>land</b> <b>forming)</b> showed it to generate considerably lower rates of return than <b>land</b> <b>forming.</b> Thus it appears <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> should be given priority overtopsoiling in allocating a limited capital budget.

60|$|We {{learn from}} the journal of Columbus that, on the 11th of October, 1492, he {{continued}} steering W. S. W. until sunset, {{when he returned to}} his old course of west, the vessels running at the rate of three leagues an hour. At ten o'clock he and several of his crew saw a light, which seemed like a torch carried about on land. He continued running on four hours longer, and had made a distance of twelve leagues farther west, when {{at two in the morning}} land was discovered ahead, distant two leagues. The twelve leagues which, they ran since ten o'clock, with the two leagues distance from the <b>land,</b> <b>form</b> a total corresponding essentially with the distance and situation of Waiting's Island from San Salvador; and it is thence presumed, that the light seen at that hour was on Watling's Island, which they were then passing. Had the light been seen on land ahead, and they had kept running on four hours, at the rate of three leagues an hour, they must have run high and dry on shore. As the admiral himself received the royal reward for having seen this light, as the first discovery of land, Watling's Island is believed to be the point for which this premium was granted.|$|E
