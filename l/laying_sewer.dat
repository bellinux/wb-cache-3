50|$|With so many bodies still {{lying in}} the earth at Volta Park, it is not {{uncommon}} for additional remains or for funerary monuments to be uncovered. About 1920, the Eden family living at 3311 Q Street NW uncovered nine bodies buried in the dirt floor of their basement. The family reburied them in the local street (at the time, a dirt road). Workmen digging a ditch for new fresh water lines uncovered human remains at the playground in September 1942. The bones were placed into boxes and interred at Blue Plains, a pauper's burial ground maintained by the city. About 1944, workmen digging a trench to <b>lay</b> <b>sewer</b> pipes across the southern part of the park exposed a brick burial vault. A large number of bones were removed from the vault, and taken away. Local residents often found tombstones or pieces of funerary monuments in the park. Carl Ernst, whose home was located at 1522 33rd Street NW, found numerous headstones in the 1930s and 1940s, some dating as far back as 1790. The Washington Post reported in 1949 that he embedded them in a cement wall on his property. In the early 1950s, workmen at the park unearthed the skeleton of a girl with long red hair and still wearing her funeral dress.|$|R

They may also collect commercial waste if requested to do so, but are not obliged to provide this service. Industrial waste can only be collected with the consent of the waste disposal authority (s.45(2)).

50|$|The council met {{fortnightly}} until 1897, {{and until}} its demise generally met once a month. In 1886 {{there were seven}} committees, for the town hall, commons, cemetery, highways, hospital, finance, and drainage. The provision of a sewerage system {{was the first major}} task confronting the local board, and was finally accomplished in 1896, <b>laying</b> main <b>sewers</b> through four parishes beyond to reach the major works at Twickenham which avoided acquiring costly riverside land at Staines: its importance in the council's affairs is reflected in the fact that 'general purposes' became associated in the title of the drainage committee in 1897 and the two were not divided until 1930. The hospital committee was dissolved soon after it was formed, without having provided a hospital. In 1957 the council had ten committees, and two standing sub-committees. By 1939 the urban district contained 500 council houses, of which 94 were in Staines itself. Between 1947 and 1957 a further 1,369 were built almost all in the former Rural District - two, were in Staines parish and these are described as 'sold'.|$|R
5000|$|Originally a [...] "quiet, prosperous area" [...] with a {{population}} of a few thousand people, Crawley was selected as the site of a New Town under the provisions of the New Towns Act 1946. Crawley Development Corporation was formed in 1947 to establish, administer and control the town's development, including the provision of services. Sewerage, drainage, and the supply of water, gas and electricity were all planned and laid out for the town as a whole, rather than for the 13 residential neighbourhoods individually. Services were prioritised early in the development process: the New Town was designated in January 1947, and by 1949 the Development Corporation had surveyed the designated area, planned and designed the required infrastructure and negotiated some contracts for their construction. Because work focused on the provision of services at first, housebuilding in the new town was slow in the first few years. [...] An important feature of the master plan was the <b>laying</b> of <b>sewer</b> and utility pipes under grass verges rather than beneath roads, as was conventional in Britain; this made them more accessible and reduced disruption during improvement works.|$|R
50|$|Briggs was {{a modern}} {{practitioner}} with {{a flair for}} modern methods and modern ideas. He understood the correlation between life expectancy, {{public health and the}} living conditions of the people; he understood the relationship between dirt and infection. In his endeavour {{to improve the quality of}} life of the people he championed many social reforms. He was largely responsible for the introduction of the Overwater Gravitational Water Scheme, from which Aspatria and Silloth draw their drinking water. He also proposed the <b>laying</b> of <b>sewers</b> within Aspatria; thus eliminating a major source of the prevailing insanitary conditions that directly led to the epidemic killer diseases, Cholera and Typhoid. He also challenged the evils of acute household overcrowding. When the opportunity arose, he encouraged the Urban District Council to build two successful housing schemes in the district. On one occasion he had the satisfaction of reporting the lowest death rate of any other urban district in England and Wales, upon which he received many congratulations from the medical fraternity. Briggs practiced medicine at a time when the country doctor was expected to be a ‘master of all trades’; he was not a GP in the modern sense, hospitalisation in rural communities was rare, if not unheard of. He had to contend with a variety of epidemics in addition to the Coal mining and agricultural accidents, many of which required major surgery and amputations.|$|R

30|$|Most of {{methanogen}} {{was strictly}} anaerobic {{and a small}} amount of methanogen was anoxic and aerobic. According to the <b>laying</b> of gravity <b>sewer,</b> there are manholes among the sewers. Usually, there is oxygen in gravity sewers. In this study, the methane production was less than which obtained in rising main sewers in previous research (Guisasola et al. 2008, 2009). An important reason may be that anaerobic environment in rising main sewers is more beneficial to methane production. In addition, rising main sewers were full of sewage so that biofilm could develop on the entire surface of sewers. There is an obvious difference between gravity sewer and rising main sewer. Gravity sewers are not full of sewage. The biofilm could not grow on the places which are not covered with sewage. This would lead to difference in microorganism amount and that affects the methane production.|$|R

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the redevelopment plan, Marshall Heights residents began to demand in August 1949 that the freeze on improvements be lifted. City officials refused, arguing that with half of all homes in the neighborhood facing condemnation for safety reasons, redevelopment was the only option. The city also argued that it would be too expensive to build water and sewer lines along the existing street plan, and that residents would be unable to afford the hookup and frontage fees. In September 1949, District engineers staked out sewer, water, and natural gas lines along two streets in Marshall Heights to demonstrate the difficulties in construction and prove how costly the effect would be to residents. From this example, the city claimed that <b>laying</b> water and <b>sewer</b> lines in Marshall Heights would cost $1.2 million more than in any other neighborhood, and said that razing all the homes in the area, realigning streets around hills, regrading streets, and filling in valleys was the only feasible and cost-effective option.|$|R
5000|$|Gaylord Logan and Lewis Pratt, two Albany lawyers, using a $100,000 {{bank loan}} in 1869 {{to buy the}} area which later {{gave birth to the}} name of Pine Hills.

The hills were {{sculptured}} into terraced lawns, which can still be seen on South Allen Street, where in 1889 tax records describe a [...] "Pine Grove" [...] between 88 and 112 South Allen. The area they had purchased was from Allen Street west to Manning Boulevard and from Cortland Street north to Washington Avenue. Logan and Pratt formed the Albany Land Improvement Company and began selling 50 ft by 200 ft lots in 1881 after having laid out and paved tree-lined streets along with flagstone sidewalks, and <b>laying</b> water, <b>sewer,</b> and gas mains as well. Homes in the area were constructed by the Sano-Rubin Construction Company and the West End Building Company. These two companies also constructed many other homes throughout the city. Covenants in the deeds [...] "forever prevent the use of the property for businesspurposes or the sale of intoxicating liquors" [...] which predate the use of zoning in the city of Albany. Originally the lots sold for $1,200, but by 1891 reduced to $840, after the Depression of 1893 the bank foreclosed on the land and sold the lots even cheaper. Beginning in 1886, the West End Building Company constructed 200 homes, and in the early 20th century, the Sano-Rubin Construction Company constructed another 400.|$|R
5000|$|Handsworth Victoria Park {{was founded}} in the 1880s by the Handsworth Local Sanitary Board - a body instituted by the government, and led by locally elected citizens, to oversee the supply of clean water and the <b>laying</b> down of <b>sewers</b> for the growing {{population}} of the area. As the Civic Gospel of municipal improvement spread from centre of Birmingham into the growing suburban estates of Handsworth, its local government leaders saw a public park as {{a benefit for the}} district. Following the setting up of an education board and a free library, the adoption and proper kerbing of roads, street lighting, tramways and the construction of sewers, influential voices in the district began to speak of the need for a 'lung' in the city. They did not pursue this idea simply out of expediency or to raise the value of their properties. Such self-interest was present - used unashamedly to strengthen their case among the practically minded citizens of Handsworth - but opposition to the Park from that quarter was at times so intense that calculative motives alone would not have carried the project through.|$|R
50|$|In 1899 Union College {{announced}} that, {{in order}} to pay off a $30,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) debt, it would sell two adjacent tracts of land. One, the College Meadow, was a 30 acre parcel to the west; the other, the College Woods, was 75 acre in size and located immediately to the east of the college. Prominent citizens of the city called for the land to be developed into a park, and a petition to that effect gained 2,200 signatures. The college proposed to lease the land to the city for that purpose, but at a very high annual rate. Shortly afterward, several members of the board of General Electric, which had grown rapidly since Thomas Edison had moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady in 1886, announced that the company would buy the land from the college for $57,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), retiring the college's debt.They formed a subsidiary, Schenectady Realty Company, to purchase and develop the land.

More than 500 men worked on erecting the frame, while 2,000 men erected the facade and interior walls, and worked <b>laying</b> electrical, water, <b>sewer,</b> and gas lines. Longacre Engineering Company of New York was the general contractor. Construction costs continued to rise, however. Although scheduled to open January 1, 1924, the hotel remained unfinished. The Allen E. Walker Investment Company, the largest shareholder in the Hotel Walker Company began running short of funds, slowing construction. Nearing bankruptcy, the Walker Investment sold its interest in the Hotel Walker to C.C. Mitchell & Company, builder of large apartment complexes and hotels in Boston and Detroit. The reported price of the sale was $5.7 million for the $8.5 million hotel. But in fact, costs had risen much higher, and the hotel's final cost was closer to $11 million ($ in [...] dollars).
