2500|$|Whitefish Point Unit of Seney National Wildlife Refuge: The USFWS {{manages the}} [...] {{transferred}} {{to them from}} the former Whitefish Point Light Station {{as part of the}} Seney National Wildlife Refuge. [...] In conjunction with the WPBO and other conservation groups, the USFWS added [...] acres and more than [...] of Lake Superior shoreline as critical piping plover habitat to Whitefish Point unit on August 30, 2012. The land of the Whitefish Point Unit is [...] "Wooded Dune and Swell Complex" [...] that is distinctive to the Great Lakes region. It supports a diversity of species, including lady slippers, starflower, bunchberry, <b>Labrador-tea,</b> and a variety of trees. [...] Whitefish Point is on a world migratory flyway. [...] The data collected by the WPBO led to establishing Whitefish Point as a Globally Important Bird Area. [...] In 2001, USFWS designated all of its Whitefish Point property as critical habitat for the piping plover. [...] In 2009, the piping plover began nesting at Whitefish Point again {{for the first time in}} at least two decades.|$|E
5000|$|Chrysomyxa ledicola is a plant {{pathogen}} {{responsible for the}} disease Large-Spored Spruce-Labrador Tea Rust. It affects white spruce, black spruce, Sitka spruce, Englemann spruce, and <b>Labrador-tea.</b> [...] It is also {{the cause of the}} orange goo that covered the Inupiat village of Kivalina, Alaska in the summer of 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Danes Moss is a lowland raised bog, a {{rare and}} {{threatened}} habitat in the United Kingdom. The SSSI citation describes it as [...] "the largest example in Cheshire of a cut-over raised mire...a valuable example of a habitat now rare in lowland England", noting that the peat is up to 5 m deep, a substantial thickness. Seven species of Sphagnum moss are found here. Locally uncommon plants include round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), bottle sedge (Carex rostrata), common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica) and fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum) and the nationally rare <b>Labrador-tea</b> (Rhododendron tomentosum).|$|E

In conjunction with the WPBO and other conservation groups, the USFWS added 19.85 acres acres and more than 1000 ft of Lake Superior shoreline as critical piping plover habitat to Whitefish Point unit on August 30, 2012.

5000|$|The Ozette Lake {{area of the}} Olympic Peninsula, Washington (state), is an area {{of dense}} {{temperate}} rainforest dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and was the home of the Makah Indians. [...] Ozette Village, one of five Makah villages, sat on a bench above the beach at Cape Alava, about 3 miles west of the lake. This village was first occupied in approximately the year 0 C.E., and was still occupied into the 1930s. A foot trail ran from the village to the northwestern end of Ozette Lake. In the past this trail was called Indian Village Trail. Currently it is called the Cape Alava Trail. The Ozette Village residents used the trail to access both the lake and two open bog wetlands, now called Ahlstrom's Prairie and Roose's Prairie. These open areas, locally called prairies, are about 1.5 miles from the beach to the west and the lake to the east. They are not prairie in the usual sense, but are herbaceous bogs with peaty soil that is saturated for most of the growing season, and are dominated by mosses, sedges and low growing ericaceous subshrubs; rather than having well-drained soil dominated by grasses. Both Ahlstrom's and Roose's prairies were used to gather berries, <b>Labrador-tea,</b> and basketry materials, and as hunting areas for elk, deer, and black bear. Oral histories from both Makah tribal members and descendants of early settlers indicate that the Makah people regularly burned these prairies to keep the herbaceous bogs from succeeding to trees and dense brush. Bog cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), in particular, grew only in the prairies, and was both a dietary staple and a valuable trade item.|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of the ethereal oils of the Labrador-teas from Siberia and Far-Eart flora in which 103 substances have been identified has been studied in details; four of them are the new natural compounds (the structures have been determined by the special methods), seven substances have been extracted firstly from natural objects, and 11 substances did't discover earlier in the ethereal oils of the Labrador-teas. The intraspecific chemical changeability of the ethereal oils of the marsh and large-leaf Labrador-teas has been studied. Four basic <b>Labrador-tea</b> chemotypes with strong-expressed biogenetic directions in the synthesis of the mono- and sesquiterpenoids have been revealed. The {{composition of}} the acids and phenol in the Labrador-teas can serve the chemotaxonomic sign. The antimycotic activity of the ethereal oils of the Labrador-teas and their separate components has been studied. Usage field: bio-organic chemistry, chemistry of natural and physiological active substances.
