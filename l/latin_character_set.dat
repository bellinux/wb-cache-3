5000|$|Many {{compatibility}} {{characters are}} semantically distinct characters, {{though they may}} share representational glyphs with other characters. Some of these characters may have been included because most other <b>characters</b> <b>sets</b> that focused on one script or writing system. So for example, the ISO and other <b>Latin</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> likely included a character for π (pi) since, when focusing on primarily one writing system or script, those <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> would not have otherwise had characters for the common mathematical symbol π;. However, with Unicode, mathematicians are free to use characters from any known script in the World to stand in for a mathematical set or mathematical constant. To date, Unicode has only added specific semantic support for a few such mathematical constants (for example the Planck constant, U+210E, and Euler constant, U+2107, both of which Unicode considers to be compatibility characters). Therefore, Unicode designates several mathematical symbols based on letters from Greek and Hebrew as compatibility characters. These include: ...|$|R

A complete support for the Greek alphabet (including small letters) requires a national version of the shifted 7-bit table (using the ESC code for each national character encoded in this shifted table), or an unspecified proprietary 8-bit encoding, or the use of the UCS-2 encoding (see below).|$|R
