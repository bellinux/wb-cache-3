5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, <b>lacerations</b> of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{analyze the}} reason of canalicular <b>laceration,</b> {{and to explore}} the methods and {{techniques}} to raise the success rate of lacrimal canaliculi <b>laceration</b> anastomosis. METHODS: Seventy-eight cases(78 eyes) with canalicular underwent lacrimal canaliculi <b>laceration</b> anastomosis through catheter support under microscope at I stage. RESULTS: The operation was successful in all cases. The extubation time was at 3 months after operation. After one-year follow-up, lower lacrimal canaliculi were all unobstructed. CONCLUSION: The causes of canalicular <b>laceration</b> <b>laceration</b> mostly were frustrated <b>laceration.</b> Receiving anastomosis under microscope at I stage was preferred and necessary.

40|$|AbstractLaceration {{injuries}} in rugby union account for approximately 6 % of all injuries sustained during match play. Commentators often cite {{the design of}} studded footwear as a causal factor in <b>laceration</b> injuries. In order to assess the <b>laceration</b> injury risk of different stud designs, {{there is a need}} to develop a testing protocol that is able to replicate the <b>laceration</b> injury event. This study used a questionnaire to identify the play scenarios that result in <b>laceration</b> injuries. The questionnaire was answered by 191 rugby players, of which 72 % had experienced one or more stud injuries during their career which hindered them playing rugby. Half of the <b>laceration</b> injuries described by the respondents came from the ruck, and 27 % from a tackle. When analysing free-text responses, a deliberate stamp was described in 35 % of the responses and a tackle from behind was described in 14 % of responses. These injury scenarios are considered to be the dominant cause of <b>laceration</b> injuries. In future work the identified injury scenarios will be replicated in simulated play and kinetic and kinematic measurements will be recorded. This will inform test parameters for future assessment of <b>laceration</b> injury risk of stud designs...|$|R
5|$|An early {{estimate}} by the Small Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of <b>lacerations,</b> a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, but six were admitted.|$|E
5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their <b>lacerations</b> been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. <b>Lacerations</b> may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete <b>lacerations</b> may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe <b>lacerations.</b> Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E

5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and <b>lacerations.</b> Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused <b>lacerations.</b> Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple <b>lacerations</b> and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and <b>lacerations.</b> Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E

2500|$|A {{pulmonary}} <b>laceration</b> {{can cause}} air to leak {{out of the}} lacerated lung [...] and into the pleural space, if the <b>laceration</b> goes through to it. Pulmonary <b>laceration</b> invariably results in pneumothorax (due to torn airways), hemothorax (due to torn blood vessels), or a hemopneumothorax (with both blood and air in the chest cavity). Unlike hemothoraces that occur due to pulmonary contusion, those due to lung <b>laceration</b> may be large and long lasting. However, the lungs do not usually bleed very much because the blood vessels involved are small and the pressure within them is low.

Most of massive subdural hematomas due to falx <b>laceration,</b> tentorial <b>laceration</b> or occipital diastasis have a rapid lethal course or patients may have permanent neurological disability.

Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E

Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison.

Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal <b>lacerations,</b> there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
