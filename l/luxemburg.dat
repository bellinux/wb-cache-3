5|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{financial}} burdens {{resulting from the}} Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg</b> put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained {{only a quarter of}} the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, who knew that pennies of higher value would again be minted in a few years, suspended the collection of the tithe in 1434.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{converted}} into a Gothic anti-Hussite fortress under Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg</b> in 1430, became a Renaissance castle in 1562, and was rebuilt in 1649 in the baroque style. Under Queen Maria Theresa, the castle became a prestigious royal seat. In 1811, the castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire and lay in ruins until the 1950s, when it was rebuilt mostly in its former Theresian style.|$|E

5|$|During {{the revolt}} many {{attempts}} were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist the revolt and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg</b> sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a coalition with the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued the revolt and marched through Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians.|$|E

Louis, whose health was quickly deteriorating, invited the representatives of the Polish prelates and lord for a meeting in Zólyom. Upon his demand, the Poles swore loyalty to his daughter, Mary, and her bride, Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg,</b> on 25 July 1382. Louis died in Nagyszombat in the night on 10 or 11 September 1382. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Cathedral in a chapel that had been built upon his orders.|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to present some reflections about Rosa <b>Luxemburg’s</b> {{works from the}} first Russian revolution (1905 - 1906). I consider <b>Luxemburg’s</b> view on the historical meaning of this revolution and discuss her analyses of class struggle in 1905 - 1906. The description of class struggle’s forms and its dynamics {{is the most important}} and interesting excerpt of <b>Luxemburg’s</b> works from this time. She emphasized the meaning of a revolutionary sense of freedom and the changing workers consciousness that happens during the revolution. She presents an inspiring dialectic relation between defeated rebellion or revolution and the final victory of socialist movement. I think that <b>Luxemburg’s</b> perspective may be useful for research on contemporary social struggles (e. g. “Arab Spring”, “Occupy!”) and helpful in searching for new forms of organization for radical liberation movements. </p...|$|R

5|$|Charles III of Naples {{landed in}} Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg</b> invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing {{the queen mother}} to give Mary in {{marriage}} to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda. After Mary renounced the throne, Charles was crowned king on 31December 1385, but he was murdered at the instigation of Mary's mother in February 1386. Mary was restored, but the murdered king's supporters captured her and her mother on 25July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, but Mary was released on 4June 1387. Mary officially remained the co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence on the government was minimal. She and her premature son died after her horse threw her during a hunting trip.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys {{adhered to}} Roman Catholicism. The Diocese of Transylvania {{included}} {{most of the}} province, but the Saxons of Southern Transylvania were subjected to the archbishops of Esztergom. Catholic commoners were to pay an ecclesiastic tax, the tithe, but John XXIII exempted the lesser noblemen from paying it in 1415. However, George Lépes, the bishop of Transylvania, ignored this decision, especially after John had been declared an antipope. They were originally exempt from the ecclesiastic tax, but Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg,</b> king of Hungary, decreed that the Vlachs who settled on lands abandoned by Catholic peasants were to also pay the tithe. Sigismund was an absent monarch, deeply involved in European politics; he spent much time outside Hungary, especially in his other realms, such as Germany and Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans had conquered {{most of the}} Balkans {{and reduced}} Byzantine {{influence}} to the area immediately surrounding Constantinople after victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Nicopolis was seized from the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Shishman in 1393 {{and a year later}} Pope Boniface IX proclaimed a new Crusade against the Turks, although the Western Schism had split the papacy. This Crusade was led by Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg,</b> King of Hungary; many French nobles joined Sigismund's forces, including the Crusade's military leader, John the Fearless (son of the Duke of Burgundy). Sigismund advised the Crusaders to adopt a cautious, more defensive strategy, when they reached the Danube, instead they besieged the city of Nicopolis. The Ottomans defeated them in the Battle of Nicopolis on 25September, capturing 3,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg</b> the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E

5|$|According to Matteo Villani, Louis {{launched}} an expedition against the Golden Horde {{at the head}} of an army of 200,000 horsemen in April 1354. The young Tatar ruler, whom historian Iván Bertényi identified as Jani Beg, did not want to wage war against Hungary and agreed to sign a peace treaty. Although no other primary source mentioned that campaign and treaty, the Tatars made no plundering raids in Transylvania after 1354, which suggests that Villani's report is reliable. In the same year, Louis invaded Serbia, forcing Stefan Dušan to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. Under duress, Dušan initiated negotiations with the Holy See for acknowledgement of the popes' primacy. The following year, Louis sent reinforcements to Casimir III to fight against the Lithuanians, and Hungarian troops supported Albert II, Duke of Austria, against Zürich. The Venetian delegates offered Louis 6–7,000 golden ducats as a compensation for Dalmatia, but Louis refused to give up his plan to reconquer the province. He signed an alliance with Albert II of Austria and Nicolaus of <b>Luxemburg,</b> Patriarch of Aquileia, against Venice. Upon his order, Croatian lords besieged and captured Klis, a Dalmatian fortress that Stefan Dušan's sister, Jelena, had inherited from her husband, Mladen Šubić.|$|E
5|$|In 1385 Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania {{agreed to}} marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland in the Union of Kreva.

The official Lithuanian conversion to Christianity removed the religious {{rationale for the}} order's activities in the area. Its grand master, Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein, supported by the Hungarian king, Sigismund of <b>Luxemburg,</b> responded by publicly contesting the sincerity of Jogaila's conversion, bringing the charge to a papal court. The territorial disputes continued over Samogitia, which had been in Teutonic hands since the Peace of Raciąż in 1404. Poland also had territorial claims against the Knights in Dobrzyń Land and Gdańsk (Danzig), but the two states had been largely at peace since the Treaty of Kalisz (1343). The conflict was also motivated by trade considerations: The knights controlled the lower reaches of the three largest rivers (the Neman, Vistula and Daugava) in Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{received}} the order for Fall Gelb at 13:15, during lunch, on 9 May 1940. The German attack began at 5:35 {{on the morning}} of 10 May 1940. The XIX Armeekorps advanced without resistance through <b>Luxemburg</b> and reached the Belgian border at 10:00. The 1st and 2nd Panzer Division reached the line Menufontaine (south of Bastogne) – Fauvillers, the 10th Panzer Division the line Rulles (west of Habay) – St. Marie (west of Étalle), that evening. The advance breached the second Belgian line of defence at Bouillon and Neufchâteau on 11 May. The German forces, consisting of the 1st and 10th Panzer Division reached the area north of Sedan on the night of 12/13 May. The following day at 8:00 German Ju 87 Stukas and bombers from Luftflotte 3 (3rd Air Fleet) targeted the French and Belgian forces in what would become the Battle of Sedan. At 15:30 the German artillery began a 30-minute bombardment followed by an aerial attack. German troops began crossing the Meuse at 16:00 in rubber assault boats.

5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa <b>Luxemburg,</b> the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{some issues}} raised by Rosa <b>Luxemburg's</b> theory of imperialism that are central to current debates on globalisation. Methodologically, despite widespread scepticism {{on the use of}} mathematics in Marxist social science, <b>Luxemburg's</b> rigorous analysis of Marx's schemes of reproduction forcefully shows the importance of theoretical abstraction and formal modelling. Indeed, this paper analyses <b>Luxemburg's</b> theory by means of an intertemporal generalisation of Roemer's (1983) economy with a global capital market. It focuses in particular on two substantive issues: the relation between capital accumulation and imperialism, and the role of force and non-competitive distortions in imperialistic international relations. It argues that differences in development and competitive credit markets, rather than realisation problems, are important to understand the emergence of international exploitation, whereas extra-economic coercion may be important to understand its persistence. ...|$|R
