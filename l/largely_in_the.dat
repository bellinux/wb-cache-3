5|$|The town of Manchester {{was granted}} a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local {{government}} was <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of manorial courts, the last of which was dissolved in 1846.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, {{and continued to}} deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian Armistice in September 1943, two boats were scuttled by their crews. The four {{surviving}} Italian boats were taken over by German forces and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy), serving <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aegean Sea until they were finally scuttled in October 1944 as the Germans withdrew from Greece. The two boats that had escaped to the Allies in 1941 returned to Yugoslavia after the war. They were commissioned in the new Yugoslav Navy and remained in service until the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Concert {{promoter}} AEG Live {{has faced}} criticism since the film's confirmation, <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of accusations {{that the film}} was made simply for profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family refused to support the film, and some family members even attempted to stop the film agreement in August 2009. In the same month, however, a judge approved a deal between Jackson's estate, AEG Live, and Columbia Pictures. The agreement allowed Columbia to edit the {{hundreds of hours of}} rehearsal footage needed to create the film. Columbia subsequently paid $60 million for the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} bioaccumulate arsenic, <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of arsenobetaine.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad from Los Angeles reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877, Tucson in March 1880, El Paso in May 1881, {{and thus}} {{completed}} the second transcontinental railroad in December 1881. The portion in Arizona was originally <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gadsden Purchase but {{the western part}} was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix. The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between Mexico and the United States after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had gone into effect, and before {{the time of the}} Gadsden Purchase. The Santa Fe Railroad Company also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via Prescott, Winslow, Flagstaff and Kingman in August 1883.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, {{a direct result}} of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.|$|E
5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) air {{campaign against the}} VRS codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, targeting VRS air defences, artillery positions and storage facilities <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Days after commencement of the offensive, the VRS positions {{to the right and}} {{to the left of the}} HV and the HVO advance were also attacked by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in Operation Sana. The offensive achieved its objectives and set the stage for further advances of the HV, HVO and ARBiH towards Banja Luka, contributing to the resolution of the war.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen {{subspecies}} {{have been}} described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colour of their underparts. The nominate subspecies Passer rutilans rutilans breeds in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and southeastern and central China. The subspecies intensior, described in 1922 by Walter Rothschild from Yunnan, breeds in southwest China {{and parts of}} India, Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. In {{a large part of}} Sichuan intensior intergrades with the nominate subspecies, and a number of subspecies names have been proposed for the intergrades. The subspecies cinnamomeus, described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern Arunachal Pradesh to Nuristan in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl was {{appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, {{the first of}} which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been <b>largely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.|$|E
