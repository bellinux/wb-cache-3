40|$|A {{device for}} {{measuring}} RMS granularity of uniformly exposed and uniformly processed photographic material was built. This paper {{deals with the}} construction of the major components of the system. The components constructed were the <b>lamp</b> <b>mount,</b> lamp housing, current regulated ripple free power supply for the lamp, the replacement of the motor drive system for the sample stage with a synchronous motor, and the construction of the photo detection system. All these components were mounted on a triangular optical bench around an existing symetrical design microdensitometer with rotating sample stage...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese Garden of the Fábio Barreto Municipal Forest/Zoo in Ribeirão Preto, {{state of}} São Paulo, Brazil, was analyzed. Among the {{vegetation}} elements, 362 individuals (trees and shrubs) were identified, covering 80 species, 69 genera and 41 families. The Shannon-Weaver biodiversity {{index of the}} area was 3. 48. Many plants (50 %) are not of Asian origin, mischaracterizing the garden. Some elements such as the pagoda, a stone <b>lamp,</b> <b>Mount</b> Fuji and the bridges to the island {{in the center of}} one of the lakes were according with the philosophy of a Japanese garden; however, other aspects like commemorative plates, trash containers and concrete benches were uncharacteristic. The survey conducted to know the visitor profile and value for local respondents concluded that most visitors have high school education (42 %), are women (52 %) or are between 41 and 60 years old (44 %). Most (88 %) are unaware of the principles that guide the Japanese garden style. The style of the garden is not fully characteristic and showed maintenance problems...|$|E
50|$|The 12 m high {{light has}} two double banked units of twelve <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> facing in {{opposite}} directions, rotated by an AGA PRB21 Gearless Drive Unit operating at three revolutions-per-minute, thus giving a flash {{in any given}} direction every ten seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Wabash Indiana was {{the first}} city to use arc lamps. On March 31, 1880, they turned on four arc <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> on the towering dome of city hall. [...] Wabash used a {{self-regulating}} lamp invented by Charles Brush in 1870.|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} area {{there is a}} wood stove placed on a stone hearth and an oil <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> on a post. Interior walls are {{original}} horsehair plaster and unpainted paneling. Wooden interior columns are rounded rather than chamfered as in other meetinghouses in Dutchess County.|$|R

Supplied as an {{optional}} extra for any 700-type instrument, this handset was also available with 'Lamp Signalling': a neon <b>lamp,</b> <b>mounted</b> in the top centre of the handle, flashed whenever the bell rang.|$|R
50|$|At Sundsvall-Härnösand Airport near Sundsvall, Sweden, {{airfield}} {{lighting is}} provided by sulfur <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> on towers 30 metres tall. The lamps are directed upward and shine their light onto wing-shaped secondary reflectors that spread the light out and direct it downward. In this way, one lamp can illuminate an area 30 by 80 m.|$|R
50|$|In May 1929 {{two large}} <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on a tripod}} toppled over on a sound stage where Burgess {{was working at the}} Fox Movietone Studio. She was cut {{severely}} over her left eye by one of the incandescent lamps. Burgess was rushed to a studio hospital where several stitches were taken in her wound.|$|R
50|$|More complex {{forms of}} {{photometric}} measurement are used frequently within the lighting industry. Spherical photometers {{can be used}} to measure the directional luminous flux produced by lamps, and consist of a large-diameter globe with a <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> at its center. A photocell rotates about the lamp in three axes, measuring the output of the lamp from all sides.|$|R

50|$|In photography, a {{copy stand}} is a device used to copy images and/or text with a camera. The stand {{consists}} of a board onto which the media is placed and a tripod-mount parallel to it, usually with an adjustable height. Light is provided by bright <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on either side of}} the media at 45° angles. This provides uniform lighting and reduces specular reflection, keeping glare low.|$|R
40|$|Electric heat lamps {{provide a}} versatile, {{inexpensive}} heat source for today's livestock production farming practices. Heat rays from infrared lamps {{pass through the}} air without heating it, as does energy from the sun. When these rays strike an animal, heat energy is absorbed. Using this radiant heat principle, <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> at the proper height establish "comfort" zones where young animals can move about and seek the degree of warmth desired...|$|R
50|$|Staging {{the play}} was a low-key and low-budget affair. Lighting {{consisted}} of two scoop <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> on wooden poles. As with all of Lee's Ecotheater productions, a backdrop for the playing area (no stage) is typically made with 2x4 lumber and brackets, and {{can be set up}} just about anywhere in a very short period or time—in a parking lot, a field, yards, a room in a prison.|$|R

50|$|Inspection {{flashlights}} have permanently mounted light guides containing {{optical fibers}} or plastic rods. Another style has a <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the end}} of a flexible cable, or a semi-rigid or articulated probe. Such lamps are used for inspection inside tanks, or inside structures such as aircraft. Where used for inspecting the interior of tanks containing flammable liquids, the inspection lights may also be rated as flame-proof (explosion-proof) so that they cannot ignite liquids or vapors.|$|R
50|$|The R8 also {{features}} a distinctive curved bar of LED daytime running <b>lamps</b> (DRLs) <b>mounted</b> inside the xenon HID headlamp casings.|$|R

2500|$|Turn signals—formally called [...] "direction indicators" [...] or [...] "directional signals", and informally {{known as}} [...] "directionals", [...] "blinkers", [...] "indicators" [...] or [...] "flashers"—are {{blinking}} <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> near {{the left and}} right front and rear corners of a vehicle, and sometimes on the sides or on the side mirrors of a vehicle, activated by the driver {{on one side of the}} vehicle at a time to advertise intent to turn or change lanes towards that side.|$|R
50|$|A ghost {{light is}} an {{electric}} light {{that is left}} energized {{on the stage of}} a theater when the theater is unoccupied and would otherwise be completely dark. It typically consists of an exposed incandescent bulb, CFL lamp, or LED <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> in a wire cage on a portable light standard. It is usually placed near center stage. Ghost lights are also sometimes known as equity lights or equity lamps, possibly indicating their use was originally mandated by the Actors' Equity Association.|$|R
50|$|In some areas, {{a pair of}} canoes joined {{together}} by planks forming “a catamaran” is used to fish silverfish. A kerosene parafin lamp, attached {{to the middle of}} one of the planks, is lit. Another <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> on a small raft connected to the canoe by a rope of about 15 m long, is also lit and slowly pulled towards the canoe. This attracts the fish to the net. The fish are trapped in the net and the lights extinguished.|$|R
500|$|The Yehudi project {{therefore}} used forward-pointing <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> in the aircraft's {{nose and}} the leading {{edges of the}} wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their brightness controlled by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. [...] One photocell pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp; the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Gone {{were the}} {{distinctive}} [...] "frog-eye" [...] headlights, replaced by flush-mounted headlamps with wraparound marker lenses (which were also {{introduced in the}} other Escort models) and parking <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> below in the bumper region alongside a wide center slot. Ford's blue script oval stood prominently above a single-slot grille. Large 'EXP' recessed lettering was easy to spot on the wide C-pillar. Wraparound full-width taillamps (split by the license plate's recessed housing) were divided into upper/lower segments and tapered downward to a point on each quarter panel.|$|R
25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS light are the casing {{in which the}} internal parts are mounted, an ellipsoidal reflector located {{in the back of}} the casing, a <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. The light from the lamp is efficiently gathered by the ellipsoidal reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|R
500|$|An American version, [...] "Yehudi", using <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> in the aircraft's {{nose and}} the leading {{edges of the}} wings, was trialled in B-24 Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945. By {{directing}} the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the aircraft's skin), the system provided effective counter-illumination camouflage with an affordable use of energy, more like that of marine animals than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. But the system never entered active service, as radar became the principal means of detecting aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Group B {{rallying}} {{was dropped}} {{at the end}} of the 1986 season, but the Delta HF 4WD was not suited to Group A rallying. The Delta HF Turbo became the road car top of the Delta range. There is very little to distinguish the car from the earlier 'Turbo i.e.' apart from the four-headlight system, fog <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> in the front spoiler, 4WD badging on the rear hatch, small side skirts and two raised air intakes on the bonnet (hood). The later car is therefore virtually indistinguishable from the 1.6-litre HF Turbo i.e.|$|R
50|$|In later years, Thomas' rear {{buffer beam}} has {{returned}} to the original higher position, although it is deeper to allow the buffers, coupling hook, and vacuum brake hoses to be in the correct position. Thomas also carries an electric light on the right-hand side of his front buffer beam and a red tail light mounted on the centre of his bunker, whereas the originals had removable kerosene <b>lamps</b> <b>mounted</b> on <b>lamp</b> irons, which Thomas incidentally has, although they are not used but instead included for continuity with the other engines.|$|R

50|$|The 200/201 had myriad {{market and}} model differences. Cuore badged L201's {{received}} a fog lamp {{on the left}} side. Later models of the Mira had fog lamps on both sides. The L201 had two license plate lamps while the L200 had only one. L200 Miras produced for Japan had no rear fog lamps, when sold in the United Kingdom (where Japan spec Miras were also available) they had a rear fog <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> on the right hand side. Despite the Mira badge mostly being available in Right Hand Drive markets, left hand drive Mira-badged L201's were sold in the Dominican Republic.|$|R
5000|$|The police box (along {{with others}} in Edinburgh) was {{designed}} by City Architect Ebenezer MacRae, and manufactured by Carron Ironworks in Falkirk. The new network of police boxes was formally commissioned by the Chief Constable and other dignitaries in 1933. All of the MacRae police boxes featured klaxons and blue flashing lights to alert constables to an incoming message, but the Royal Mile box uniquely featured a [...] "sky lantern", a remote blue <b>lamp</b> <b>mounted</b> at high level {{on the street corner}} of North Bridge and Royal Mile, so as to attract attention across a wider area.|$|R
