50|$|The most {{important}} river {{in terms of}} drinking water supply is the still relatively unpolluted Chaobai River in the East. It is impounded by the Miyun Dam. The Miyun Reservoir provides water to Beijing over a distance of 95 kilometer, initially through an open canal that brings the water to the Huairou Reservoir and then through a ductile iron pipe and three steel pipes to Beijing. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> near the canal is prohibited to prevent accidental pollution. The Miyun Reservoir is the city’s largest single source of water. It also provides water for Beijing’s numerous lakes {{that used to be}} fed by springs that now have dried up. The dam used to also provide water for agriculture, but in 1981 the government decided that its water would only be used for domestic water supply. In 1986 the first plant in Beijing to treat surface water, the 9th water treatment plant, was established to treat water from the Miyun reservoir. As of 2009, it was Asia's largest water treatment plant with a capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters per day (0.55 billion cubic meters per year). While the plant was designed as a surface water treatment plant, when surface water is scarce groundwater is also treated in the same plant. Because of the higher salinity of groundwater and the hardness of surface water this leads to problems in the treatment process, causing limescale and the clogging of pipes.|$|E

40|$|How did the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> across interwar Poland {{react to}} the Polish reunification? After more than 120 years of {{political}} and economic separation, Poland was reunified at the end of 1918. In consequence, the removal of internal tariff barriers and improved infrastructure strengthened the domestic market, while foreign market relations were cut off. Similarly, the geographical distribution of factor endowments was changed, for example through internal migration. How did these forces interact to determine the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry?</b> We survey the dynamics <b>of</b> industrial <b>location</b> between 1902 and 1925 - 1937 and estimate a specification that nests market potential and comparative advantage to quantify their respective impact during the interwar years.

The final section of the Chapter examines the relevance of the major theoretical concepts of industrial location to Sri Lanka. The second Chapter reviews government policy with regard to industrial location. It presents a case for a policy of industrial location and examines the locational implications of the industrial policy in Sri Lanka in its historical perspective. The next section critically evaluates the effectiveness of the current industrial policy as regards the- <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> and finally presents the opinion of the Colombo Municipal Council on the subject of <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> within the City limits. It also observes that the problems of the City should be viewed in a more comprehensive manner. The third Chapter comprised the empirical portion of the study. It justifies the selection of only state ventures and examines the location of the three selected state industrial corporations in terms of locational criteria established in the discussion in Chapter One. The three industries are the Ceylon Ceramics Corporation, She Ceylon Steel Corporation and the State Graphite Corporation., The final section in this Chapter discusses the limitations to the study and critically analyses the merits and demerits of their respective locations accompanied by some observations on tke subject.

Our empirical analysis underscores the significance of discriminatory procurement.

However, it is difficult to explain the real location of logistics facilities by these methods. This {{is due to the fact}} that road network or land use regulation influences on the location of logistics facilities. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the applicability of mathematical models to explain the mechanismfor location and relocation of logistics facilities. This paper tried to analyze the mechanism for the location and relocation of logistics facilities by evolutionary game theory and Markov Chain. In conclusion, it is clarified thatthese mathematical models are useful tools to explain the location and relocation of logistics facilities. 従来物流施設の立地を考えるときは、産業立地論をはじめとした経済立地や、配送距離最小の条件で求めるOR などが主な手法であった。しかし、現実の物流施設の立地は、道路ネットワークや用途地域制などの立地の制約があり、必ずしも理論通りに行かないことがある。本研究では、物流施設の立地について、従来の経済立地論やOR といった考え方以外の手法として、数理モデルの応用可能性を明らかにすることを目的としている。そして、物流施設の集積と移転問題に着目し、ゲーム理論と確率論による説明を試みた。その結果、物流施設の集積や移転をこれら数理モデルにより説明できる可能性を示すことができた。東京海洋大学海洋工学部流通情報工学...|$|E
40|$|What {{accounts}} for {{the differences in the}} economic performance across Italian regions in the post-Unification period? This thesis seeks to explain the regional patterns of economic development and industrialization in Italy in the period 1871 - 1911 by applying various Economic Geography models. The first part follows Overman and Puga (2002) and studies the distribution of industrial employment across regions. The aim is to test the effect of regional borders on the distribution of industrial employment. The existence of this border effect, tested through the use of provincial data, suggests that the Italian regions in this period represented meaningful economic entities. By testing the effect of pre- 1861 borders we link this result to the persistence of pre-Unification institutional arrangements. The second part follows the methodology by Head and Mayer (2011) and investigates the relationship between economic performance and market access. Here market access is captured through market potential, a measure of the centrality of a region based on GDP and transport costs. The main result is that domestic market potential is a strong determinant of GDP per capita while all the formulations of market potential that include trading partners give more mixed results. The last part seeks to explain the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> in Italy in the period 1871 – 1911. The analytical framework takes into account both the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) theory on factor endowment and the New Economic Geography (NEG) theory on access to markets. The methodology used here is based on Midelfart-Knarvik et al. (2000). The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries,</b> measured through employment per region per sector, is explained with interactions between characteristics of the regions and characteristics of the sectors, of both H-O and NEG-type. The main findings of this chapter are that endowments, and in particular human capital, were {{the driving force behind the}} first Italian industrialization while access to markets had a more limited effect...|$|E

40|$|How is European {{integration}} {{changing the}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry?</b> And what part are national and EU aids to industry playing in this process? We show that states and regions {{are becoming more}} specialized within the EU, but this process is very slow. While {{there is no evidence}} of polarization occurring at the national level, some regions are losing out. National state aids to industry appear to have little effect for either good or ill, since their effectiveness at attracting economic activity and employment is limited. European Structural Funds expenditure, by contrast, does have an effect on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> notably by attracting industries that are intensive in research and development. However, this effect has mostly been acting counter to states' comparative advantage - R&D-intensive industries have been encouraged by these aids to locate in countries and regions that have low endowments of skilled labour. Only in Ireland, where Structural Funds reinforced rather than offset comparative advantage, have poor regions been enabled systematically to catch up with the EU average.
