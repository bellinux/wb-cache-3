5000|$|The beta angle (...) is a {{measurement}} {{that is used}} most notably in spaceflight. The beta angle determines the percentage of time an object such as a spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO) spends in direct sunlight, absorbing solar energy. Beta angle {{is defined as the}} angle between the orbital plane of the spacecraft and the vector to the sun (i.e., which direction the Sun is shining from). The beta angle is the smaller angle (there are two angles) between the Sun vector (where the Sun is shining from in the sky) and the plane of the object's orbit. Note that the beta angle does not define a unique orbit plane; all satellites in orbit with a given beta angle at a given altitude have the same exposure to the Sun, even though they may be orbiting in completely different planes around the Earth. The beta angle varies between +90° and −90°, and the direction the satellite revolves around the body it orbits determines whether the beta angle sign is positive or negative. An imaginary observer standing on the Sun defines a beta angle as positive if the satellite in question orbits in a counter clockwise direction and negative if it revolves clockwise. The maximum amount of time that a satellite in a normal <b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>mission</b> can spend in the Earth's shadow occurs at a beta angle of zero. In such an orbit, the satellite is in sunlight no more than 59% of the time.|$|E

40|$|Time Delay and Integration (TDI) {{is used to}} {{increase}} the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in image sensors when imaging fast moving objects. One important TDI application is in Earth observation from space. In order {{to operate in the}} space radiation environment, the effect that radiation damage has on the performance of the image sensors must be understood. This work looks at prototype TDI sensor pixel designs, produced by e 2 v technologies. The sensor is a CCD-like charge transfer device, allowing in-pixel charge summation, produced on a CMOS process. The use of a CMOS process allows potential advantages such as lower power consumption, smaller pixels, higher line rate and extra on-chip functionality which can simplify system design. CMOS also allows a dedicated output amplifier per column allowing fewer charge transfers and helping to facilitate higher line rates than CCDs.

40|$|The Multi-spacecraft Autonomous Positioning System {{enables a}} solar-system wide {{navigation}} capability. This architecture takes {{advantages of a}} growing interplanetary communication network. The spacecraft, as well as ground-based assets, share best estimated position and velocity, through embedded navigation packets. Combined with timing observations, this supports onboard autonomous state estimation. Through simulation-based analysis, this architecture {{has been shown to}} maintain state estimation accuracy during a Martian cruise while reducing the need for Earth-based state updates. The current stage of this research is development of a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation to further analyze this architecture. This allows for embedding of space-capable (and space-flown) components into a multi-agent hardware simulation. This demonstration of the architecture is used to both verify the simulation results, as well as to provide a proving ground and experimental test-bed for flight software development, evaluation, and algorithm optimization.

40|$|Built by the Lockheed-Martin Corporation, the Earth Observing System (EOS) TERRA {{spacecraft}} {{represents the}} first orbiting {{application of a}} 120 Vdc high voltage spacecraft electrical power system implemented by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The EOS TERRA spacecraft's launch provided a major contribution to the NASA Mission to Planet Earth program while incorporating many {{state of the art}} electrical power system technologies to achieve its mission goals. The EOS TERRA spacecraft was designed around five state-of-the-art scientific instrument packages designed to monitor key parameters associated with the earth's climate. The development focus of the TERRA electrical power system (EPS) resulted from a need for high power distribution to the EOS TERRA spacecraft subsystems and instruments and minimizing mass and parasitic losses. Also important as a design goal of the EPS was maintaining tight regulation on voltage and achieving low conducted bus noise characteristics. This paper outlines the major requirements for the EPS as well as the resulting hardware implementation approach adopted {{to meet the demands of}} the EOS TERRA <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>mission.</b> The selected orbit, based on scientific needs, to achieve the EOS TERRA mission goals is a sun-synchronous circular 98. 2 degree inclination Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with a near circular average altitude of 705 kilometers. The nominal spacecraft orbit is approximately 99 minutes with an average eclipse period of about 34 minutes. The scientific goal of the selected orbit is to maintain a repeated 10 : 30 a. m. +/- 15 minute descending equatorial crossing which provides a fairly clear view of the earth's surface and relatively low cloud interference for the instrument observation measurements. The major EOS TERRA EPS design requirements are single fault tolerant, average orbit power delivery of 2, 530 watts with a defined minimum lifetime of five years (EOL). To meet these mission requirements, while minimizing mass and parasitic power losses, the EOS TERRA project relies on 36, 096 high efficiency Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) on Germanium solar cells adhered to a deployable flexible solar array designed to provide over 5, 000 watts of power at EOL. To meet the eclipse power demands of the spacecraft, EOS TERRA selected an application of two 54 -cell series connected Individual Pressure Vessel (IPV) Nickel-Hydrogen (NiH 2) 50 Ampere-Hour batteries. All of the spacecraft observatory electrical power is controlled via the TERRA Power Distribution Unit (PDU) which is designed to provide main bus regulation of 120 Vdc +/- - 4 % at all load interfaces through the implementation of majority voter control of both the spacecraft's solar array sequential shunt unit (SSU) and the two battery bi-directional charge and discharge regulators. This paper will review the major electrical power system requirement drivers for the EOS TERRA mission as well as some of the challenges encountered during the development, testing, and implementation of the power system. In addition, spacecraft test and early on orbit performance results will also be covered...|$|E
