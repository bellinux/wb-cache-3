25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is situated}} on {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada between the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl and in the Moctezuma-Panuco River. The Sierra Nevada is the most important geographical feature of the region and forms the eastern border of the municipality. These volcanoes are responsible for the compositions of the soils here as well as the source of most of the municipality’s fresh water. The average altitude in these mountains is 4,000 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. Although near the active volcano, Amecameca is considered to be at a lower risk than other communities in the area because of the shape of Popocatépetl’s cone and the large ravines that are found in this area. The latter offers protection against lava flows and runoff from melting snow. However, the area remains part of the evacuation zone {{in the event of a}} major eruption. There is a <b>lookout</b> <b>station</b> on Sacromonte hill which is used by civil defense when the volcano is more active. The area has an eruption warning system of three colors—red, yellow and green—which depend on the status of Popocatepetl. Green means that the volcano is quiet, yellow that there is activity and caution is advised and red indicates a current or imminent eruption. When the status turns to yellow, tourism to the area plummets to about half normal.|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{commanding}} {{view of the}} harbor, {{the roof}} of the warehouse has long been the site of various operations. [...] Starting in the early 1920s, the Marine Exchange operated on its roof, providing lookout reports on ships entering and leaving the port. [...] In 1925, the Radio Corporation of America located its harbor receiving station {{to the top of the}} massive warehouse. [...] A new four-room <b>lookout</b> <b>station</b> for use by the Marine Exchange was built in 1928 atop the warehouse. [...] The new station had a large circular window giving telescopes a commanding view of the harbor and ocean, and also included a neon red beacon which shed a red glow over the building at night. [...] In 1939, the Los Angeles Times described the Exchange as [...] "a world all its own up there on Warehouse No. 1." [...] In eight-hour shifts, three men manned the Exchange, climbing seven flights of stairs to reach the <b>lookout</b> <b>station.</b> [...] The Times described the station as follows: [...] "In one room with big windows commanding every approach from the sea, there is a large telescope on wheels. [...] It can be pointed in any direction with the touch of a finger. [...] At a little desk looking out over the channel and the harbor sits one of the three men who are on duty as lookouts ..." [...] During World War II, as blackout rules were applied along the coast, the Marine Exchange ceased operations but resumed its lookout operations atop the warehouse in late 1945. [...] In 1964, a new 26 x [...] perch was built atop the warehouse for use by the Marine Exchange. The roof was also the site of a weather observation and signal facility for many years.|$|E
