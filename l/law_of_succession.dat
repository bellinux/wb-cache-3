25|$|It was in {{the years}} after the death of King Olaf 'the Holy' in 1030 that Norway was finally Christianised, whereby the Church {{gradually}} began to play a political rôle. Already in 1163 the <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> stated that Norwegian kings were no longer sovereign monarchs but vassals holding Norway as a fief from Saint Olaf alias the Eternal King of Norway. This invention gave the Church bigger control of the royal power, not least because the King had to proclaim loyalty to the Pope. King Magnus V (11561184) was as such the first of Norway's kings to use the style 'by the Grace of God'. Nevertheless, this <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> would last only for a century, when a new and for kings more independent <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> was introduced.|$|E

For periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings. The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king.

25|$|Since the {{elevation}} of Vice King Pinklao by his brother King Mongkut (Rama IV) twenty years earlier, the office of Front Palace had gained considerable amount of power and prestige. Since Siam {{did not have a}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> the position of Vice King was seen as the strongest claimant and was therefore also the position of the heir presumptive to the throne. The Vice King also had his own army of over 2,000 men, western trained and western armed. He also controlled a naval forces of several steam powered gunboats. The Prince also had a large share of state revenues over one-third of which is given directly to him for the maintenance of his officials, retinue, court, concubines and advisors.|$|E
25|$|King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) abdicated in 1935 due to {{political}} quarrels {{with the new}} quasi-democratic government as well as health problems. The king decided to abstain from exercising his prerogative to name a successor to the throne. By that time, the crown had already passed from Prince Mahidol's line to that of his half-brother's when his eldest full brother, Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis, died as a teenager during King Chulalongkorn's reign. A half-brother, Prince Vajiravudh (as the next eldest) replaced Prince Vajirunhis as the crown prince. He eventually succeeded to the throne in 1910 as King Rama VI. In 1924 the king instituted the Palace <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Succession</b> in order to govern subsequent successions. The law gave priority {{to the children of}} his mother Queen Regent Saovabha Phongsri over the children of King Chulalongkorn's two other royal wives. The law was enacted on the death of King Vajiravudh in 1925 and the crown passed to his youngest brother, Prince Prajadhipok of Sukhothai.|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is: The Customary <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Intestate <b>Succession.</b> The African {{customary}} law relating to intestate succession has always been known to discriminate against women. The thesis therefore focuses on the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> in the countries of South Africa, Ghana and Swaziland and the inroads they have made in improving {{the rights of women}} in this discriminatory field <b>of</b> African customary <b>law.</b> This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the topic of the research. It highlights the organisation of the intended research which comprises: a statement of the problem, the legal framework, research methodology and a summary of the chapter. Chapter 2 defines the general terms and concepts used in the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession.</b> This facilitates an understanding of the general principles comprising the body <b>of</b> <b>law</b> known as the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> and lays the foundation for the country specific issues that are investigated in the following chapters. Chapter 3 discusses the recognition, application and development <b>of</b> the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> in the country of South Africa. Chapter 4 considers the rules and <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> in the West African country of Ghana. Chapter 5 explains the current rules and <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> prevailing in the Kingdom of Swaziland. Finally, chapter 6 brings the thesis to a meaningful end, by criticizing the approaches adopted by the countries of South Africa, Ghana and Swaziland in improving the rights of women as far as the customary <b>law</b> <b>of</b> intestate <b>succession</b> is concerned. The chapter also presents various recommendations for improving the rights of women in this discriminatory field <b>of</b> the <b>law.</b> Public, Constitutional, and InternationalLL. D...|$|R

25|$|After King Pinklao's {{death in}} 1866, King Mongkut {{decided not to}} appoint another Front Palace {{due to the fact}} that his own son Prince Chulalongkorn was only 12 years old. This meant that the {{position}} which was also that of the heir presumptive was left unoccupied (Siam had no <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> at the time, but the Vice King was seen as the strongest claimant). Fearing instability, Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag) the Kalahom (one of the Prime Ministers of Siam) tried to persuade the King to appoint Prince Yodyingyot to succeed King Pinklao. Si Suriyawongse was a member of the powerful Bunnag family, which had dominated the running of the Siamese government since the reign of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II). The King refused to appoint Yodyingyot, instead he elevated the Prince to Krom Muen Bowon Wichaichan or Prince Bowon Wichaichan in 1867. This meant Wichaichan was only made a Prince of the Front Palace but not the actual title of Front Palace. Since 1865 the Prince was also the commander of the Front Palace's naval forces.|$|E
25|$|Frederick VII's childlessness had {{presented}} a thorny dilemma {{and the question}} of succession to the Danish throne proved problematic. Denmark's adherence to the Salic Law and a burgeoning nationalism within the German-speaking parts of Schleswig-Holstein hindered all hopes of a peaceful solution. Proposed resolutions to keep the two Duchies together and part of Denmark proved unsatisfactory to both Danish and German interests. While Denmark had adopted the Salic Law, this only affected the descendants of Frederick III of Denmark, who was the first hereditary monarch of Denmark (before him, the kingdom was officially elective). Agnatic descent from Frederick III would end with the death of the childless King Frederick VII and his equally childless uncle, Prince Ferdinand. At that point, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> promulgated by Frederick III provided for a Semi-Salic succession. There were, however, several ways to interpret to whom the crown could pass, since the provision was not entirely clear as to whether a claimant to the throne could be the closest female relative or not.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} politics, Magnus {{carried out}} a great effort to modernise the law-code, which gave him his epithet law-mender. These were adopted at the Things in the years 1274 (Landslov) and 1276 (Byloven). In 1274 he promulgated the new national law, a unified code of laws {{to apply for the}} whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland. This replaced the different regional laws which had existed before. It was supplemented by a new municipal law (a law for the cities) in 1276, and a slightly modified version was also drawn up for Iceland. A unified code of laws for a whole country was at this time something quite new, which had until then only been introduced in Sicily and Castile. His code introduced the concept that crime is an offense against the state rather than against the individual and thus narrowed the possibilities of personal vengeance. It increased the formal power of the king, making the throne the source of justice. The municipal law gave the cities increased freedom from rural control. A specific section fixed the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> to the throne, in accordance with the arrangements laid down by King Håkon Håkonsson in 1260.|$|E

25|$|In 1502, {{the members}} of the Aragonese Cortes {{gathered}} in Zaragoza, and Parliaments of the Kingdom of Valencia and the Principality of Catalonia in Barcelona, as members of the Crown of Aragon, swore an oath of loyalty to their daughter Joanna as heiress, but Alonso de Aragón, Archbishop of Saragossa, stated firmly that this oath was invalid and did not change the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> which could only be done by formal legislation by the Cortes with the King. So, when King Ferdinand died on 23 January 1516, his daughter Joanna inherited the Crown of Aragon, and his grandson Charles became Governor General (regent). Nevertheless, the Flemish wished that Charles assume the royal title, and this was supported by his paternal grandfather the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and by Pope Leo X. Consequently, after Ferdinand II's funeral on 14 March 1516, Charles I was proclaimed King of Castile and of Aragon jointly with his mother. Finally, the Castilian Regent, Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros accepted the fait accompli, and the Castilian and Aragonese Cortes paid homage to him as King of Aragon jointly with his mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} Erling {{and the rest}} of his party in electing Magnus Erlingsson as their leader was a radical one, as it broke with one of the {{traditional}} principles of who might become king: Magnus was not a king's son. He was only descended from the ancient royal line through his mother. To compensate for this shortcoming, Erling and Magnus' party allied themselves with the Church and introduced a new criterion: the king should henceforth be of legitimate birth. Their old leader, Inge Crouchback, had been the only one of the sons of Harald Gille to be legitimate, and King Magnus Erlingsson was also Erling and Kristin's legitimate son. The alliance with the Church, which had recently become better organized in Norway after the establishment of a separate Norwegian archdiocese in Nidaros in 1152, became an important asset for Erling and Magnus. In 1163 in Bergen, Magnus Erlingsson became the first Norwegian king to be crowned, aged 7. A written <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> was also introduced which only allowed the oldest legitimate son to inherit. For the next decade or so, Magnus Erlingsson's position as king, with Erling Skakke as the real leader of the country, seemed secure. Erling ruthlessly eliminated any potential rivals to his son. He was also allied at times with King Valdemar I of Denmark, and according to one source he at one time took the Oslofjord-area as a fief from him. However, the extent of his subordination to Denmark is questionable.|$|E

500|$|The table below lists Ottoman sultans, {{as well as}} {{the last}} Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or {{signatures}} used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The [...] "Notes" [...] column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as [...] "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor. In 1617, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( [...] ekberiyet), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.|$|E

The 'office of The Queen' includes the Sovereign's constitutional status, powers and rights in Canada. Neither the ban on the marriages of heirs to Roman Catholics, nor the common law governing male preference primogeniture, can properly be said to be royal powers or prerogatives in Canada.
