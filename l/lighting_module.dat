40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional underwater light sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the luminous intensity is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an underwater LED <b>lighting</b> <b>module</b> is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the underwater light field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED {{luminous intensity distribution curve}} (LIDC) and axial luminous intensity.

The fabrication of large emission area OLEDs for lighting application at reasonable costs is essential to achieve a large market penetration. To reach this target, an improved combination of manufacturing technology has to be established. A key aspect is the OLED scaling to large area without high efficacy loss. Based on the limited conductivity of ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide) improved current distribution methods have to be developed to achieve a homogeneous large area lighting. We here present such novel designs of metal support line structures which allow large area lighting with small efficacy losses. Highly efficient large area white lighting modules with 25 Im/W efficacy and more than 125 cm² active area will be shown. Based on this lighting integration technology, one of the largest SM-OLED <b>lighting</b> <b>module</b> with 30 x 30 cm² dimension (subdivided in 4 panels) will be presented. The OLED active area is 510 cm², the light outputs is 160 Lumen. A second key issue is to reduce the cost for the OLED lighting manufacturing. ITO as the most common electrode material has dramatically increased in prices over the last years. We have successfully replaced ITO by TAO (aluminum doped zinc oxide) and PEDOT: PSS new materials for the alternative transparent anode.

The various SHAAL applications run on different platforms which areWindows,Webbased and Android based smartphone. Since many applications may run on SHAAL network, a simple data scheduling scheme has been programmed to schedule data packets based on their application types and priorities.

40|$|CODYRUN is a multi-zone {{software}} integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer. A {{first question}} thus arose {{as to the}} integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, {{a comparison of the}} model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings. Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a <b>lighting</b> <b>module</b> to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5 - 14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe. Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].
