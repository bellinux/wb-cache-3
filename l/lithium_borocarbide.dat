40|$|The {{search for}} {{superconductivity}} in materials iso-structural and iso-electronic with magnesium diboride, MgB 2, has not yielded results with Tc near 39 K. In particular, <b>Lithium</b> <b>borocarbide,</b> LiBC, and its modification Li 0. 5 BC, {{proved to be}} non-superconducting. Using our materials-specific condition for superconductivity and the symmetry principles for superconductor search, we show that LiBC cannot be a superconductor. By replacing C in LiBC with Si we achieve valence electron count (Ne) and atomic number (Z) symmetry with MgB 2. We therefore predict that Lithium boron silicon, LiBSi, should be a superconductor with Tc comparable to MgB 2. Comment: 1 Tabl...|$|E
40|$|The layered <b>lithium</b> <b>borocarbide</b> LiBC, isovalent {{with and}} {{structurally}} {{similar to the}} superconductor MgB 2, is an insulator due to the modulation within the hexagonal layers (BC vs. B 2). We show that hole-doping of LiBC results in Fermi surfaces of B-C p sigma character that couple very strongly to B-C bond stretching modes, precisely the features that lead to superconductivity at Tc = 40 K in MgB 2. Comparison of Li{ 0. 5 }BC with MgB 2 indicates the former to be a prime candidate for electron-phonon coupled superconductivity at substantially higher temperature than in MgB 2.

40|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>borocarbide,</b> LiBC, {{a member}} of the Z = 4. 67 family of materials, is not a superconductor. Using ternary {{combinations}} of elements that give Z = 4. 67 and the material specific characterization dataset (MSCD) scheme, we discover other members of this family. We predict that most of them will not be superconducting and offer an explanation in terms of valence electrons and atomic number ratios. We propose that by appropriately increasing the atomic number while keeping the valence electron count constant, we can transform them into MgB 2 -like superconductors. We show some examples of such transformations. Alternatively, reducing the valence electron count to 2 while keeping Z constant may lead to high-Tc in the Z= 4. 67 family.

40|$|The {{existence}} of stable layered bulk allotropes {{can be an}} indication for the {{existence of}} corresponding stable tubular structures. Using a density functional tight binding method we demonstrate that charged borocarbide (BC) nanotubes, which are isoelectronic with layered <b>lithium</b> or copper <b>borocarbide,</b> are stable and energetically viable. The discussed structures are semiconducting with an energy gap which decreases with diameter. The size of the gap also depends on the helicity of the tubes, and is always smaller for tubes with armchair (n,n) and zig-zag (3 n, 0) symmetry than for tubes with other symmetries. Hole doping and its effects on the electronic structure of BC⁽⁻⁾ layers and tubes is also discussed...|$|R
