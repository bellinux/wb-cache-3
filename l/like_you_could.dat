With {{the help of her}} mother's colleagues in theatre, including ZaSu Pitts, Walter Huston, and Spencer Tracy, she pursued a professional career as an actress. She first gained a part in Pitts' 1945 road tour of Ramshackle Inn, moving to New York City. She landed the role of Si-Tchun, a lady-in-waiting, in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient, Lute Song, starring Mary Martin and a pre-fame Yul Brynner. The show's producer told her, [...] "You look <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be Chinese." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan first {{pitched the}} film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but then felt that he needed more {{experience}} making large-scale films, and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because [...] "as soon as you're talking about dreams, {{the potential of the}} human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go anywhere {{by the end of the}} film. And it has to work on a massive scale." [...] After making The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script. Nolan states that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. [...] "Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences." ...|$|E

[...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes. Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song [...] "dimensional, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> actually put your hands through the song." [...] "Synthesizer" [...] contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton. Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track [...] "raw and woozy", dubbing it the [...] "weirdest moment of the record". On the seventh track, [...] "Slump", Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. One of the few tracks that doesn’t have Andre on it, since he is the [...] "unique" [...] one of the group, while Big Boi is more of the traditional gangster. On [...] "West Savannah", Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating [...] "You might call us country, but we's only Southern".|$|E

"Tell me," [...] a girl asked him, as he stooped {{over her}} fingers to say good night, [...] "is it really true, Mr. Saton, that if <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make me do things even against my will--that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put ideas into my head which I {{should be forced to}} carry out?" ...|$|R

500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E
