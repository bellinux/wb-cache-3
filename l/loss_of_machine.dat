40|$|We {{present some}} recent results on two {{innovative}} applications of microelectronics technology to dust inventory measurement and dust removal in ITER. A novel device {{to detect the}} settling of dust particles on a remote surface has been developed in the laboratory. A circuit board with a grid of two interlocking conductive traces with 25 μm spacing is biased to 30 – 50 V. Carbon particles landing on the energized grid create a transient short circuit. The current flowing through the short circuit creates a voltage pulse that is recorded by standard nuclear counting electronics and {{the total number of}} counts is related to the mass of dust impinging on the grid. The particles typically vaporize in a few seconds restoring the previous voltage standoff. Experience on NSTX however, showed that in a tokamak environment it was still possible for large particles or fibers to remain on the grid causing a long term short circuit. We report on the development of a gas puff system that uses helium to clear such particles. Experiments with varying nozzle designs, backing pressures, puff durations, and exit flow orientations have given an optimal configuration that effectively removes particles from an area up to 25 cm² with a single nozzle. In a separate experiment we are developing an advanced circuit grid of three interlocking traces that can generate a miniature electrostatic traveling wave for transporting dust to a suitable exit port. We have fabricated such a 3 -pole circuit board with 25 micron insulated traces that operates with voltages up to 200 V. Recent results showed motion of dust particles with the application of only 50 V bias voltage. Such a device could potentially remove dust continuously without dedicated interventions and without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>machine</b> availability for plasma operations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the slot/pole (S/P) combination on inter-turn short-circuit (SC) current in fault-tolerant permanent magnet (FT-PM) machines. A 2 -D sub-domain field computational model with multi-objective genetic algorithm is used for the design and performance prediction of the considered FT-PM <b>machines.</b> The electromagnetic <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>machines,</b> including iron, magnet, and winding losses are systematically computed using analytical tools. During the postprocessing stage, a 1 -D analysis is employed for turn-turn fault analysis. The method calculates self-and mutual inductances of both the faulty and healthy turns under an SC fault condition with respect to the fault locations, and thus SC fault current, considering its location. Eight FT-PM machines with different S/P combinations are analyzed. Both the performance <b>of</b> the <b>machine</b> during normal operation and induced currents during a turn-turn SC fault are investigated. To evaluate the thermal impact of each S/P combination under an inter-turn fault condition, a thermal analysis is performed using finite element computation. It is shown that low-rotor-pole-number machines have a better fault tolerance capability, while high-rotor-pole-number machines are lighter and provide higher efficiency.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{performance analysis}} <b>of</b> multiphase <b>machines.</b> There {{has been a}} growing interest in multiphase machines due to their fault tolerant feature which is suitable for reliability sensitive applications like aerospace, hybrid vehicles and traction. There {{is a need to}} study different aspects <b>of</b> these <b>machines</b> in further detail for commercial realization. In this report, FEM simulation results <b>of</b> multiphase <b>machines</b> are presented with focus on the 6 -phase machines. A comprehensive comparison <b>of</b> multiphase <b>machines</b> in general and the 6 -phase machine in particular has been presented. In the 6 -phase machines, there are no contributions of the 5 th, 7 th, 17 th and 19 th harmonics from the stator. This feature eliminates 6 th and 18 th torque pulsations and rotor surface losses are reduced. Total <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the 6 -phase machines are usually lower. However amount <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> reduction is topology dependant. In induction machines, loss reduction can be variable depending upon star or delta connection. Loss reduction in PM machines is rotor design dependant. Low order MMF harmonics from the stator are further eliminated with increasing phase number. The value of THD drops when going from a 3 -phase to a 12 -phase machine. The 6 -phase synchronous machine is evaluated in further depth which shows drop in damper bar losses for sinusoidal supply when analyzing affects of possible supply angle mismatch from the converter. It is shown that the 6 -phase machine is sensitive to supply angle mismatch. Total <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>machine</b> increase with increase of deviation from 30 degrees supply angle. A comprehensive study is made on the influences of parameters, such as winding layout, wedge material properties and rotor pole shape of a 3 -phase synchronous machine and results are compared with the 6 -phase machine. Both machines are already well optimized for individual parameters. However, from space harmonics point of view, use of short pitch, magnetic wedge and arched pole is helpful to reduce rotor surface losses with a slight increase <b>of</b> total <b>losses.</b> The 6 -phase machine is more suited to these changes. Although, total <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>machine</b> are slightly higher, yet there is a decrease <b>of</b> rotor surface <b>losses.</b> A detailed study of the induction and the PM machine is suggested as future work...|$|R
