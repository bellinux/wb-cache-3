25|$|New Zealand has {{completed}} three notably <b>large</b> <b>run</b> chases in Chappell–Hadlee Trophy matches. In the third ODI in 2005–06 in Christchurch, New Zealand successfully chased Australia's total of 332, setting {{a new record}} for the highest run chase in ODI history; this record was surpassed by South Africa later in the 2005–06 season. Then, in the 2006–07 series, New Zealand successfully chased 336 in the second ODI in Auckland, and successfully chased 346 in the third ODI in Hamilton. For a time, these three matches were the second, third and fourth-highest run chases in ODI history.|$|E
25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to <b>large</b> <b>run</b> publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until you reach production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a dozen or more workers.|$|E

50|$|The Oyster River {{itself is}} a popular {{swimming}} and fishing spot all throughout the summer months. There is access at Highway 19, 19a, 19b (old bridge), York Road. The Oyster River estuary, {{as well as the}} entire oceanfront of the community, are home to a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> of pink salmon that return every year.|$|E

In a controversial 1871 election, a recount found Parker and Munro had split the vote equally; the returning officer's casting vote returned Monro as MP, but this was overturned following a petition, and Parker was declared elected.|$|E

5000|$|The Alsea Hatchery, {{constructed}} by the state in 1936, raises winter steelhead and other rainbow trout along the North Fork. According to Fishing in Oregon, the river is a [...] "beautiful stream (well-suited to fly angling) with a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> of hatchery winter steelhead." [...] The stream also supports populations of wild cutthroat trout. It is closed to salmon fishing or fishing from a floating device.|$|E

Publishing in this manner meant the company would not go into debt to print a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> of rulebooks and push them into brick-and-mortar stores, and that future updates to the rules could be easily made and disseminated. BTRC allows purchasers to get free upgrades for life on all titles.|$|E
50|$|Medway River is a {{river in}} Queen's County, on the Southwestern shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. At 121 {{kilometres}} long, {{it is one}} of the major rivers of Nova Scotia and once supported a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> of Atlantic salmon. Historically, it was an important corridor to the interior waters of Nova Scotia such as Ponhook and Molega Lakes and as a log driving river for the lumber industry.|$|E

50|$|Eulachon, as {{anadromous}} fish, {{spend most}} of their adult lives in the ocean but return to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn and die. As such, one stream may see regular <b>large</b> <b>runs</b> of eulachon while a neighboring stream sees few or none at all. Regular annual runs are common but not entirely predictable, and occasionally a river which has <b>large</b> <b>runs</b> sees a year with no returns; the reasons for such variability are not known. The eulachon run is characteristic for the early portion being almost entirely male, with females following about midway through the run to its conclusion. Males are easily distinguished from females during spawning by fleshy ridges which form along the length of their bodies.|$|R

50|$|Many {{rivers and}} canals, {{none of them}} very <b>large,</b> <b>run</b> in a general South-to-North direction, {{converging}} into a single river near Bevagna. Their courses are by now highly artificial, the result of land and water management projects undertaken over many centuries, since they are recorded at least {{as early as the}} time of Theodoric the Great (6th century) and have continued down to our own time with the construction of dams and works to regularize the seasonal waters of the Marroggia that had been subject to frequent torrential overflows with sudden and disastrous results.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the colony of South Australia in 1836, the region between the coast and the Murray River was rapidly being settled by squatters selecting <b>large</b> <b>runs</b> for sheep grazing.

50|$|The {{area was}} {{explored}} by Breal Bennett in 1817 and Thomas Mitchell in 1836. The 'Condoublin' run {{was established by}} 1844. There had been squatters in the district since Mitchell's 1836 exploration. Closer settlement of the area began in 1880 when the <b>large</b> <b>runs</b> were broken up into smaller holdings.|$|R

5000|$|In 1841, John [...] "Tinker" [...] Campbell {{was one of}} {{the first}} squatters to settle on the Darling Downs; taking up a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> he named Westbrook. Subsequent owners built a {{substantial}} homestead at Westbrook in 1867 following a period of considerable prosperity. Westbrook Homestead illustrates the pattern of early European exploration and settlement of Queensland where the development of pastoral properties preceded agriculture and the establishment of towns. As an early homestead on the Darling Downs, it has associations with the development of the pastoral industry in Queensland.|$|E

50|$|A French Lop {{is able to}} {{live outside}} and inside; a large {{waterproof}} hutch that shelters the rabbit from any rain, snow, or heat is acceptable with a run attached. French Lops do not handle heat well, so {{make sure they have}} adequate protection like a frozen water bottle or a fan. If kept inside, a hutch or a cage can be used. It is infinitely preferable to keep rabbits in pairs - you should only ever consider getting a single rabbit if you can spend several hours a day with them. The rabbits should have a <b>large</b> <b>run</b> for exercise and mental stimulation - lack of exercise can contribute to obesity, gut stasis and behavioural issues.|$|E
50|$|Several hundred white beluga whales {{concentrate}} {{in an area}} {{extending from}} the Little Susitna River to the Beluga River, between late May and June. The beluga gather in these nearshore waters to calve, breed, and feed on the <b>large</b> <b>runs</b> of eulachon (“hooligan”) fish that return to spawn in the Susitna River.|$|R

The Rio Chama, is very wide at this point, with <b>large</b> <b>runs,</b> pools, and <b>large</b> boulders that create excellent fishing opportunities for rainbow and wild brown trout.|$|R
