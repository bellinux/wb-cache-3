5|$|Istanbul {{is famous}} for its nightlife, as well as its {{historic}} taverns, a signature characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia. Along the İstiklal Avenue is the Çiçek Pasajı, now home to winehouses (known as meyhanes), pubs, and restaurants. İstiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has shifted toward shopping, but the nearby Nevizade Street is still <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> winehouses and pubs. Some other neighborhoods around İstiklal Avenue have recently been revamped to cater to Beyoğlu's nightlife, with formerly commercial streets now <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> pubs, cafes, and restaurants playing live music.

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds have a {{tocopherol}} profile {{dominated by}} alpha-tocopherol. The {{objective of this}} research was to study the dynamics of tocopherol accumulation in sunflower <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> altered total tocopherol content or tocopherol profile. Developing seeds were sampled at regular intervals in two <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> reduced and increased total tocopherol content, respectively, and six <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> modified tocopherol profiles. The <b>line</b> <b>with</b> reduced tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate reduced by half, whereas the <b>line</b> <b>with</b> increased tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate twofold higher than the control. In the three cases, alpha-tocopherol followed a sigmoid accumulation pattern. Modified tocopherol profiles were expressed at early stages of tocopherol accumulation. In most <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> modified profiles, tocopherol accumulation pattern differed from the alpha-tocopherol <b>lines,</b> <b>with</b> maximum tocopherol content at 18 or 21 days after flowering (DAF) that was reduced to reach a plateau from 33 or 36 DAF onward. Such a reduction was caused by continued dry matter accumulation after tocopherol accumulation ceased or slowed down. In <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> increased levels of beta-tocopherol or both gamma- and delta-tocopherol, the synthesis of beta- and delta-tocopherol started and stopped earlier than the synthesis of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, respectively. © 2013 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.
