25|$|The first pojama {{was built}} in 1764 (the same year as the larger version turumas and the {{earliest}} hemmema). It was a low-hulled vessel with two masts, a main and a mizzen, rigged <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> ketch with two square sails, a lug sail, and three staysails supported between the mainmast and the bowsprit. The first pojama was 23.8 m (78 ft) long, 5.5 m (18 ft) wide, with a draft of 1.8 m (6 ft). The three later pojamas built for the Swedish navy varied in size from 20 m (65.5 ft) up to 27.6 m (90.5 ft). Its main armament was two heavy guns in the bow and stern (ranging from 12-pounders up to 24-pounders). These could also be dragged towards {{the center of the}} vessel and aimed sideways, though with considerable effort. It also had up to 10 swivel guns along the railings for close-range defense. For maneuverability, it carried 14 pairs of oars which operated through oarpoarts attached to a rectangular outrigger which improved the leverage for the oarsmen.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E

His crew chief Mike Ford revealed Hamlin's right-rear tire had been cut on the run before his crash which Hamlin later attributed to running over debris on track. Vickers described his right-front tire failure saying: [...] "It sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> exploded." [...] Goodyear's product manager Rick Heinrich said the tires used in the race were the same from the Aaron's 499, and conducted {{an analysis of the}} tire failures at their plant in Akron, Ohio. Edwards admitted he was at fault for causing the crash between himself and teammate Biffle on lap 174, and apologized to the drivers caught up in the incident. Biffle revealed he was unable to steer his Ford away from the incident.|$|E

500|$|On April 23, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song, [...] "a cheery little tune about death, {{destruction and}} the end of the world" [...] was the result of Scotti Brothers Records' insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was [...] "a little different from what they were expecting." [...] After the song's release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to [...] "most people [...] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season." [...] Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term [...] "ground zero" [...] was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of those attacks took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the Bronx, New York that looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> had gone off. The final original that was recorded was [...] "Good Enough for Now", a country music pastiche about how the singer's lover, who, while not the best, will do for now.|$|E

2500|$|The early fire lance, {{considered}} to be the ancestor of firearms, is not considered a true gun because it did not include projectiles. Later on, shrapnel such as ceramics and bits of iron were added, but these didn't occlude the barrel, and were only swept along with the discharge rather than make use of windage. These projectiles were called [...] "co-viatives." [...] The commonplace nature of the fire lance, if not in quantity, was apparent by the mid 13th century, and in 1257 an arsenal in Jiankang Prefecture reported the manufacture of 333 [...] "fire emitting tubes" [...] (突火筒). In 1259 a type of [...] "fire-emitting lance" [...] (突火槍) made an appearance and according to the History of Song: [...] "It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (子窠). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bomb</b> that can be heard for five hundred or more paces." [...] The pellet wad mentioned is possibly the first true bullet in recorded history depending on how bullet is defined, as it did occlude the barrel, unlike previous co-viatives used in the fire lance.|$|E
