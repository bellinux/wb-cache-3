40|$|How do men and women's family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> differ? Are gender {{differences}} in family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> greater at higher or lower educational levels? And how does the intersection of gender, education and family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> vary across different macro-structural contexts? This paper addresses these questions comparing East and West Germany during the German division (1961 - 1990). We thereby compare a strong male breadwinner model in a social market economy in West Germany and a universal breadwinner model in a state socialist system in the East. The analysis uses data from the German National Education Panel (NEPS) and employs two new sequence analysis tools: sequence discrepancy analysis and the implicative statistic for analyzing sequences of typical states. These tools enable us to scrutinize the degree, content, and timing of differences in family trajectories {{between men and women}} of different educational levels in the two sub-societies. In line with our expectations, family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> were more de-standardized in the West compared to the East, and this occurred to the same extent for men and women in both contexts. While we find moderate {{gender differences}} in family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> across all educational groups in the strong male breadwinner context in West Germany, for East Germany gender differences were significant among the medium and lower educated, but not among the highly educated. These findings underline the fact that the intersection of gender and education for family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> is highly context-specific. They further suggest that different patterns of assortative mating play a key role for {{gender differences in}} family <b>life</b> <b>courses.</b> We demonstrate the added value of sequence discrepancy analysis and the implicative statistic to illuminate differences in longitudinal <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> between men and women or other social groups...|$|R

40|$|People's {{senses of}} belongingness during {{everyday}} encounters with difference are revealing {{of how people}} live with and {{relate to each other}} in diversified society. However, little is known about how people's <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> and daily activities affect their belongingness during encounters. Based on research in a diversified neighbourhood in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, this paper shows that people's <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> and daily mobility interrelate to bring about senses of belongingness. <b>Life</b> <b>courses</b> and daily activities converge during encounters to influence a relational differentiation of Self and others that leads to varying senses of belongingness, including exclusion. This situational process represents the plurality and dynamism of, and structuration, in diversified society.

Much discussion has been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E
25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest doing very little. After the first 3 idle days, workers can be told from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp that leaves the nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent on ones role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s <b>life</b> <b>course.</b> Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E

25|$|Common market health {{measures}} such as GDP and GNP {{have been used as}} a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been {{explained by the fact that}} the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the <b>life</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s <b>life</b> <b>course</b> for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E
25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development {{of children in the}} Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's <b>life</b> <b>course</b> is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E

40|$|Social life in Japan {{has been}} {{historically}} orientated towards hierarchical networks of social integration {{starting in the}} family home and extending to the neighborhood, company, and nation. In the postwar period, households and <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> were largely fixed, mediated by company society, a standard breadwinner family model and an ascent up an owner-occupied housing ladder. The bursting of the economic bubble two decades ago, and the subsequent ‘lost decade’, disrupted established flows into employment, family life, and owner-occupation. We examine recent restructuring of <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> around the home which has become characteristic of social changes and a medium of individualization. The home, once ingrained with notions of the eternal Japanese family, has become a conduit of atomization for younger generations who have experienced radical shifts in social and economic conditions. Since the 1990 s numbers of single-only and couple-only households have ballooned while marriage and fertility rates have declined. Although homeownership norms have persisted, new patterns of renting and single living in the city, or remaining in the family home as a ‘parasite single’, are increasing. We consider how the reconstitution of ‘home’ under more insecure housing and employment conditions is embedded with the reshaping of <b>life</b> <b>courses,</b> housing pathways, and patterns of urban space and living. ...|$|R

BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} associations between work-family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> and biomarkers of inflammation and stress in mid-life among British men and women. Gender differences in these associations were also explored. METHODS: A novel statistical method-multi-channel sequence analysis-defined work-family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> between the ages of 16 and 42 years, combining annual information on work, partnership and parenthood. Associations between work-family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> and inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor] and cortisol at age 44 / 45 years were tested using multivariate linear regression using multiply-imputed data on almost 6500 participants from the National Child Development Study 1958 British birth cohort. RESULTS: Compared with those who combined strong ties to paid work with later transitions to stable family lives ('Work, later family' group), 'Teen parents' had higher CRP [40. 6 % higher, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 5. 6, 87. 0] and fibrinogen (7. 8 % higher, 95 % CI: 2. 3, 13. 5) levels, and homemakers ('No paid work, early family') had raised fibrinogen levels (4. 7 % higher, 95 % CI: 0. 7, 9. 0), independent of childhood health and socioeconomic position, adult socioeconomic position, health behaviours and body mass index (BMI). Those who combined later transitions to stable family ties with a career break for childrearing had higher post-waking cortisol than the 'Work, later family' group; however, no associations were seen for other work-family types, therefore suggesting a null finding with cortisol. No statistically significant gender interactions in associations between work-family types and inflammatory or cortisol outcomes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Work-family <b>life</b> <b>courses</b> characterised by early parenthood or weak work ties were associated with a raised risk profile in relation to chronic inflammation...|$|R
