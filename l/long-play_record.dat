But there is one among these songs that is a standout and right in keeping with the story on the record.

40|$|Over {{the past}} {{third of a}} century, {{there has been a}} {{revolution}} in the way that health-care providers and patients make most medical decisions. Paternalism has slowly gone the way of the <b>long-play</b> <b>record,</b> and in its place has emerged a consent process in which the patient is a more fully informed and active participant. This process takes time however, and for the busy health-care provider there is often the temptation to hand the patient a consent form to sign. It is important to realize that signing a consent form does not constitute informed consent. True informed consent is a process, and, as such, it requires that the health-care provider enter into a discussion that ultimately leads to the patient understanding of their options, and the risks and benefits of the alternative courses of action. The purpose of this article was to describe, in some detail, the consent process in practical clinical terms, and to note when and how it should be obtained. (CHEST 2007; 131 : 563 – 568) Key words: decision making; ethics; informed consent J ust as medicine has evolved over the past 200 years into a sophisticated profession that can often alleviate symptoms and cure disease, so also has the physician-patient relationship evolved from one o...|$|E

[...] "Basically, the whole idea - everything about Cinematic Sunrise - is just happy and fun.

5000|$|The players {{themselves}} were manufactured by CBS Electronics. According {{to the official}} Chrysler press release of September 12, 1955, [...] "Highway Hi-Fi plays through {{the speaker of the}} car radio and uses the radio's amplifier system. The turntable for playing records, built for Chrysler by CBS-Columbia, is located in a shock-proof case mounted just below the center of the instrument panel. A tone arm, including sapphire stylus and ceramic pick up, plus storage space for six <b>long-play</b> <b>records</b> make up the unit." [...] A button controlled whether you listened to the radio or the records. A proprietary 0.25-mil (i.e., 0.00025" [...] or a quarter of a [...] "thou") stylus was used with an unusually high stylus pressure of two grams to prevent skipping or skating despite normal car vibrations.|$|R

5000|$|After the war Franz, in {{co-operation}} {{with the}} ‘Rundfunktechnisches Institut’, (‘Broadcasting Technique Institute’) directed by Dr. Ing. Walter Kuhl, designed the ‘927 Large Studio turntable'. Introduced in 1951, the 927 {{is an impressive}} machine, outstanding in size (67 cm wide, 52 cm deep and 21.5 cm high) and performance. Its enormous main platter (44 cm) was necessary to play 16” acetate records and it was driven by a very large electric motor through a sturdy idler-wheel system. Additionally it could play the 33 rpm 12” <b>Long-Playing</b> <b>records</b> and 7” 45 rpm (RCA-standard) discs. The Danish firm Ortofon provided the tonearm for the 927 (‘RF-297’) and the first magnetic pickup officially installed by EMT on their turntables. A stroboscope engraved around the acrylic outer platter allowed the fine tuning of the 927’s speed and its quick-start arrangement allowed a remarkably short starting time of less than 500 milliseconds at 33rpm, an astounding feat at the time. The 927 was built in different versions, the ‘927A’, with an optical indicator {{of the position of}} the stylus on the grooves, the ‘927D’, a special reference version built with special care and very close tolerances for laboratory use, while the ‘927F’ could accommodate a second tonearm behind the platter, and ‘927st’ stereo version.|$|R
50|$|Gaisberg refused {{offers of}} a {{directorship}} at HMV, preferring {{to remain a}} link between the artists and the company. At age 66, in 1939, he retired but continued on as a consultant at EMI, exerting considerable influence on the recording industry. In the late 1940s he argued in favour of <b>long-play</b> (LP) <b>records,</b> introduced by Columbia Records in 1948, and stereophonic recording, introduced in 1958 after his death. One of his last projects, in the early 1930s, was to conceive, and supervise the construction of, a major facility for classical recording, Abbey Road Studios.|$|R
5000|$|Linn Products Limited {{was started}} by Tiefenbrun in the city's Castlemilk {{district}} near Linn Park in 1972 to manufacture a hi-fi turntable, developed from his personal interest in music reproduction, based on contemporary models. His approach was to try getting more information off the <b>long-play</b> gramophone <b>record</b> (otherwise known as the LP), and making the turntable immune to audio feedback [...] - [...] he successfully discovered a marketing story {{very different from the}} prevalent view in the hi-fi industry at that time. The end product was the Linn Sondek LP12, which remained an industry benchmark for at least three decades.|$|R
5000|$|Dean Martin Sings is {{the first}} studio album by Italian-American singer Dean Martin, {{released}} in 1953. It {{is the first}} <b>long-play</b> 10-inch album <b>recorded</b> by Martin for Capitol Records during two sessions recorded {{on the evening of}} November 20, 1952. The first session was recorded between 5 and 8 PM and it produced five songs featuring string arrangements. [...] "There's My Lover" [...] was recorded but not released. After a ninety-minute break, Martin was joined by a brass arrangement to record the remaining four songs. Seven of the eight songs on this album appeared in the Martin & Lewis film, The Stooge. Two years later, the songs from this 10-inch album would be combined with four newly popular songs recorded between 1951 and 1953 to create a full-length 12-inch album. The 2005 Collectors' Choice reissue added four bonus songs recorded between 1949 and 1953 and was released with alternative cover artwork.|$|R
40|$|The {{music of}} the American minimalist composers-above all, Steve Reich and Philip Glass-continues to excite an {{increasingly}} diverse, international public. DJs have hammered out artful and groovy remixes; online mavens have banded together in chat groups; and the advertising industry has licensed Glass's music and commissioned Reich knock-offs as parts of campaigns for cars, cereal, soft drinks, and many other products. The composers have found success in more conventional venues as well. Last fall, Reich won the Edward MacDowell Medal, while Glass saw the premieres of his eighth symphony and his twenty-first opera. This unusual assortment of venues and events connected with minimal music makes it-perhaps {{more than any other}} twentieth- or twenty-first- century Western classical repertoire-admirably suited to a sustained examination of its wider cultural contexts. For the most part, however, few have ever attempted such a study. Most scholarly works on minimalism resolutely privilege its formalism and have used sophisticated music-analytical tools to explicate the music's structure (among many fine examples, see Cohn 1993); only recently have scholars undertaken broader, culturally grounded inquiries (Grimshaw 2002). Thus, Robert Fink's Repeating Ourselves, a major work of such cultural criticism, is long overdue. Fink, an associate professor of music at UCLA, has a lively mind that has led his teaching and scholarship in a variety of directions, from the dizzying array of genres (and subgenres) of electronic dance music to Freudian readings of Brahms and Schoenberg. In all his work, he profitably reads music against the grain to disclose unexpected cultural connections and resonances; his best work discusses popular and classical musics {{in such a way that}} he honors both without reinscribing traditional (and sometimes problematic) methods of determining their value. Fink situates American (and some European) minimal music in anumber of concurrent cultural activities. In chapter I, "Do It ('til You're Satisfied) : Repetitive Musics and Recombinant Desires;' he counterpoises Reich's Music for Eighteen Musicians with Donna Summer's "Love to Love You, Baby" (both from 1976) to explore the multivalent and erotically charged teleology of minimalism and disco. Chapter 2, "'A Colorful Installment in the Twentieth-Century Drama of Consumer Subjectivity': Minimalism and the Phenomenology of Consumer Desire;' examines the culture of repetitive advertising in the 1960 s, theorizes it (with the help of Jean Baudrillard's ideas of postmodernity), and briefly considers how several compositions by Reich and Glass might be heard to echo it. Fink continues this inquiry in chapter 3, "The Media Sublime: Minimalism, Advertising, and Television;' with more sustained analyses of Reich's Eight Lines (1979), Terry Riley's In C (1964), Louis Andriessen's Hoketus (1977), and "The Grid," from Glass's score for Godfrey Reggio's film Koyaanisqatsi (1982). Chapter 4, '''A Pox on Manfredini'; The <b>Long-Playing</b> <b>Record,</b> the Baroque Revival, and the Birth of Ambient Music," considers the repetitive, mood-regulating therapy offered by automatic record changers loaded up with mediocre performances of Vivaldi, Telemann, and other composers of Baroque Tafelmusik. Finally, Fink turns to the intersections of minimalism and Suzuki violin instruction in America in chapter 5, '''I Did This Exercise 100, 000 Times': Zen, Minimalism, and the Suzuki Method;' and ultimately concludes that repetitive musical and social activities facilitated the minimalist process-works of the mid- and later 1960 s...|$|R
