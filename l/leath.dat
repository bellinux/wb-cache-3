It uses the idea of scholarly engagement, which emphasizes moving theory to practice {{in collaboration with the}} communities who have potential to benefit. This project was conducted in classrooms of the Iowa State University 4 U Promise partnering elementary schools, King and Moulton. Drawing on research about engagement and academic success among English Language Learners (ELLs) and working with teachers, several identified strategies were tested. Over a semester, 5 hours a week was spent engaging ELLs in small groups and individual work. Field notes were documented detailing the activities and observations of the strategies’ effectiveness in promoting engagement in literacy acquisition. Results from the study are summarized as follows: engagement and academic success of ELLs is impacted by 1) family mobility; 2) positive relationships with individual students; and 3) the relevance to the learner of classroom activities. This experience facilitated an increased comprehension of the application of theory to practice, inform the work of ISU education researchers in these schools, and ultimately a better teacher of ELLs...|$|R

500|$|In {{the last}} third of the twelfth century, Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster (died 1171) was deposed and driven from Ireland by his rivals. He {{subsequently}} enlisted the aid of English mercenaries and launched an invasion of Ireland. In 1170, the combined forces of Diarmait and Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke (died 1176) conquered Dublin. The following year, the aforesaid Ruaidrí, who was then the reigning High King of Ireland and King of Connacht, along with Lorcán Ua Tuathail, Archbishop of Dublin (died 1180), appealed to Guðrøðr for military assistance from the Isles. Although Ruaidrí besieged the town by land, whilst Guðrøðr blockaded it by sea, Dublin remained firmly in English hands. Within the year, Henry II, King of England (died 1189) arrived in Ireland and consolidated English control. One of the few provincial kings who refused to submit to Henry was Ruaidrí himself; and in 1173 or 1174, he assembled a massive host from northern Ireland in campaign to bring a halt to the English colonisation of Mide. According to the twelfththirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande, one of the numerous rulers who rallied to Ruaidrí's cause was Mac Scelling himself. This source further states that Ruaidrí enlisted support not only support from <b>Leath</b> Cuinna reference to northern Irelandbut also from [...] "les Norreys" [...] and [...] "les Norreis"two terms that may refer to Norsemen. La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande, therefore, appears to indicate that Ruaidrí indeed received support from the Hebrides.|$|E

According to some historical accounts of this incident, having been advised that high notes sung in her natural soprano might shatter the fragile vacuum tubes of her carbon microphone's amplifier, De <b>Leath</b> switched to a deep contralto and in the process invented [...] "crooning", which became the dominant pop vocal styling for the next three decades.|$|E
