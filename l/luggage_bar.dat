50|$|Following {{the success}} of their go-karts, Rupp began {{manufacturing}} mini bikes beginning in 1962 until the mid 1970s. Models included the Dart Cycle, Continental, Roadster, Scrambler, Hustler, Chopper, Black Widow, Enduro, Roadster 2, Swinger, Sprint, Digger, Goat, Ram, TT-500, XL-500, XL-350 and others. Rupp minibikes were made in a variety of styles with various features, including varying engine sizes, lighting kits and color options. Rupp offered upgrades to their bikes as well, including speedometers, <b>luggage</b> racks, lift <b>bars,</b> horns, mud flaps and crash bars.|$|R
2500|$|Mods also treated scooters as {{a fashion}} accessory. Italian scooters were {{preferred}} {{due to their}} clean-lined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome, with sale driven by close associations between dealerships and clubs, such as the Ace of Herts. For young mods, Italian scooters were the [...] "embodiment of continental style {{and a way to}} escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing". Mods customised their scooters by painting them in [...] "two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [...] with <b>luggage</b> racks, crash <b>bars,</b> and scores of mirrors and fog lights". Some mods added four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. They often put their names on the small windscreen. They sometimes took their engine side panels and front bumpers to electroplating shops to get them covered in highly reflective chrome.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s mod subculture, many British youth used motorscooters for transportation, usually Vespas or Lambrettas. Scooters had {{provided}} inexpensive transportation for decades before {{the development of}} the mod subculture, but the mods stood out {{in the way that they}} treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the Ace of Herts. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome.

5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or <b>luggage,</b> she was <b>barred</b> from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|R
2500|$|Differences {{from the}} earlier Pioneer IIIs {{included}} a single arm Faiveley pantograph, {{a state of the}} art propulsion system that made use of solid state phase angle controllers coupled to mercury arc ignitron rectifiers and higher powered motors. [...] Like the Pioneer IIIs before them, the Silverliners offered their riders air cushion suspension, air conditioning, electric train heat and a nearly silent ride. [...] With 150hp more than the Pioneer III cars (550hp total) the Silverliners could achieve a 1.7mph/s acceleration rate which was quite higher than the older MP54s and multi-function couplers and disc brakes further improved performance. [...] The 38 PRR cars were numbered in two series, 201-219 and 251-269 and given PRR classification MP85B, while the 17 Reading cars were numbered 9001-9017 and given Reading classification REB-13. [...] There were also minor differences between the two sets of vehicles with the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead <b>luggage</b> rack, a <b>bar</b> pilot, a metal framed engineer's window and cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a cowcatcher and twin overhead luggage racks. [...] The first set of PRR cars, #201-216, were also equipped with bathrooms in place of a 3-person bench seat in the 'F' end of the car to enable the cars use on longer runs to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or New York City.|$|R
5000|$|Despite both Reading and PRR cars {{being paid}} for {{in part by the}} PSIC, each {{railroad}} was allowed to put their own stamp on the design. These differences included the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead <b>luggage</b> rack, a <b>bar</b> pilot, a metal-framed engineer's window and position-light cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a cowcatcher, twin overhead luggage racks, and color light (though PRR-compatible) cab signals; the latter were removed after the RDG discontinued its 1928 cab signal installation on the Bethlehem Branch between Jenkintown and Lansdale in 1967, and 9001-9017 would have to be re-equipped with cab signal equipment in 1983-84 in preparation for operation through the Center City Commuter Connection and former PRR lines. The first group of PRR cars (201-219) were intended by be used on longer distance runs to places like Harrisburg, PA and New York City and were equipped with a bathroom on the [...] "F" [...] end to facilitate this. The second set of PRR cars, along with all of the Reading cars, were not equipped with comfort facilities, substituting a 3-person bench seat is its place. While all of the Silverliner cars were delivered with disc brakes, the PRR disliked this feature as it required trains to be placed over a drop pit for routine brake work, and all of their 38 cars were converted to conventional tread brakes by 1968. [...] The Reading cars were not converted to tread braking until rebuilding in the SEPTA era in 1989. In addition to the disc brakes, all classes of Budd Silverliner were delivered with an early multi-function coupler design that consisted of an AAR [...] "tightlock" [...] knuckle coupler mounted above a separate automatic coupler for air and electrical connections. This design allowed the new MU cars to be attached (in emergencies or planned shop moves) for towing behind locomotives, conventional passenger and heavyweight MU cars, or in freight trains; the outer ends of the stepboxes were lettered with detailed instructions to train crews for doing so. However, the newer fleet of 232 Silverliner IVs were delivered with Budd's new [...] "pin and cup" [...] coupler and both the Silverliner II and III fleets were modified to both couple to and MU with the IVs, as opposed to the older cars the IVs were replacing. When this change was carried out the Penn Central fitted its cars with a welded bar pilot to protect the leading wheels from debris impact.|$|R
