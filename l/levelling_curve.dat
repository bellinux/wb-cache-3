Then f has finitely many critical <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> (<b>level</b> <b>curves</b> containing critical points of f) in the disk, and the non-critical <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> interpolate smoothly between the critical <b>level</b> <b>curves.</b> Thus, to understand the geometry of all the <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f, one needs only understand the finitely many critical <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f. In this paper, we show that in fact such a function f is determined not just geometrically but conformally by the configuration of critical <b>level</b> <b>curves.</b> That is, if f_ 1 and f_ 2 have the same configuration of critical <b>level</b> <b>curves,</b> {{then there is a}} conformal map ϕ such that f_ 1 ≡ f_ 2 ∘ϕ.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the bounded <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of a meromorphic {{function}} f with domain G such that each component of ∂G consists of a <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> of f. (A primary example of such a function being a ratio of finite Blaschke products of different degrees, with domain D.) We will first prove several facts about a single bounded <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> of a f in isolation from the other <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f. We will then study how the <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f lie with respect to each other. It is natural to expect that the sets {z:|f(z) |=ϵ} vary continuously as ϵ varies. We will make this notion explicit, and use this continuity to prove several results about the bounded <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f. It is well known that if z_ 0 is a zero or a pole of f, then f is conformally equivalent to the function zz^k (for some k∈Z) in a neighborhood of z_ 0. We generalize this fact by finding a natural decomposition of G into finitely many sub-regions (also bounded by <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> of f), on each of which f is conformally equivalent to zz^k (for some k∈Z). Also included is a new proof, using <b>level</b> <b>curves,</b> of the Gauss [...] Lucas theorem that the critical points of a polynomial are contained in the convex hull of the polynomial's zeros.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{accuracy}} of optical character recognition (OCR), optical scanners may be characterized on-the-fly, without calibration images, so the OCR software can model and predict certain deformations due to the scanning process. To do this, bilevel (black and white) document pages are segmented, individual characters are isolated, and corners are extracted from the characters and measured. From these measurements, scanner characterization parameters may be found. The existing subsystem that finds these parameters from corner measurements requires a prohibitive {{amount of time to}} execute. Two primary sources of resource consumption are identified and detailed. The first source is the extraction of <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> from surfaces unique to each corner angle measurement ø. In general, there is no closed mathematical form for the surface, so simulation is used. The simulation algorithm is of sufficiently-high polynomial complexity to render surface generation impractical for use on-the-fly. Two algorithms that find <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> from a set S of pre-generated surfaces are detailed. One method approximates the actual surface to be used for <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> extraction from two nearby surfaces from S. The other modifies corner measurements and uses existing surfaces in S to find <b>level</b> <b>curves.</b> The second source is the finding of intersections between <b>level</b> <b>curves.</b> The existing subsystem naively performs an exhaustive search. Two alternatives exploit spatial locality to find the intersections faster. One algorithm partitions space and limits the scope of its search to a given partition. The other partitions <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> and finds bounding boxes that entirely contain those portions of <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> constituting the partitions. Only those portions of the <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> belonging to overlapping bounding boxes are checked for intersection. Two enhancements to the intersection-finding algorithms are given. One enhancement rotates the <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> to align with the partition boundaries, making the partitioning more efficient. The other shortens the lengths of the <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> by eliminating easily-identified, large portions of curves where intersection is impossible. Since the search for intersections is (partly) dependent on the lengths of the <b>level</b> <b>curves,</b> this improves execution time. The speedups realized from the algorithms detailed in this thesis are presented. Overall, about 4 orders of magnitude speedup were achieved. The algorithms that find <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> from surfaces employ approximations, so a comparison with prior results using the existing subsystem is also presented. Deviation ranged from 2. 5 % to 3. 5 %, depending on the algorithm used...|$|R

This paper proposes an easy {{approach}} to obtaining 3 D surface models in parametric CAD software products from random sets of points, {{based on the}} analogy of <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> from geodesic disciplines.

5000|$|An earlier {{approach}} to corner detection is to detect points where the curvature of <b>level</b> <b>curves</b> and the gradient magnitude are simultaneously high. A differential way to detect such points is by computing the rescaled <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> curvature (the {{product of the}} <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> curvature and the gradient magnitude raised {{to the power of}} three)and to detect positive maxima and negative minima of this differential expression at some scale [...] in the scale space representation [...] of the original image. A main problem when computing the rescaled <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> curvature entity at a single scale however, is that it may be sensitive to noise and to the choice of the scale level. A better method is to compute the -normalized rescaled <b>level</b> <b>curve</b> curvaturewith [...] and to detect signed scale-space extrema of this expression, that are points and scales that are positive maxima and negative minima with respect to both space and scalein combination with a complementary localization step to handle the increase in localization error at coarser scales. In this way, larger scale values will be associated with rounded corners of large spatial extent while smaller scale values will be associated with sharp corners with small spatial extent. This approach is the first corner detector with automatic scale selection (prior to the [...] "Harris-Laplace operator" [...] above) and has been used for tracking corners under large scale variations in the image domain and for matching corner responses to edges to compute structural image features for geon-based object recognition.|$|R
