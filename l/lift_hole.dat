40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructures made {{of glass}} {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP), often abbreviated GRP cover, are used to protect subsea equipment in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These structures need to be lifted during fabrication, transportation and during the installation. The present work investigates the lifting capacity of the GRP covers. The aim is to achieve a more accurate analytical estimate of the lifting capacity, with a desire to replace the simplified hand calculations used today. In order to investigate the lifting capacity, a lifting point (reinforced <b>lifting</b> <b>holes</b> made of GRP) is studied with both finite element analysis and experimental tests in a hydraulic tensile bench. Three different test setups, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 are investigated. Case 1 is a representation of a lift through the splash zone during installation, where the GRP cover is in an upright vertical position. Case 2 is an approximation of a horizontal lift with the lifting point located on top of the cover, causing the lifting point to encounter out-of-plane loads. Case 3 is a representation of a horizontal four-point lift, with the lifting point placed on the side walls. The experimental tests were performed in collaboration with Highcomp AS at Westcon Løfteteknikk in Haugesund. The finite element analysis represents the test setup in the hydraulic tensile bench in order to achieve comparable data. Finite element analysis can reduce cost and time compared with physical experiments. For Case 1, with in-plane loads representing the lifting through the splash zone, the results achieved were within a 2 % error margin. For the out-of-plane situation (Case 2) with solid elements, the results were within a 20 % error margin. The results from the in-plane and out-of-plane scenarios were used in a capacity evaluation to create a graph which represents all results and takes into account the out-of-plane angle from the lifting slings. This graph is easy to use in design and provides good results. Based on the comparison of the results, it was concluded that the Puck criterion with gradual degradation provides the most accurate estimate for the capacity and that use of this criterion can replace simplified hand calculation and reduce the number of physical experiments in the future. Based on these findings, an improvement study was conducted for a 30 mm laminate with Puck criterion and gradual degradation with a new lay-up consisting of fibers at [0, 90, + 45, - 45] degrees, compared to the one used today [0, 90]. The results of the new study showed an increase of over 28 % for the capacity in Case 1 and an increase of over 16 % compared with Case 2. These are interesting results, leading to the conclusion that by introducing the fiber directions + 45 degrees, one can enhance the capacity of the material by about 20 %, and it is easy and efficient to implement in a new design of the lifting point used in GRP covers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} all N= 2 supersymmetric IIB supergravity backgrounds with non-vanishing five-form flux. The Killing spinors have stability subgroups Spin(7) ⋉R 8, SU(4) ⋉R 8 and G 2. In the SU(4) ⋉R 8 case, {{two different}} types of geometry arise depending on whether the Killing spinors are generic or pure. In both cases, the backgrounds admit a null Killing vector field which leaves invariant the SU(4) ⋉R 8 structure, and an almost complex structure in the directions transverse to the lightcone. In the generic case, the twist of the vector field is trivial but the almost complex structure is non-integrable, while in the pure case the twist is non-trivial but the almost complex structure is integrable and associated with a relatively balanced Hermitian structure. The G 2 backgrounds admit a time-like Killing vector field and two spacelike closed one-forms, and the seven directions transverse to these admit a co-symplectic G 2 structure.

30|$|For the PV result {{shown in}} Fig.  10 {{before and after}} heating, the PV of BWBM before heating was 7.4 cP and 6.5 cP for HWBM. PV {{reflects}} {{the magnitude of the}} friction between the mass points in the fluid under laminar condition when the equilibrium of breakage and recovery of the structure in the fluid is reached (Caenn et al. 2017). It is a property that controls the degree of shear-stress to shear-rate. Its main function in drilling mud is to provide information relating to a connection between the pumping rate and pump power requirement in a given well configuration. The PV value of BWBM before thermal aging was higher than that of HWBM, which {{may be due to the}} deflocculating characteristics of HLE and the presence of bentonite clay in BWBM. When bentonite clay solid gets in contact with water, it swells owing to its water absorption property, and this in turn increases its viscous nature. In addition, the PV and GS properties of bentonite muds system are achieved by clay-particle-to-clay-particle interactions. Clay particles in the water phase are attracted to each other and build up a structure that produces viscosity (Oseh et al. 2018). This is the reason for the higher value of PV in BWBM than that of HWBM. Lower volumes of drilling cuttings and solids offer faster penetration rate due to less resistance to fluid flow beneath the bit. Nonetheless, the PV should not be too low so that the drilled cuttings and other solids <b>lifting</b> from the <b>hole</b> to the surface will be possible (Gbadamosi et al. 2018 b; Piroozian et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|The term "rotary percussive auto-gopher" denotes a {{proposed}} {{addition to a}} family of apparatuses, based on ultrasonic/ sonic drill corers (USDCs), that have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. These apparatuses have been designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. In {{the case of the}} rotary percussive autogopher, the emphasis would be on developing an apparatus capable of penetrating to, and acquiring samples at, depths that could otherwise be reached only by use of much longer, heavier, conventional drilling-and-sampling apparatuses. To recapitulate from the prior articles about USDCs: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power jackhammer in which a piezoelectrically driven actuator generates ultrasonic vibrations and is coupled to a tool bit through a free mass. The bouncing of the free mass between the actuator horn and the drill bit converts the actuator ultrasonic vibrations into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action {{at the tip of the}} tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that the size of the axial force needed to make the tool bit advance into soil, rock, or another material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary rotary drilling, ordinary hammering, or ordinary steady pushing. The predecessor of the rotary percussive auto-gopher is an apparatus, now denoted an ultrasonic/sonic gopher and previously denoted an ultrasonic gopher, described in "Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanism for Drilling and Coring" (NPO- 30291), NASA Tech Briefs Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. The ultrasonic/sonic gopher is intended for use mainly in acquiring cores. The name of the apparatus reflects the fact that, like a gopher, it periodically stops advancing at the end of the hole to bring excavated material (in this case, a core sample) to the surface, then re-enters the hole to resume the advance of the end of the hole. By use of a cable suspended from a reel on the surface, the gopher is <b>lifted</b> from the <b>hole</b> to remove a core sample, then lowered into the hole to resume the advance and acquire the next core sample...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Aerodynamic analysis is an important area of survivability studies. There is {{a desire to be}} able to predict the aerodynamic effects of a given damage scenario on an aircraft wing with minimal wind tunnel testing or computational simulations. Due to the limited nature of previous studies, this has not generally been possible. The original contribution of this thesis is a predictive technique developed to estimate the aerodynamic effects of a simulated battle damage hole on an aircraft wing, resulting from a range of attack directions. This technique was successfully validated against experimental data. Testing under two-dimensional conditions was undertaken on a NASA LS(1) - 0417 MOD aerofoil at a Reynolds number of 500, 000. This project simulates the effect of attack direction by varying the offset between upper and lower surface damage holes in both chordwise and spanwise directions. Damage was modelled using circular <b>holes.</b> <b>Lift,</b> drag and pitching moment coefficients were measured and supplemented with surface flow visualisation and surface pressure measurements. Coefficient increments, defined as the difference between the damage cases and a datum undamaged case were used to quantify the effects of the damage, with the performance qualified in terms of weak and strong jets. Weak jets were found to have little effect on the flow and aerodynamic properties, while strong jets caused significant disruption. The effects increased in magnitude with hole size, incidence and proximity of the upper surface hole to the pressure peak. Spanwise offset on the holes had little effect on the jet strength but introduced asymmetry into the surface flow. This effect was found to be due to the behaviour of the flow within the cavity. Three-dimensional testing was undertaken at a Reynolds number of 1, 000, 000 on a half wing model in order to investigate any changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the damage when applied to a more representative aircraft wing. The higher Reynolds number exploited the larger wind tunnel working section and provided a value more representative of typical unmanned aerial vehicles. As the damage was moved towards the tip its effects were lessened and the transition from weak jet to strong jet delayed. Spanwise pressure variation from the tip also introduced asymmetry into the jet s surface flow features. Plotting coefficient increments for all attack directions against the pressure coefficient difference between upper and lower surfaces from an undamaged wing, across the equivalent damage hole region highlighted significant trends, which were used as the basis of a predictive technique for a range of hole sizes and attack directions. The validity of the technique was assessed by predicting a previously untested damage case and comparing it against subsequent wind tunnel tests. The results from this validation proved encouraging...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{results from}} studies on (In) GaN quantum dots (QDs) are presented, {{including}} {{investigations of the}} structural, optical and electronic properties. The experimental studies were performed on GaN and InGaN QDs grown by molecular beam epitaxy, {{taking advantage of the}} Stranki-Krastanov growth mode for the GaN QD samples and the composition segregation for the InGaN QD samples. Optical spectroscopy of the (In) GaN QDs was performed with a combination of different experimental techniques, e. g. stationary microphotoluminescence (μPL) and timeresolved μPL. The μPL spectroscopy is suitable for studies of single QDs due to the wellfocused excitation laser spot, and it typically does not require any special sample preparation. The powerful combination of power and polarization dependences was used to distinguish the exciton and the biexciton emissions from other emission lines in the recorded spectra. The QDs could be observed with random in-plane anisotropy, as determined by the strong linear polarization for single QDs but with different angular orientation from dot to dot. Additionally, these experimental results are in good agreement with the computational results revealing a similar degree of polarization for the exciton and the biexciton emissions. Further, the theory predicts that the discrepancy of the polarization degree is larger between the positive and negative trions in comparison with the exciton and the biexciton. Based on this result, polarization resolved spectroscopy is proposed as a simple tool for the identification of trions and their charge states. The fine-structure splitting (FSS) and the biexciton binding energy (Ebxx) are essential QD parameters of relevance for the possible generation of quantum entangled photon pairs in a cascade recombination of the biexciton. In general, the Coulomb interaction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged <b>hole</b> <b>lifts</b> the fourfold degeneracy of the electron and hole pair ground state, forming a set of zero-dimensional exciton states of unequal energies. This Coulomb-induced splitting, referred to as the FSS, results in an electronic fine structure, which is strongly dependent on the symmetry of the exciton wave function. The FSS was in this work resolved and investigated for excitons in InGaN QDs, using polarization-sensitive μPL spectroscopy employed on the cleaved-edge of the samples. As expected, the FSS is found to exhibit identical magnitudes, but with reversed sign for the exciton and the biexciton. For quantum information applications, a vanishing FSS is required, since otherwise the emissions of the polarization-entangled photon pairs in the cascade biexciton recombination will be prohibited. The biexcitons are found to exhibit both positive and negative binding energies for the investigated QDs. Since a negative binding energy indicates a repulsive Coulomb interaction, such biexcitons (or exciton complexes) cannot exist in structures of higher dimensionality. On the other hand, a biexciton with a negative binding energy can be found in QDs, since the exciton complexes still remain bound due to their three dimensional confinement. Moreover, the biexciton binding energy depends on the dot size, which implies that a careful size control of dots could enable manipulation of the biexciton binding energy. A large Ebxx value enables better and cheaper spectral filtering, in order to purify the single photon emission, while a proposed time reordering scheme relies on zero Ebxx for the generation of entangled photons. The dynamics of the exciton and the biexciton emissions from InGaN QD were measured by means of time-resolved μPL. The lifetimes of the exciton related emissions are demonstrated to depend on the dot size. Both the exciton and the biexciton emissions reveal mono-exponential decays, with a biexciton lifetime, which is about two times shorter than the exciton lifetime. This implies that the QD is small, with a size comparable to the exciton Bohr radius. The photon generation rates can be manipulated by controlling the QDs size, which in turn can be utilized for generation of single- and entangled-photons on demand, with a potential for applications in e. g. quantum information. The polarization of the emitted single photons can be manipulated by using a polarizer, but to the prize of photon loss and reduced emission intensity. Alternative methods to control the polarization of the emission light are a manipulation of the dot symmetry statically by its shape or dynamically by an externally applied electric field. Predictions based on performed calculations show that in materials with a small spin-orbit split-off energy (ΔSO), like the III-nitride materials, the polarization degree of the emission is more sensitive to dot asymmetry than in materials with a large value for ΔSO, e. g. the III-arsenide materials. Moreover, for an electric field applied in the 1 ͞ 10 and the 11 ͞ 2 directions of the zinc-blende lens-shaped QDs grown on the (111) plane, the polarization degree of InN QDs is found to be significantly more, by a factor of ~ 50 times, sensitive to the electric field than for GaN QDs. This work demonstrates that especially the InN based QD, are suitable for manipulation of the polarization by the direct control of the dot symmetry or by externally applied electric fields...|$|R
