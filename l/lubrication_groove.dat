5000|$|All lead wadcutters require proper {{lubrication}} {{to prevent}} leading of rifling and forcing cones {{when used in}} firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 <b>lubrication</b> <b>grooves,</b> with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both [...]38 Special and [...]357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both [...]44 Special and [...]44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths {{may need to be}} set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.|$|R
5000|$|Smith & Wesson {{did so by}} {{reducing}} {{the diameter of the}} [...]44 bullet to [...]430 and adding <b>lubrication</b> <b>grooves</b> to its base. This evolutionary improvement became an archetype, influencing future cartridge designs. With improved firearm metallurgy available, Smith & Wesson increased the bullet weight of the new cartridge to 246 grains while retaining a heavy 23 grain black-powder propellant charge which almost equalled that of the [...]44 American and produced a muzzle velocity of roughly 750 ft/s. As a result of these changes, the [...]44 Russian generated a much higher chamber pressure of 12,000 copper units of pressure (CUP) compared to the older [...]44 American round which generated only 6-8,000 CUP. To prevent the new high-pressure ammunition from being fired in [...]44 American revolvers with disastrous results, the overall cartridge case length was increased by [...]02 in to 0.970 in. In addition, the cylinder design of the No. 3 revolver had to be changed from the straight bored [...]44 American configuration to a stepped arrangement which was [...]457 in {{at the rear of the}} cylinder to accept the case, and narrower from the case shoulder forward to give a tight fit for the smaller bore [...]44 Russian bullet.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} journal bearings of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the journal bearings and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial clearance, journal bearing diameter and journal bearing length) on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection of the <b>lubrication</b> system <b>groove</b> suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal bearing length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal bearing diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these journal bearings, and that the <b>lubrication</b> system <b>grooves</b> should be circumferential.

40|$|AbstractThe rising {{requirements}} in cutting operations for higher performance and higher efficiency respecting also environmental phenomena are influencing {{the use of}} different coolants and flushing conditions. In machining difficult-to-cut materials, in particular high-temperature materials, conventional emulsion cooling is unsuitable due to the insufficient cooling effect and the energy and cost intensive equipment required. For this reason new cooling and lubricating strategies have to be developed and investigated. Using hybrid processes, mainly by superposition of various cooling strategies, offers the potential to extend the existing technological process limits of conventional cutting processes. The paper introduces theoretical, experimental and simulation results with various innovative cooling strategies, such as high-pressure cooling, cryogenic cooling and aerosol dry <b>lubrication</b> in <b>grooving,</b> turning and drilling and derives the appropriate field of application for each flushing strategy...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} {{an effort to}} achieve greater understanding on the lubrication of engine journal bearings and develop a model {{which can be used}} in future work for the optimization of load carrying capacity and minimization of frictional power loss. In a first step a model is presented which include dynamic loading, cavitation, non-Newtonian <b>lubrication</b> and <b>groove</b> geometry. The model is incorporated in a commercial multiphysics software (COMSOL). Cavitation and non-Newtonian lubrication are complex phenomena which require model simplifications. Cavitation model simplification has been chosen after evaluation of solutions found in literature while a new model one has been proposed for non-Newtonian lubrication. The simulation model for journal bearings has then been used to analyze bearing performance under geometrical and oil parameters variation. Main results include that typical oil definition with viscosity values at high and low shear rates is insufficient and that higher eccentricity in operating conditions helps bearing stability against perturbations.
