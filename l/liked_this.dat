Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he <b>liked.</b> <b>This</b> meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Vortigaunts {{were planned}} to begin Half-Life as enemy non-player characters, which the player {{has to win}} over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved {{impractical}} and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries. The plan re-emerged for Half-Life 2, in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2 were originally going to be fully integrated in City 17 alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game {{taking place in the}} countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to hint at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game. Midway through Half-Life 2, the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers <b>liked</b> <b>this</b> idea, {{but it was too late}} in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in Episode Two. The concept was later showcased in an Episode Two trailer shown at the Games Convention in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Cranmer {{assigned}} Ridley {{to perform}} the consecration, and Ridley refused {{to do anything but}} follow the form of the ordinal as it had been prescribed by Parliament. Ridley, it seems likely, had some particular objection to Hooper. It has been suggested that Henrician exiles like Hooper, who had experienced some of the more radically reformed churches on the continent, were at odds with English clergy who had accepted and never left the established church. John Henry Primus also notes that on 24 July 1550, the day after receiving instructions for Hooper's unique consecration, the church of the Austin Friars in London had been granted to Jan Laski for use as a Stranger church. This was to be a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees, a church with forms and practices that had taken reforms much further than Ridley would have <b>liked.</b> <b>This</b> development—the use of a London church virtually outside Ridley's jurisdiction—was one that Hooper had had a hand in.|$|E
500|$|The work {{most likely}} to have {{influenced}} Stravinsky's Threni is the Lamentatio Jeremiae prophetae, opus 93, by Ernst Krenek, for 8-part unaccompanied choir, composed in 1942 but only published in 1957 (the year before Threni). Stravinsky himself said that he <b>liked</b> <b>this</b> work, that he had read a treatise by Krenek on twelve-tone counterpoint, and that [...] "Perhaps my own Threni shows contact with [...] Lamentations." [...] Stravinsky's decision to rely on a tactus beat rather than on barlines in the [...] "Querimonia" [...] section is one instance.|$|E

500|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants premiered, Plankton was {{not part}} of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after {{producing}} Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: [...] "We'll probably do another [...] next year," [...] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he [...] "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really <b>liked</b> <b>this</b> character". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.|$|E

It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley, appearing between [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] and [...] "Polythene Pam". McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included [...] "Her Majesty", so he asked for it to be cut. The second engineer, John Kurlander, had been instructed not to throw out anything, so after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave [...] "Her Majesty" [...] off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including [...] "Her Majesty".

500|$|For this game, Dante {{was made}} young, {{consumed}} by hatred and inexperienced {{resulting in a}} fighting style similar to a street brawler rather {{than that of a}} skilled swordsman. As a result of the reboot's theme being [...] "rebellion" [...] most of Dante's actions are based around it. Antoniades stated that Dante is about [...] "being cool and making you feel cool when you're playing it," [...] and, as such, they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added he felt the classic Dante was not appealing anymore and when comparing the new Dante with the title character from Bayonetta he did not see her style to be what he wanted for the reboot. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change it as it is supposed to fit within the game's setting.

500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I ever could have <b>liked</b> <b>this</b> music and yet it seems there was such a time."

500|$|In Richard Krzemien's {{original}} draft, Portal {{was referred}} to as Dilo. Executive producer Maurice Hurley saw Portal as being a sort of guard-dog, but thought that the Ferengi turned the concept into [...] "silliness". Director Richard Colla felt that the episode had problems which were only identified after shooting was completed. Riker's notion of sending Chinese finger traps to the Ferengi vessel {{at the end of the}} episode was a reference to The Original Series episode [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] where Chief Engineer Scott beams over a shipload of tribbles to a Klingon ship. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the cast were unhappy with the episode as they didn't like several aspects of it including the fingercuffs joke and the Ferengi in general. The episode also featured the first occasion that Geordi La Forge gave a report to the bridge from the engineering section. The producers <b>liked</b> <b>this</b> image so much that from season two onwards the character became the Chief Engineer.|$|E
