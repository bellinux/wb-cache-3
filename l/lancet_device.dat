40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{sampling}} and off-site analysis of hemoglobin variants by mass spectrometry is reported. This technique uses a nonporous polyurethane membrane as the collection device and transportation medium of {{a blood sample}} for analysis. The same membrane is then used as the MALDI-TOF MS sample support for mass spectrometric analysis. Minimal invasive sample collection is afforded by collecting less than 1 microL of blood using a common <b>lancet</b> <b>device.</b> MALDI-TOF MS is performed directly on the membrane, after washing off the interfering plasma components, followed {{by the addition of}} matrix. This reduces the time of analysis and prevents sample loss. Enzymatic digestion can be performed directly on the membrane, using in this case trypsin, allowing for further characterization of the sample. The method is much less invasive compared to drawing blood with a syringe. The sample may be transported to the laboratory by regular mail, and thus the method can serve remote locations. We demonstrate the procedure by characterizing the Hb Shepherds Bush hemoglobin variant, b 74 -(E 18) Gly [...] >Asp...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{has become}} a serious global health threat and glucose test is very {{important}} for diabetic patients on a daily basis. Traditional blood glucose test uses a <b>lancet</b> <b>device</b> to prick the patient’s finger to get a drop of blood sample for testing. This invasive test causes pain to patient and increases the risk of cross-infection of blood-transmitted diseases. Non-invasive glucose monitoring has become very attractive alternative to blood glucose test. Research has found that other biological samples (e. g. saliva, tears, sweat, urine) also contains trace amount of glucose molecules and they may be used for diabetes diagnosis. However, glucose level in such biological samples is generally too low for traditional sensors. Nanotechnology offers new hope in high-resolution glucose sensing. In this research, we proposed a saliva glucose sensor that combines graphene-based glucose nanosensor with microfluidic biochip to develop a complete lab-on-a-chip (LoC) system for non-invasive glucose sensing. It is designed to collect, prepare and manipulate the microfluidic sample for glucose sensing using graphene-based glucose nanosensor. The key components of the lab-on-a-chip are designed and simulated with COMSOL. The LoC device may be used for non-invasive glucose sensing for diabetes diagnosis and self-monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Summary Objective {{to conduct}} a randomised-controlled trial to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of two heel-prick devices (Tenderfoot and Genie Lancet) used in the newborn-baby screening test. Design a randomised-controlled trial. Participants and setting the homes of 340 healthy term newborn babies discharged from the maternity unit of Stirling Royal Infirmary, Scotland. Data were collected between April and November 2003. Interventions babies were randomly allocated to be tested with either the Tenderfoot or Genie Lancet heel-prick device. Measurements primary study outcomes include (1) quality of the blood sample; (2) time taken to collect the sample; (3) number of heel pricks required to take the sample; (4) whether squeezing of heel was required; (5) pain expressed by the baby; and (6) presence of bruising. A potential intervening variable was {{the experience of the}} midwife. Findings on all outcomes, the Tenderfoot device was more effective than the Genie Lancet. Experienced midwives were more efficient in sample collection. Key Conclusions this study shows that the Tenderfoot device saves significant time for midwifery staff, improves baby care and reduces the need for more than one heel prick at each test, making it superior to the Genie <b>Lancet</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

A high prevalence of diabetes has recently been described at Réunion Island, a French department located in the Indian Ocean. At the University of La Réunion, a laboratory course involving students was designed to teach them blood glucose measurements and to examine the influence of food intake on their glycemic response. Using glucose meters, test strips, <b>lancet</b> <b>devices,</b> and sterile <b>lancets,</b> students determined their basal and postprandial glycemia. After plotting the variation over time of their glycemia, students calculated their glycemic response to a meal as the area under the curve. First, students observed that their glycemia had increased rapidly after food intake to values of 1. 4 g/l and then decreased to normal values, proving {{the existence of a}} physiological regulatory system for glycemia. Using impedance balances, students then determined their body mass index and fat mass percentages. Positive and significant correlations were established between students' fat mass percentages and the glycemic response to the meal. A higher postprandial response was indeed noticed for students having higher fat percentages. Therefore, this laboratory allows students to observe the regulation of glycemia. It also alerts them to the correlation between higher body fat content and a higher glycemic response, which can be related to diabetic disorders. This laboratory {{constitutes an}} active illustration of their plenary lesson in endocrinology and particularly for the session dealing with glucose regulation...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin is an {{important}} neurotransmitter that {{plays a major role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of conditions, including psychiatric disorders. The detection of serotonin typically relies on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), an expensive technique that requires sophisticated equipment and trained personnel, and is not suitable for point-of-care applications. In this contribution, we introduce a novel sensor platform that can measure spiked neurotransmitter concentrations in whole blood samples in a fast and low-cost manner by combining synthetic receptors with a thermal readout technique—the heat-transfer method. In addition, the design of a miniaturized version of the sensing platform is presented that aims to bridge the gap between measurements in a laboratory setting and point-of-care measurements. This fully automated and integrated, user-friendly design features a capillary pumping unit that is compatible with point-of-care sampling techniques such as a blood <b>lancet</b> <b>device</b> (sample volume—between 50 µL and 300 µL). Sample pre-treatment is limited to the addition of an anti-coagulant. With this fully integrated setup, it is possible to successfully discriminate serotonin from a competitor neurotransmitter (histamine) in whole blood samples. This is the first demonstration of a point-of-care ready device based on synthetic receptors for the screening of neurotransmitters in complex matrices, illustrating the sensor’s potential application in clinical research and diagnosis of e. g., early stage depression...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the role of ‘experience’ in performing the heel prick test. Babies (n ¼ 340) were randomly allocated to be tested with either the Tenderfoot or Genie <b>Lancet</b> heel prick <b>device.</b> Testing was conducted by nine midwives (n ¼ 4, experienced, more than 20 years qualified) who performed the heel prick procedure routinely and rotational midwives (n ¼ 5, less experienced, 4 e 8 years qualified) who only performed the heel prick procedure when working in the community. Test technique outcomes investigated included (1) cleaning of heel, (2) babies position, (3) feeding at test, (4) use of soothing words. Other test outcomes (1) quality of the blood sample, (2) number of heel pricks required to take sample, (3) blood flow, (4) presence of bruising (5) time taken to collect sample, (6) time squeezing the heel and (7) time baby cried were also studied. The experienced midwives were more likely to hold the baby during testing but less likely to clean the infants heel prior to the incision. The experienced midwives collected a better quality sample, in less time and required fewer heel pricks than the less experienced midwifery group...|$|R
40|$|Mapping of the Collections of History of Medicinein Estonian MuseumsLeili Kriis, Sirje SisaskUniversity of Tartu MuseumThe {{work plan}} of the University of Tartu Museum for the followingyears {{includes}} creating a new exposition for the university’s Old AnatomicalTheatre. This made us wonder, what kinds of collections ofhistory of medicine are there in other Estonian museums. A greatopportunity to obtain information opened up with the Ministry ofCulture’s support programme for developing museums that we participatedin with our project “Mapping of the Collections of History ofMedicine in Estonian Museums” from 17 April to 31 December 2013. To obtain data, we designed a questionnaire for the chief treasurersof the museums. Based on the answers we received, the followingoverview was compiled. At the time we conducted the survey, {{more than half of}} the materialsof history of medicine in the museum collections had beenentered also into the Estonian Museum Information System MuIS. Keywords related to the topic of medicine have been used. Most ofthe corresponding materials in Estonian museums are connected topharmacies (material objects as well as photographs and archive materials),and furnishings of dental practices (Pärnu Museum, VõruCounty Museum, etc.). Regional museums also contain objects of veterinarymedicine. There are rare items of history of medicine suchas an inoculation knife, cupping <b>lancets,</b> bloodletting <b>devices,</b> a bonesaw, an irritation instrument, healing stones, a homoeopathic pharmacy,and many more. The most noteworthy archive materials areprobably the inoculation materials, mud treatment materials (materialsand manuscripts of Dr Hunnius from Haapsalu, mud treatmenthistory of Saaremaa), and manuscripts by medics (historical overviews). Topics like doping (the Estonian Sports Museum), designingmedical institutions (hospitals, sanatoriums, etc.) (Museum of EstonianArchitecture, Museum of Viljandi), diseases and stress, and howthese are reflected in a person’s creative work (Estonian Theatre andMusic Museum) have also been documented. Most valuable are thestories found in the collections of county museums that tell of medicalinstitutions (hospitals, pharmacies, sanatoriums, leprosariums, etc.) that have operated or are operating in the region and reflect the specificcharacter of the region, as well as the materials of well-known localmedics. Also materials related to alternative and folk medicine. Allthis enriches the general picture of the Estonian history of medicine. Our working group reached the conclusion that the contents ofthe MuIS dictionary should be structured in a better manner andsupplemented with topics that are reflected in specific museum collections(alternative medicine, nutrition, environment, etc.). Imagesof museum objects are also important data carriers in the database. Rare historical documents deserve to be digitised as soon as possiblesince they tend to become fragile with time. Regional museumsshould also find room for materials related to the history and doctorsof local medical institutions...|$|R
