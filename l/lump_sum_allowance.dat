40|$|The western {{extension}} {{area of the}} Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) covers five countries: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali (western part), Senegal and Sierra Leone. From 1986 to 1990, national teams employed by the respective governments have been regularly collecting entomological data on the vectors of onchocerciasis in these countries. As in the initial programme area of the OCP, the entomological surveillance network was composed of entomological sectors and subsectors (the latter are called "operational bases" in the western extension). In 1990, 308 staff in 47 capture teams were employed for the entomological surveillance activities in seven sectors and twenty-five operational bases. They included a national coordinator {{as head of the}} teams for each country, a wide range of technicians, and administrative support staff to assist the national coordinator in the overall management of available resources. The national teams worked under the technical responsibility and supervision of WHO/OCP but with no employee/employer relationship between them and WHO, since they were employed and their salaries were paid by their governments. The OCP, however, paid additional <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>allowances</b> to each worker, as well as daily subsistence allowances when away from their duty station. Vehicles, entomological equipment, office supplies and furniture, fuel and lubricants were provided by WHO/OCP. Despite the difficulties encountered in the field, which were often great, and their lower salaries (compared with colleagues paid by WHO/OCP), the technical workers in the national teams performed well by OCP standards, with results as satisfactory as those obtained by the WHO/OCP teams {{in the rest of the}} programme area. The main reasons for the efficiency and dynamism of the national entomological teams are described. The future of these teams after OCP has ceased its activities is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mandatory}} retirement system(MRS) in Japan {{was created}} without {{the tradition of}} employment security immediately after WW‡U. This process was the compromise between the desire for employment security among workers {{and the necessity of}} employment adjustment for managers. Therefore, the MRS in Japan had to be reinforced by the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> retirement <b>allowance</b> and the support from the family members after retirement. The institutional characteristics(not gsocializedhbut g privateh) of retirement process in Japan was embedded at this time. The other institutions of employment system, for example, age-based wage system, were formed, having organic relations with the MRS in 1950 s. Moreover, retirement process became moregforeseeablehand adaptable for Japanese workers by the creation of employment adjustment rules and the raise of retirement allowance in 1960 s. However, the institutional characteristics could not change. The instability of MRS in Japan revealed itself when managers were faced with great need for reduction of aged workers in 1980 s. ...|$|R

As the {{percentages}} of the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> expense used in the Czech Republic are high compared to other EU countries, they are often criticized as distortive and government searches for ways to limit their use. On the other side, the long-standing role of the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> expense in the Czech tax system hinders its decrease. Based on {{the data from the}} personal income tax returns of self-employed we analyze the use of the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> expense in the Czech Republic over the years 2004 to 2012.

The results reported in this paper analyse the data including lump-sum receipts, in line with the SILC approach and CSO practice. However, at a number of points we have also analysed an income construct which excludes both retirement <b>lump</b> <b>sums</b> and redundancy <b>lump</b> <b>sums.</b> We find that inclusion of these <b>lump</b> <b>sums</b> plays a role in the increase in the Gini between 2009 and 2010, raising it by about 0.005, but has little impact over the full period.|$|R
40|$|Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) retirees {{must choose}} between {{receiving}} {{all of their}} retirement benefits as life annuity payments and receiving lower life annuity payments coupled with a partial <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payout. For the median retiree, the expected present value of the incremental life annuity payments is 1. 50 times the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payout, and demand for <b>lump</b> <b>sums</b> is low. This pattern is consistent with value-maximizing decisions by retirees. However, when we exploit variation {{in the value of}} the incremental life annuity payments arising from how PERS calculates retirement benefits, we find robust evidence that demand for <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payouts is higher when the forgone life annuity payments are more valuable. We also find that demand for <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payouts is higher when the <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payout is “large, ” and when equity market returns over the prior 12 months are higher. Collectively, these findings suggest that retirees value incremental life annuity payments at less than their expected present value, either because they do not know how to accurately value life annuities or because they have strong demand for large <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> payouts. In contrast, when we measure variation {{in the value of the}} incremental life annuity payments along a dimension that is easier for retirees to observe and interpret—poor health at retirement—we find evidence consistent with value-maximizing decision-making...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in {{evaluating}} the ongoing shift from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension plans {{is the degree to}} which assets in DC plans will be withdrawn before plan participants reach retirement age. The annual flow of withdrawals from such plans, which are known as <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distributions and which are frequently but not always associated with employment changes, has exceeded $ 100 billion in recent years. This flow is substantially greater than the flow of new contributions to IRAs and other targeted retirement saving programs. This paper draws on data from the 1993 Current Population Survey and the Health and Retirement Survey to summarize the incidence and disposition of <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distributions. We find that while less than half of all <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distributions are rolled over into IRAs or other retirement saving plans, large distributions are substantially more likely to be saved than smaller ones are. Consequently, more than half of the dollars paid out as <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distributions are reinvested. We also explore the correlation between various individual characteristics and the probability of rolling over a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distribution. This is a first step toward developing a model that can be used to evaluate the long- term effects of <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> distributions, or policies that might affect them, on the financial status of elderly households. ...|$|R
