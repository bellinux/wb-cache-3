25|$|Chirped pulse {{amplification}} (CPA) is {{a technique}} for amplifying an ultrashort laser pulse up to the petawatt level with the laser pulse being stretched out temporally and spectrally prior to amplification. CPA is the current state-of-the-art technique which all of the highest power lasers (greater than about 100 terawatts, {{with the exception of}} the ~500 TW National Ignition Facility) in the world currently utilize. Some examples of these lasers are the Vulcan Petawatt Upgrade at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's central laser facility, the Diocles Laser at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Gekko Petawatt laser at the Gekko XII facility in the Institute of <b>Laser</b> <b>Engineering</b> at Osaka University, the OMEGA EP laser at the University of Rochester's Lab for Laser Energetics and the now dismantled petawatt line on the former Nova laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

30|$|The {{application}} of new experimental and theoretical techniques {{together with the}} improvement of traditional ones {{has resulted in a}} great surge in the knowledge of carrier dynamics in nanodevices [16]. The time-dependent aspects in nanodevices naturally become a hot topic which largely comprises of researches on internal transitions between impurity-induced states in a QD. These transitions depend on the spatial restriction imposed by the impurity. As a natural consequence of the said research, the excitation of electrons strongly confined by QDs emanates as an interesting phenomenon that is intimately related to the above dynamical features. Detailed analysis on this aspect is undoubtedly of prime importance because such excitation provides us with ideal systems for use in optoelectronic devices and as <b>lasers.</b> <b>Engineering</b> applications of such excitations further involve optical encoding, multiplexing, photovoltaic, and light-emitting devices. Another aspect that makes excitation phenomenon so much important in QD is the eventual population transfer among the exciton states [17].|$|R
40|$|Wettability {{characteristics}} are believed {{by many to}} be the driving force in applications relating to adhesion. So, gaining an in-depth understanding of the wettability characteristics of materials before and aft er surface treatments is crucial in developing materials with enhanced adhesion properties. This chapter details some of the main competing techniques to <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineering</b> followed by a review of current cutting edge <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineering</b> techniques which are used for wettability and adhesion modulation. A study is provided in detail for laser surface treatment (using IR and UV lasers) of polymeric materials. Sessile drop analysis was used to determine the wettability characteristics of each laser surface treated sample and as-received sample, revealing the presence of a mixed-state wetting regime on some samples. Although this outcome does not follow current and accepted wetting theory, through numerical analysis, generic equations to predict this mixed state wetting regime and the corresponding contact angle are discussed.

40|$|Two {{functionally}} graded coatings {{were prepared}} by different <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineering</b> techniques. <b>Laser</b> cladding of AlSi 40 powder {{leads to the}} formation of functionally graded material (FGM) coating on AI-Si cast alloy substrate. Mapping of strain fields near the laser clad track using the digital image correlation shows a gradual transition of deformation over the interface region and the softening effect in the heat affected zone of the FGM tracks. Specially designed sample with such a coating allows the experimental determination of adhesion strength between FGM coating and substrate. Laser melt injection technique was used to prepare functionally graded WC/TiAl-V metal matrix composite (MMC) coating. Orientation imaging microscopy of reaction zones in this coating shows that crack initiation and crack propagation processes strongly depends on the existence of orientation relationship between the particulate and the new phases formed around it during melt solidification. The wear test performed on this coating at a boundary lubrication condition confirmed the excellent bonding between WC particle and Ti-alloy matrix and results in extreme improvement of wear resistance. In-situ microstructural observations during straining in an environmental scanning electron microscope reveal different failure modes of functionally graded materials prepared by different <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineering</b> techniques...|$|R

40|$|Nanoindentation {{proves to}} be an {{effective}} technique to measure mechanical properties of “composite” materials, as it has high spatial resolution that enables estimation of properties even from fine grains, particles, and precipitates. The elastic modulus, E, of the composite boride coating deposited on AISI 1010 steel using the <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineering</b> (LSE) process has been computed using the nanoindentation technique. The highest E value of 477. 3 GPa was achieved for coating in a sample that contained 0. 69 volume fraction of TiB 2 particles in the coating after processing with the highest laser traverse speed of 33 mm/s. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental computation of the elastic modulus suggests that theoretical elastic modulus values are lower than computed elastic modulus, as the latter includes the effect of dissolution of fine TiB 2 particles in Fe matrix and metastable phase formation such as FeaBb and TimBn. Dissolution of fine TiB 2 particles in the Fe matrix in the coating region has been corroborated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs and corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS) analysis and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern.
