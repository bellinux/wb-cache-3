A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a <b>light</b> <b>year</b> is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one <b>light</b> <b>year</b> every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E

500|$|As the Sun orbits the Milky Way, {{wandering}} stars may approach {{close enough}} to have a disruptive influence on the Solar System.
