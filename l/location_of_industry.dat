50|$|As for {{the causes}} of {{environmental}} inequalities in the UK, the Environment Agency writes: 'The causes of these inequalities are often complex and long-standing.

Often these environmental problems are caused by the actions of others who do not live in the affected community.

50|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, Viernheim was a farming village. Bad harvests and {{widespread}} hunger in 1852 led to 458 inhabitants emigrating in this year to North America. With industrialization and the opening of the Oberrheinische Eisenbahn (a regional narrow-gauge railway still serving a roughly triangular route among Weinheim, Mannheim and Heidelberg) in 1887, the town began to become more of a workers’ residential community as many inhabitants found work in the factories in nearby Mannheim and Weinheim. Many workers, however, kept farming as a sideline. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> in Viernheim itself began {{with the opening of the}} Weinheim-Worms railway (now mostly derelict) in 1905, and further strengthened after the Second World War, bringing along with it a sharp rise in population.

50|$|According to the {{original}} 1845 cadastral survey, it seems that destitution (division of inheritance, hunger, early death) and the 1848/1849 political upheavals were the main forces driving people to emigrate from the region. Many names are accompanied by notes such as “out of the country - {{in the land of}} America”. Nevertheless, {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century, ever more people were coming to Waldmohr, even with the fee for becoming a local citizen having been set at 102.85 marks in 1878. During the building of the Nordfeldbahndamm - a railway embankment - between 1902 and 1904, several Italians were employed who settled in the village. The two world wars exacted a heavy toll in blood, particularly the Second World War, which claimed many victims. With the separation of the Saar from the rest of Germany after both world wars, many customs officials and their families came to Waldmohr. Both in Weimar times and after the Second World War, miners’ families moved to the Ruhr area or the Aachen mining region either out of need for work or for better wages. In the 1940s and 1950s, ethnic Germans driven out of Germany’s former eastern territories came to settle in Waldmohr. Only the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> and opening of valuable building land over the past few decades, however, coupled with good infrastructure development over that time, has led to steady population growth through migration, mainly from the Homburg area, Neunkirchen and the Glan valley. Also, quite a few Turkish families came beginning in 1971. After the Soviet Union’s downfall, many ethnically German families from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - former Volga Germans and Black Sea Germans - came to the village. The commonest names in the village these days are still Bächle, Bauer, Becker, Blum, Braun, Burkart/Burkhardt, Ecker, Emich, Hoffmann, Jung, Kampa, Keller, Kiefer, Klein, Krupp, Leibrock, Lothschütz, Maurer, Metzger, Müller, Rapp, Schäfer, Schmidt/Schmitt, Schneider, Schwarz, Simon, Trumm, Wagner, Weber, Weiß/Weis/Weiss, Wolf, Wunn and Zimmer.|$|E
