The Reynolds number based on the step 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mean</b> <b>height,</b> Reh, is 3450 and the ratio of the boundary layer thickness to the step 2 ̆ 7 s height is δ/h = 8. The roughness topography on the top surface of the rough step is replicated from a realistic turbine blade and is intrinsically three-dimensional and highly irregular. The surface topographies of the coarse scale-resolution approximations of the rough step are obtained from a multi-resolutional analysis using discrete wavelet transform(DWT). Mean flow structures, Reynolds normal and shear stresses, quadrant analysis of instantaneous ejections and sweeps, spanwise vorticity and characteristics of the coherent spanwise vortices are first compared between flows over the smooth and rough forward-facing steps. The results illustrate that the rough surface conditions on the top surface of the forward-facing step tend to weaken the separated flows from the sharp edge. The comparison of the results at two different measurement positions indicates that the slope of the roughness profile immediately after the step 2 ̆ 7 s edge {{plays an important role in}} affecting the flow. This is probably due to the local pressure gradients induced by the roughness topography. A relatively strong favorable pressure gradient may prevent the generation of a recirculation region downstream of the step. The effects of roughness length scales on the forward-facing turbulent flow are explored by comparing the characteristics of the flow over the rough step and its two approximations, A 6 and A 4, which contain about 44...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring ocean waves plays {{a crucial}} role in, for example, coastal {{environmental}} and protection studies. Traditional methods for measuring ocean waves are based on ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers. However, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been introduced recently and has the advantage of being smaller, less expensive, and not requiring calibration in comparison with the traditional methods. Therefore, for accurately measuring ocean waves using GPS, further research on the separation of the wave signals from the vertical GPS-mounted carrier displacements is still necessary. In order to contribute to this topic, we present a novel method that combines complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) with a wavelet threshold denoising model (i. e., CEEMD-Wavelet). This method seeks to extract wave signals with less residual noise and without losing useful information.

60|$|But {{in those}} cases in which plants {{of the same species}} were {{observed}} during several generations, a general average of their heights in all the generations together may be made; and such averages are given in Table 7/A; for instance, under Ipomoea the general average for the plants of all ten generations is as 100 for the crossed, to 77 for the self-fertilised plants. This having been done in each case in which more than one generation was raised, it is easy to calculate the average of the average heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of all the species included in Table 7/A. It should however be observed that as only a few plants of some species, whilst a considerable number of others, were measured, the value of the <b>mean</b> or average <b>heights</b> of the several species is very different. Subject to this source of error, it may be worth while to give the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the fifty-four species in Table 7/A; and the result is, calling the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants 100, that of the self-fertilised plants is 87. But it is a better plan to divide the fifty-four species into three groups, as was done with the previously given eighty-three cases. The first group consists of species of which the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised plants are within five per cent of 100; so that the crossed and self-fertilised plants are approximately equal; and of such species there are twelve about which nothing need be said, the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised being of course very nearly 100, or exactly 99.58. The second group consists of the species, thirty-seven in number, of which the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants exceed that of the self-fertilised plants by more than five per cent; and the mean of their <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> is to that of the self-fertilised plants as 100 to 78.

Therefore if we exclude the species which are approximately equal, there are thirty-seven species in which the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the crossed plants exceeds that of the self-fertilised by twenty-two per cent; whereas there are only five species in which the mean of the <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> of the self-fertilised plants exceeds that of the crossed, and this only by nine per cent.|$|R

One is whether, and how, growth patterns of stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> {{have changed in}} Hungary {{in the last few}} decades, and the other is whether recently observed increases in mean annual temperature might have caused changes in growth trends. Changes in tree growth were investigated for beech (Fagus sylvatica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) by comparing stand <b>mean</b> <b>heights</b> over age using data from the forest inventories of 1981 and 2001, and for sessile oak using stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> data from permanent sample plots since 1961. Tree growth was found to have accelerated for each species mentioned, with Turkey oak showing the largest acceleration. To study the second issue, stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> was related to elevation, wich in turn was related to mean annual temperature and precipitation. For these analyses, too, data of many thousands of stands in the forest inventory was used. Stand <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> was found to increase with decreasing elevation, i. e. with increasing mean annual temperature, {{for each of the three}} species. As the annual precipitation and air humidity decreases with decreasing elevation, it was concluded that increases of mean annual temperature could positively have affected tree growth in the last few decades.

40|$|The {{application}} of airborne laser scanning (ALS) technologies in forest inventories has shown great potential {{to improve the}} efficiency of forest planning activities. Precise estimates, fast assessment and relatively low complexity can explain the good results in terms of efficiency. The evolution of GPS and inertial measurement technologies, {{as well as the}} observed lower assessment costs when these technologies are applied to large scale studies, can explain the increasing dissemination of ALS technologies. The observed good quality of results can be expressed by estimates of volumes and basal area with estimated error below the level of 8. 4 %, {{depending on the size of}} sampled area, the quantity of laser pulses per square meter and the number of control plots. This paper analyzes the potential of an ALS assessment to produce certain forest inventory statistics in plantations of cloned Eucalyptus spp with precision equal of superior to conventional methods. The statistics of interest in this case were: volume, basal area, <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> and dominant trees <b>mean</b> <b>height.</b> The ALS flight for data assessment covered two strips of approximately 2 by 20 Km, in which clouds of points were sampled in circular plots with a radius of 13 m. Plots were sampled in different parts of the strips to cover different stand ages. The clouds of points generated by the ALS assessment: overall <b>height</b> <b>mean,</b> standard error, five percentiles (height under which we can find 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % of the ALS points above ground level in the cloud), and density of points above ground level in each percentile were calculated. The ALS statistics were used in regression models to estimate <b>mean</b> diameter, <b>mean</b> <b>height,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> of dominant trees, basal area and volume. Conventional forest inventory sample plots provided real data. For volume, an exploratory assessment involving different combinations of ALS statistics allowed for the definition of the most promising relationships and fitting tests based on well known forest biometric models. The models based on ALS statistics that produced the best results involved: the 30 % percentile to estimate mean diameter (R(2) = 0, 88 and MQE%= 0, 0004); the 10 % and 90 % percentiles to estimate <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> (R(2) = 0, 94 and MQE%= 0, 0003); the 90 % percentile to estimate dominant height (R(2) = 0, 96 and MQE%= 0, 0003); the 10 % percentile and <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> of ALS points to estimate basal area (R(2) = 0, 92 and MQE%= 0, 0016); and, to estimate volume, age and the 30 % and 90 % percentiles (R(2) = 0, 95 MQE%= 0, 002).

The second rotation duplicated the first rotation seed source, site preparation, planting method, and density. The comparison between the two rotations {{is based on the}} <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> differential for the spectrum and by soil type for each age class. There is a significant rotation 1 minus rotation 2 height difference for all age classes. Rotation 1 is 1. 9 and 5. 4 ft higher for <b>mean</b> <b>height</b> at ages 2 and 20. Rotation 1 generally experienced more favorable precipitation, fo...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mean</b> sea-surface <b>height</b> and the {{gravitational}} geoid are presently estimated via near-surface velocity changes and concurrent sea-level changes along an ascending Geosat subtrack. The velocity measurements {{were made on}} three traverses, within ten days, of a Geosat subtrack, {{by means of an}} acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The <b>mean</b> sea-surface <b>height</b> was estimated as the difference between the instantaneous sea-surface height from ADCP and the Geosat residual sea level. In order to minimize mesoscale errors in the estimate, the along-track geoid estimate was computed as the difference between <b>mean</b> sea-level <b>height</b> from the Geosat Exact Repeat Mission and an estimate of the <b>mean</b> sea-surface <b>height...</b>|$|R
