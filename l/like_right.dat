500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All I really believe in is this fucking moment, <b>like</b> <b>right</b> now. And that, actually, is what the whole album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go"). The song [...] "Jeremy" [...] and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.|$|E

On October 27, 2015, Christian's profile {{was moved to the}} alumni section at WWE.com, and noted that he had left active competition. On the March 2, 2016, episode of Talk is Jericho, Christian said that while he has had no formal discussion with management regarding his retirement, he is unlikely to wrestle again.

500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, <b>like</b> <b>right</b> out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E

The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else.

We {{were living in a}} toilet, <b>like</b> <b>right</b> next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} to human well-being {{emphasizes the importance}} of freedom of choice, individual heterogeneity and the multi-dimensional nature of welfare.

60|$|When the people's minds had had {{a little}} time to cool, they were ready enough to {{acknowledge}} their mistake in imagining a similarity between General Blood-and-Thunder's truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain-side. But now, again, there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers, affirming that the likeness of the Great Stone Face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman. He, like Mr. Gathergold and Old Blood-and-Thunder, was a native of the valley, but had left it in his early days, and taken up the trades of law and politics. Instead of the rich man's wealth and the warrior's sword, he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than both together. So wonderfully eloquent was he, that whatever he might choose to say, his auditors {{had no choice but to}} believe him; wrong looked <b>like</b> <b>right,</b> and right like wrong; for when it pleased him, he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath, and obscure the natural daylight with it. His tongue, indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes it rumbled like the thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music. It was the blast of war, the song of peace; and it seemed to have a heart in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was a wondrous man; and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable success,--when it had been heard in halls of state, and in the courts of princes and potentates,--after it had made him known all over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to shore,--it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the Presidency. Before this time,--indeed, as soon as he began to grow celebrated,--his admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the Great Stone Face; and so much were they struck by it, that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the Popedom, nobody ever becomes President without taking a name other than his own.|$|E
