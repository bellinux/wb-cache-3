The pion model we adopt is well constrained by previous studies to explain the pion properties in vacuum. In order to consistently incorporate the constituent up and down quarks of the pion immersed in symmetric nuclear matter, we use the quark-meson coupling model, which has been widely applied to various hadronic and nuclear phenomena in a nuclear medium with success. We predict the in-medium modifications of the pion <b>lectromagnetic</b> form factor, charge radius and weak decay constant in symmetric nuclear matter. Comment: Use revtex 4, 7 figures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for the definition and identification of a transistor model suitable for low-noise amplifier (LNA) design. The resulting model is very robust to layout modifications (i. e., source degeneration) providing accurate predictions of device noise-performance and small-signal parameters. Moreover, the described procedure is very robust since {{it does not require}} any numerical optimization, with possibly related problems like local minima and unphysical model parameters. The adopted model topology is based on a lumped element parasitic network and a black-box intrinsic device, which are both identified on the basis of full-wave <b>lectromagnetic</b> simulations, as well as noise and -parameter measurements. The procedure has been applied to three GaN HEMTs having different peripheries and a Ku-band LNA has been designed, demonstrating a very good agreement between measurements and predicted results...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of charged particles in low-frequency geomagnetic pulsations is examined with particu-lar emphasis {{on what a}} spacecraft-borne detector would observe. We concentrate {{on the effects of}} purely transverse <b>lectromagnetic</b> signals. The time scale of a particle's motion relative to the wave period is shown to determine the nature of its response. For low-energy particles, the acceleration in the last gyro-period before detection is what matters. At higher energies, what has occurred over recent bounce and drift motions becomes increasingly important and convection of gradients by the wave E x B drift must be considered. Distinguishing features such as phase differences between signals in back-to-back detectors or between channels of different energy are catalogued. In particular, we assess the detectability of reso-nance effects in the light of detector characteristics and finite signal bandwidth. Recent observations are used to illustrate the ideas developed...|$|E

We have presented a time-frequency visualization of AE signals as a method to detect the quench. We can detect very small AE signals regardless of <b>lectromagnetic</b> noises and can find {{the time of the}} AE occurrence and the frequency bands of AE signals by using this method. Recently it has been presented that YBCO superconductors are delaminated and degraded by a transverse tensile stress. The delamination is accompanied with AE signals. Also, it is known that amplitudes and frequency bands of AE signals vary with causes of AE occurrence.

The measurements were performed contactlessly by video techniques with subsequent digital image processing. Linear and volume thermal Expansion coefficients were measured hereby from image data. An anomaly of volume changes near the solidus temperature is visible. Viscosity and surface tension were determined by the oscillating drop technique using optic and electronic data.

The n umerical model e mploys " loose " t wo-way c oupling of t he e <b>lectromagnetic</b> a nalysis with the elastic-plastic structural analysis. An electromagnetic fruite element code is used to model the time varying currents that are discharged through the coil {{in order to obtain}} the transient magnetic forces that are imparted to the workpiece. The body forces generated by electromagnetic induction are then used as the loading condition to model the high rate deformation of the workpiece using an explicit dynamic fmite element code. A series of high rate electromagnetic forming experiments are performed on 1 and 1. 6 mm AA 5754 and 1 mm AA 5182 aluminum alloy sheet. T lie experiments consider free forming, while also serving as a basis to validate the predictive capability of the numerical models. The experiments exhibited high rate formability limits that were similar to conventional quasi-static forming limits. The numerical model accurately predicted the final geometry of the samples as well as the measured strain distributions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Generally speaking, seismoelectric {{modeling}} is a prospecting method {{based on}} seismic and electromagnetic waves, in which waves {{generated by a}} seismic source at the boundary of the two environments generate a relative fluid-solid motion formed {{as a result of}} antagonism between the elastic properties of the environment with the saturated fluid. This research has as its objective, a study of the effect of an electric field due to DC current on the propagation of seismic waves by pseudo spectral time domain method, or the more general concept of seismoelectric coupling effect. In this research, poroelastic equations were used for seismic waves and Maxwell’s equations for <b>lectromagnetic</b> waves. Additionally, the seismoelectric effect or charge density, electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity function, fluid viscosity and zeta potential were determined.

It provides a 1 mrad/m. kick for a 1 GeV electron beam, with transition times below 25 ns. and a 1 % flat top. The +/- 10 KV. driver uses a novel switching technique, based on MOSFET power transistors, which allows complete control over the kicker timing and simplifies the construction greatly. Calculations show that the reliability of such a driver is orders of magnitude better than present designs. I. DESCRIPTION Fig. 1 - T. E. M. Kicker Block Diagram The MIT-Bates Pulse Stretcher Ring is designed to expand the linac duty cycle (now < 1 %) to 85 % or greater. A linac pulse of 1. 2 ps is injected into the ring, filling it twice. Two kicker deflectors are turned on at injection time, and then turned off very fast to minimize circulating beam losses [l]. If the kicker plates ’ voltage and current are related by their characteristic impedance Zo, a wave travels along them in TEM mode, producing transverse B and E lields.

40|$|The {{physical}} content ofa non-covariant quantum-field theoretic transport formalism for strong-field QED {{is addressed}} within an integral {{formulation of the}} evolution equations which highlights the relation to acoustic and Zitterbewegung modes of the field-free limit. Through the computation within this framework of the electric susceptibility of the vacuum at the one-loop level, it is established that the off-shell behaviour of the electron-positron field is correctly incorporated. The Zitterbewegung mode is seen to be solely responsible at the one-loop level for vacuum polarization. Implications for the full renormalisation f the theory are taken up. 1. In t roduct ion Among the attempts to formulate relativistic quantum field theories in a manner useful for the non-perturbative treatment of transport and non-equilibrium phenomena [1 - 3], a promising option is the equal-time approach introduced in [4] for problems in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) involving strong classical electrodynamic fields. Its most apparent advantage is that the dynamical problem can be expressed as a conventional initial value problem, and hence should be ameneable to numerical solution. It {{is not clear that}} other formulations [1], which insist on Lorentz covariance, admit similar treatment. Given that analytic solutions to QED problems involving classical electromagnetic f elds are available only for a limited number of idealised field configurations (namely, the plane-wave <b>lectromagnetic</b> f eld and constant homogeneous fields of infinite extent), there is certainly roo...|$|E

However, designing the hemmed unión is a complicated task and is deeply influenced by the mechanical properties of the materail of the bent part. Significant problems can arise in this operation when bending aluminum alloys, because cracks can appera due to the localized strain during hemming {{as a result of the}} low ductility of automotive aluminum alloys. This paper presents the devlopment of the <b>lectromagnetic</b> forming (EMF) technology for auto body-in-white parts hemming. A relatively simple experimental procedure to perform a hemming operation based on th eprinciple of EMF is presented in order to compare the variation in the quality parameters of a hemmed joint.

40|$|Electromagnetic wave {{propagation}} is currently {{present in the}} vast majority of situations which occur in veryday life, whether in mobile communications, DTV, satellite tracking, broadcasting, etc. Because of this the study of increasingly complex means of propagation of <b>lectromagnetic</b> waves has become necessary in order to optimize resources and increase the capabilities of the devices as required by the growing demand for such services. Within the electromagnetic {{wave propagation}} different parameters are considered that characterize it under various circumstances and of particular importance are the reflectance and transmittance. There are several methods or the analysis of the reflectance and transmittance such as the method of approximation by boundary condition, the plane wave expansion method (PWE), etc., but this work focuses on the WKB and SPPS methods. The implementation of the WKB method is relatively simple but is found to be relatively efficient only when working at high frequencies. The SPPS method (Spectral Parameter Powers Series) based on the theory of pseudoanalytic functions, is used to solve this problem through a new representation for solutions of Sturm Liouville equations and has recently proven to be a powerful tool to solve different boundary value and eigenvalue problems. Moreover, it has a very suitable structure for numerical implementation, which in this case took place in the Matlab software for the valuation of both conventional and turning points profiles. The comparison between the two methods allows us to obtain valuable information about their perfor mance which is useful for determining the validity and propriety of their application for solving problems where these parameters are calculated in real life applications...|$|E
