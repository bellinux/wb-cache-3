40|$|Two nonoverlapping {{autosomal}} inversions defined unusual neo-sex chromosomes in the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor). Like other neo-sex chromosomes, {{these were}} normally heterozygous, present only in one sex, and suppressed recombination around a sex-determining <b>master</b> <b>switch.</b> Their unusual properties originated from the anomalous Hessian fly sex determination {{system in which}} postzygotic chromosome elimination is used to establish the sex-determining karyotypes. This system permitted {{the evolution of a}} <b>master</b> <b>switch</b> (Chromosome maintenance, Cm) that acts maternally. All of the offspring of females that carry Cm-associated neo-sex chromosomes attain a female-determining somatic karyotype and develop as females. Thus, the chromosomes act as maternal effect neo-W's, or W-prime (W′) chromosomes, where ZW′ females mate with ZZ males to engender female-producing (ZW′) and male-producing (ZZ) females in equal numbers. Genetic mapping and physical mapping identified the inversions. Their distribution was determined in nine populations. Experimental matings established the association of the inversions with Cm and measured their recombination suppression. The inversions are the functional equivalent of the sciarid X-prime chromosomes. We speculate that W′ chromosomes exist in a variety of species that produce unisexual broods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In general, the <b>master</b> <b>switch</b> {{gene for}} sex determi-nation is {{expressed}} {{for a limited}} period during the early embryonic stage. To increase {{our understanding of the}} sex determination mechanism in Bombyx mori, {{it is important to understand}} when sex determination takes place. To examine the key stages for sex determination in this insect, we focused on the expression patterns of Bmdsx (a double-switch gene in the sex determination cascade ofB. mori) and BmIMP (a gene expressed specifically in males involved in male-specific splicing of Bmdsx). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that male-type Bmdsx expression was ob-served in females at 27 and 29 h after oviposition (hao), and finally disappeared at 32 hao. Moreover, BmIMP mRNAwas also expressed in these females, and its expression level was comparable to that of the male-type Bmdsx mRNA. These results demonstrated that female embryos before 32 hao can showmale-type expression of Bmdsx and BmIMP, suggesting that sex determination occurs between 29 and 32 hao, which correspond to the developmental stages from the head lobe differentiation to spoon-shaped embryo stages. This also sug-gests that the <b>master</b> <b>switch</b> gene for sex determination of B. mori is expressed in females during this period and represses the male-specific mode of expression in sex-determining genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} that AC elements coordinated {{the regulation of}} genes belonging to the entire lignin biosynthetic pathway was the first breakthrough in understanding how lignin biosynthesis is regulated. Since then, tremendous {{progress has been made}} in the identification and characterization of many transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the genes of the phenylpropanoid branch pathway leading to lignin. A major breakthrough consisted in the discovery of a hierarchical transcriptional network regulating the biosynthesis of lignified secondary walls (SWs) in Arabidopsis. The NAC TFs (VND/NST/SND) work as the first layer of <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> activating the whole SW biosynthetic network through the regulation of a cascade of downstream TFs. Among these, MYB 46 / 83 act as a second layer of <b>master</b> <b>switches.</b> Recent findings, however, reveal that the regulation of SW formation is far more complex than initially thought, involving both positive and negative regulators, dual function regulators, feedback loops, combinatorial complexes and cross talk between pathways. Finally, because of the great potential that lignocellulosic biomass represents for the production of bioenergy, there is a great interest in further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of lignified SW and subsequently applying this knowledge to improve their saccharification potential for the generation of biofuels...|$|R

40|$|Species from {{productive}} and unproductive habitats differ inherently in their relative growth rate (RGR) {{and a wide}} range of correlated quantitative traits. We investigated the genetic basis of this trait complex, and specifically assessed whether it is under the control of just one or a few genes that can act as <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> by simultaneously affecting a range of traits in the complex. To address this problem, we crossed two Hordeum spontaneum lines originating from two habitats that differ in productivity. The F 3 offspring, in which parental alleles are present in different combinations due to recombination and segregation, was analysed for RGR and its underlying components (leaf area ratio, unit leaf rate, photosynthesis, respiration), {{as well as a number}} of other physiological and morphological parameters. For this intra-specific comparison, we found a complex of positively and negatively correlated traits, which was quite similar to what is generally observed across species. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis showed three major and one minor QTL for RGR. Most other variables of the growth-trait complex showed fewer QTLs that were typically scattered over various locations on the genome. Thus, at least in H. spontaneum, we found no evidence for regulation of the trait complex by one or two <b>master</b> <b>switches.</b> [KEYWORDS: Specific leaf area; Unit leaf rate; Quantitative trait loci; Trait complex; Photosynthesis...|$|R
