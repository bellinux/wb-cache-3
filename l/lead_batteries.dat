5000|$|The most {{important}} use of lead dioxide is as the cathode of <b>lead</b> acid <b>batteries.</b> Its utility {{arises from the}} anomalous metallic conductivity of PbO2.

40|$|The archival {{value of}} this paper is the {{investigation}} of novel methods to recover lead (II) ions from spent <b>lead</b> acid <b>battery</b> electrodes to be used directly as electrolyte for a soluble <b>lead</b> flow <b>battery.</b> The methods involved heating electrodes of spent <b>lead</b> acid <b>batteries</b> in methanesulfonic acid and hydrogen peroxide to dissolve solid lead and lead dioxide out of the electrode material.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} mined lead ore is galena (lead sulfide). 4 {{million metric tons}} of lead are newly mined each year, mostly in China, Australia, the United States, and Peru. The ores are mixed with coke and limestone and roasted to produce pure lead. Most lead is recycled from <b>lead</b> <b>batteries.</b> The total amount of lead ever mined by humans amounts to 350 million metric tons.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, most {{electric}} vehicles have used lead-acid batteries {{due to their}} mature technology, high availability, and low cost (exception: some early EVs, such as the Detroit Electric, used a nickel-iron battery.) Like all batteries, these have an environmental impact through their construction, use, disposal or recycling. On the upside, vehicle battery recycling rates top 95% in the United States. Deep-cycle <b>lead</b> <b>batteries</b> are expensive and have a shorter life than the vehicle itself, typically needing replacement every 3 years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toxicity}} {{levels and}} {{environmental impact of}} nickel metal hydride batteries—the type currently used in hybrids—are much lower than batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium according to one source. Another source claims nickel metal hydride batteries are much more toxic than <b>lead</b> <b>batteries,</b> also that recycling them and disposing of them safely is difficult. [...] In general various soluble and insoluble nickel compounds, such as nickel chloride and nickel oxide, have known carcinogenic effects in chick embryos and rats. The main nickel compound in NiMH batteries is nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), which is used as the positive electrode.|$|E

Their pontoons are made out of abrasion resistant PVC and nylon with aluminum, steel and/or plastic frames for support. They are powered with paddles, oars and often with electric trolling motors using deep cycle <b>lead</b> <b>batteries.</b> Commonly they are equipped with motor mount, battery storage area, fishing rod holders, canopy, fishfinder mount, small anchor and other required fishing gear. Such boats are suitable for ponds, lakes, rivers and seas during calm weather. However, due to light weight, they are susceptible to waves and windy conditions. Nonetheless, such boats are often used even for big game fishing.|$|E
50|$|Solar powered {{refrigerators}} {{are characterized}} by thick insulation {{and the use of}} a DC (not AC) compressor. Traditionally solar-powered refrigerators and vaccine coolers use a combination of solar panels and <b>lead</b> <b>batteries</b> to store energy for cloudy days and at night in the absence of sunlight to keep their contents cool. These fridges are expensive and require heavy lead-acid batteries which tend to deteriorate, especially in hot climates, or are misused for other purposes. In addition, the batteries require maintenance, must be replaced approximately every three years, and must be disposed of as hazardous wastes possibly resulting in lead pollution. These problems and the resulting higher costs have been an obstacle for the use of solar powered refrigerators in developing areas.|$|E

50|$|Type 032-1 is the unarmed {{prototype}} of the Type 032 series, and eventually, {{it is also the}} only one completed among the series. Political upheaval has caused numerous problems in that the subsystems could not be ready because many subsystems delivered was in such poor quality that they were rejected immediately upon inspection. Type 032 is powered by <b>lead</b> <b>batteries</b> used by railway cargo carts. Construction was finally completed in November 1958 at Jiangnan Shipyard, but sea trials had to be conducted at Lushunkou. The reason to select Lushunkou as the test site is because water depth averages only 70 meters in Lushunkou, much shallower than that of Shanghai region, so if accident occurs during sea trials, {{it would be easier to}} carry out rescue missions. In addition, Lushunkou is also the only base in China at the time where Chinese submarine fleet is stationed, and the commander of the base at the time, Major general Liu Huaqing provided great support to the program. In order to make the trip, Type 032-1 had to be first loaded on a barge at Jiangnan Shipyard to be shipped to the Shanghai railway station in the north via Huangpu River. The midget sub was then loaded on a flatbed railway cart to be transported to Lushunkou. Crew to conduct sea trials also traveled by the same cargo train, with a temporary hut built on one of the flatbed carts of the same train. After three days travel by railway, the midget sub reached its destination and was transferred to a pier at the base, with sea trials immediate followed.|$|E
