50|$|In the 2nd stage of separation, {{the liquid}} with {{remaining}} gas flows along a horizontal section of pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in the horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle}} of the pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> is controlled by a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to the control valve and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> down. Conversely, as <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> goes goes down, the control valve beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> to rise. In essence, the control valve modulates to maintain the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> {{in the middle of}} the horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream. All of the free gas removed in the horizontal section joins the gas run through a connecting run and is measured in the gas leg. The liquid, now free of gas drops to a liquid run for measurement.|$|R

The strip caster {{has been used}} for producing ferrous and nonferrous sheets.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} assessment of two types of Long Period Fiber Grating (LPFG) -based sensors including a mobile <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor and a reflective sensor for the measurement of <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity. Shewhart control charts {{were used to assess}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensing capacity and reliability of the mobile CO 2 -laser engraved LPFG sensor. There were ten groups of different <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment and each group underwent ten repeated wavelength shift measurements. The results showed that all measurands were within the control limits; thus, this mobile sensor was reliable and exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. In addition, a reflective sensor consisting of five LPFGs in series with a reflective end has been developed to evaluate the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity. These five LPFGs were fabricated by the electrical arc discharge method and the reflective end was coated with silver by Tollen’s test. After each <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> experiment was performed five times, the average values of the resonance wavelength shifts for LPFG Nos. 1 – 5 were in the range of 1. 35 – 9. 14 nm. The experimental findings showed that the reflective sensor could be used to automatically monitor five fixed <b>liquid</b> <b>levels.</b> This reflective sensor also exhibited at least 100 -cm <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement capacity. The mechanism of the fluid-flow velocity sensor was based on analyzing the relationship among the optical power, time, and the LPFG’s length. There were two types of fluid-flow velocity measurements: inflow and drainage processes. The differences between the LPFG-based fluid-flow velocities and the measured average fluid-flow velocities were found in the range of 8. 7 – 12. 6 %. For the first time to our knowledge, we have demonstrated the feasibility of <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> and fluid-flow velocity sensing with a reflective LPFG-based sensor without modifying LPFGs or coating chemical compounds...|$|R

40|$|A novel (to {{the best}} of our knowledge) <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor based on {{multimode}} interference (MMI) effects is proposed and demonstrated.

We show that the sensor exhibits a highly linear response with the sensing range and multiplexed operations easily controlled by just modifying the length of the no-core fiber.
