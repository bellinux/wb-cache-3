5|$|In the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of 1887, Congress {{passed the}} Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in the new Congress the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> {{to vote for the}} Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent. He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service reform bill that attracted the votes of many reform-minded Republicans. Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{supported}} some LGBT rights. He {{voted to}} prohibit job {{discrimination based on}} sexual orientation, and was a co-sponsor of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Specter was opposed to same-sex marriage, but was also opposed to a federal ban and supported civil unions. He also became opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act which he once supported. Specter {{voted in favor of}} repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell in the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the 111th Congress.|$|E

50|$|Since 1935 {{there have}} been 16 <b>lame-duck</b> <b>sessions.</b> The most recent one {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} the 113th Congress in 2014. This report examines only the specific lame duck sessions that have occurred since 1935, not those that occurred routinely before this date, as explained in the following section.|$|R
50|$|Most commonly, <b>lame-duck</b> <b>sessions</b> have {{convened in}} the latter half of November. The latest date of reconvening after an {{election}} was that of the 80th Congress on December 31, 1948. Except for years when Congress took no election recess, the earliest reconvening of both houses occurred in 1980, when the 97th Congress returned on November 12, but in 1954 (83rd Congress), the Senate alone returned on November 8. Congress also reconvened on relatively early dates in 2000 (106th Congress), when the House returned on November 13 and the Senate on November 14, and in 1944 (78th Congress), when both houses returned on November 14.|$|R
5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In the June 2009 {{legislative}} elections, Kirchner {{was defeated}} by Francisco de Narváez of the Union PRO coalition for National Deputy of Buenos Aires Province. The Front for Victory was defeated in the Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba, and the Kirchners lost the Congressional majority. Voter disenchantment with the Kirchners was caused by inflation, crime and the previous year's agricultural conflict, which cost them rural support. The Kirchners pushed a media law through during the Congress' <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session.</b> The Kirchners described it as an antitrust law to limit media ownership, but critics considered instead that {{it was used to}} reduce the freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Weaver {{returned}} to the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for the direct election of Senators. After his term expired in March, he resumed his speaking tour, promoting the Greenback Party across the nation. He and EdwardH. Gillette, another Iowa Greenback Congressman, bought the Iowa Tribune in 1882 to help spread the Greenback message. That same year, Weaver ran for his old 6th district seat in the House against the incumbent Republican, MarsenaE. Cutts. This time the Democrats and Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and Weaver finished a distant second. Cutts died before taking office, and the Republicans offered to let Weaver run unopposed in the special election if he rejoined their party; he declined, and JohnC. Cook, a Democrat, won the seat.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lame-duck</b> <b>sessions</b> do {{not usually}} occur in {{countries}} under a parliamentary form of government, whether the Westminster system or other models. Under a parliamentary system {{there are usually}} no fixed dates for elections or the beginning of terms, so that a new session of parliament will always begin with its first meeting after an election has been held. Often the previous parliament is dissolved {{by the head of}} state {{at the request of the}} head of government, therefore even in an emergency there is no parliament to call after the final session until the new parliament has been elected. Any cabinet ministers that were members of the now dissolved parliament will serve in an [...] "acting" [...] or [...] "caretaker" [...] capacity until the new parliament convenes.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{a debate}} about whether to ratify the treaty {{took place during the}} lead-up to the 2010 midterm {{elections}} and in the <b>lame-duck</b> congressional <b>session</b> afterward. While one public opinion poll showed broad support for ratification, another showed general skepticism over nuclear arms reductions.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 {{bankruptcy}} {{bill was}} actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. The United States House of Representatives approved a version titled the [...] "Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999" [...] and the Senate approved {{a slightly different}} version in 2000. After {{the differences in the}} bills were reconciled, Congress passed the [...] "Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000". President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a [...] "pocket veto" [...] by waiting for the <b>lame-duck</b> congressional <b>session</b> to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto. Professor Elizabeth Warren, a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing: ...|$|R
5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The same Senate {{that had}} {{rejected}} the Tyler–Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session.</b> (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2010, Secretary Clinton {{returned}} {{to the floor of}} the Senate during the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the 111th Congress to witness the ratification, by a 71–26 margin, of the New START treaty. Clinton had spent the several days beforehand repeatedly calling wavering senators and seeking to gain their support.|$|E
25|$|In {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1800, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams, becoming the third President of the United States. Although the election was decided on February 17, 1801, Jefferson did not take office until March 4, 1801. Until that time, outgoing president Adams and the Federalist-controlled 6th Congress were still in power. During this <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session,</b> Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801. This Act modified the Judiciary Act of 1789 in establishing ten new district courts, expanding the number of circuit courts from three to six, and adding additional judges to each circuit, giving the President the authority to appoint Federal judges and justices of the peace. The act also {{reduced the number of}} Supreme Court justices from six to five, effective upon the next vacancy in the Court.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his presidency, Obama supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for many immigrants illegally residing in the United States. However, Congress did not pass a comprehensive immigration bill during Obama's tenure, and Obama turned to executive actions. In the 2010 <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session,</b> Obama supported passage of the DREAM Act, which passed the House but failed to overcome a Senate filibuster in a 55-41 vote in favor of the bill. In 2013, the Senate passed an immigration bill with a path to citizenship, but the House did not vote on the bill. In 2012, Obama implemented the DACA policy, which protected roughly 700,000 illegal immigrants from deportation; the policy applies only to those who were brought to the United States before their 16th birthday. In 2014, Obama announced a new executive order that would have protected another four million illegal immigrants from deportation, but the order was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 4-4 tie vote that upheld a lower court's ruling. Despite executive actions to protect some individuals, deportations of illegal immigrants continued under Obama. A record high of 400,000 deportations occurred in 2012, though the number of deportations fell during Obama's second term. In continuation of a trend that began {{with the passage of the}} Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the percentage of foreign-born people living in the United States reached 13.7% in 2015, higher than at any point since the early 20th century. After having risen since 1990, the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States stabilized at around 11.5 million individuals during Obama's presidency, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{was sworn}} in as a senator on January 3, 2005, {{becoming}} the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus. CQ Weekly characterized him as a [...] "loyal Democrat" [...] based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, {{before the start of the}} <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session,</b> to focus on his transition period for the presidency.|$|E
500|$|After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging {{perjury and}} {{obstruction}} of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky. After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed [...] "substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment", the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> in December 1998.|$|E
500|$|After the Federalists {{lost control}} of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the {{election}} of 1800, the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, {{commonly known as the}} Midnight Judges Act, which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the [...] "Midnight Judges" [...] the appointments were issued just days before his presidential term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the [...] 7th Congress, with a solid [...] Democratic-Republican majority, approved the Judiciary Act of 1802, abolishing the newly created courts.|$|E
500|$|Anticipating an {{increase}} in Democratic membership in the following Congress, Republicans used the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the 40th United States Congress to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage. Representative John Bingham, the primary author of the Fourteenth Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a broader proposal banning voter restriction {{on the basis of}} [...] "race, color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs" [...] was rejected. A proposal to specifically ban literacy tests was also rejected. Some Representatives from the North, where nativism was a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to foreign-born citizens, as did Representatives from the West, where ethnic Chinese were banned from voting. Both Southern and Northern Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote temporarily to Southerners disfranchised for support of the Confederacy, and they were concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would enfranchise this group.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by a deranged office seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system and, by 1882, a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination. [...] In his first annual presidential address to Congress in 1881, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation and Pendleton again introduced his bill, but Congress did not pass it. [...] Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue. [...] As a result, the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of Congress was more amenable to civil service reform; the Senate approved Pendleton's bill 38–5 and the House soon concurred {{by a vote of}} 155–47. [...] Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16, 1883. [...] In just two years' time, an unrepentant Stalwart had become the president who ushered in long-awaited civil service reform.|$|E
500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I resent it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, {{before the}} January 2011 {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as governor, David Paterson reached out {{to members of the}} New York State Senate in an attempt to gauge support for the passage of same-sex marriage legislation during a <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the Legislature; however, the governor {{came to the conclusion that}} passage of the bill during the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> was not feasible. When asked what would have to occur in order for same-sex marriage to be legalized in New York, Governor Paterson responded, [...] "Get rid of the lobbyists", and added that same-sex marriage advocates had forced a Senate floor vote prematurely in December 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Schumer {{voted on}} the {{impeachment}} charges of President Bill Clinton {{in both houses}} of Congress. Schumer {{was a member of the}} House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of Congress, voting [...] "no" [...] on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House. In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted [...] "not guilty" [...] on the two impeachment charges.|$|E
50|$|In January 1801, {{during his}} <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session,</b> John Adams {{nominated}} Lucius Horatio Stockton to be Secretary of War. Stockton withdrew himself from consideration.|$|E
50|$|During the 1932-33 <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of Congress, Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden twice {{introduced}} impeachment resolutions against President Herbert Hoover. The resolutions were tabled by wide margins.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of Congress in the United States occurs {{whenever}} one Congress meets {{after its}} successor is elected, {{but before the}} successor's term begins. The expression is now used not only for a special session called after a sine die adjournment, but also for any portion of a regular session that falls after an election. In current practice, any meeting of Congress after election day, but before the next Congress convenes the following January, is a <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session.</b> Prior to 1933, when the 20th Amendment changed the dates of the congressional term, the last regular session of Congress was always a lame duck session.|$|E

50|$|Koehler {{opposed the}} $8,000 a year pay raise that the {{legislature}} voted to give itself in a <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> in 1978, and returned $8,000 of her pay to the state treasury every year she was in office, returning a total of $48,000 over her 6 years in office.|$|E

50|$|He was re-elected {{three times}} serving from March 4, 1883, but after his {{re-election}} in 1888 had a nervous breakdown, complicated by insomnia; as a result, {{he never took}} his seat in the <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> of the Fiftieth Congress and had no chance to attend the Congress that followed it. He died on August 17, 1889 in Hastings, aged 40. Laird is buried in Hastings' Parkview Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|Instead, when a Congress {{has decided}} to {{continue}} meeting after an election, its usual practice has been not to adjourn sine die, but simply to recess its existing session for a period spanning the election, and then to reconvene at a date still within the constitutional term of the sitting Congress. Since 1935, this second means of bringing about a <b>lame-duck</b> <b>session</b> has been used on 11 occasions.|$|E
