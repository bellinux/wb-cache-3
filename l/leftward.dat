5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further <b>leftward</b> and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that <b>leftward</b> deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|After the Labour Party was {{defeated}} at the 2010 general election, Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party; in September 2010, Miliband {{was elected to}} replace him. His tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a <b>leftward</b> shift in his party's policies, and by opposition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's cuts to the public sector. He led his party into several elections, including the 2014 European Parliament election. Following Labour's defeat by the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, Miliband announced his resignation as leader on 8 May 2015. He was succeeded in the ensuing leadership election by Jeremy Corbyn.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's <b>leftward</b> leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent <b>leftward</b> bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{system that}} caused the tornado had {{produced}} severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a warm front near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center. It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn {{to the right of the}} mean flow. It is unknown whether this <b>leftward</b> movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a <b>leftward</b> drift in 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This <b>leftward</b> lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} <b>leftward</b> {{steering}} necessary {{to balance the}} <b>leftward</b> lean appropriate for the forward speed and radius of the turn {{is controlled by the}} torque generated by the rider, again either at the seat or in the torso.|$|E
25|$|When {{preceded by}} another ট ṭô, ট {{is reduced to}} a <b>leftward</b> curl: ট্ট ṭṭô.|$|E
25|$|Harmon squibbed {{the kick}} and Cal's Kevin Moen {{received}} the ball inside the Cal 45 near the left hash mark. After some ineffective scrambling, Moen lateraled the ball <b>leftward</b> to Richard Rodgers.|$|E
25|$|This countersteering to {{the right}} causes the ground contact to move {{to the right}} of the center of mass, as the bike moves forward, thus {{generating}} a <b>leftward</b> lean. Finally the front end steers to the left and the bike enters the left turn.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, spurred {{in part by}} the {{increasingly}} <b>leftward</b> tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The Greensboro Sit-ins {{played a crucial role in}} the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leftward</b> {{transcription}} {{expresses the}} gam, red, xis, and int genes. Gam and red proteins {{are involved in}} recombination. Gam is also important in that it inhibits the host RecBCD nuclease from degrading the 3’ ends in rolling circle replication. Int and xis are integration and excision proteins vital to lysogeny.|$|E
25|$|To {{straighten}} {{back out}} of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel contact patches farther to the left, eventually reducing the <b>leftward</b> lean and exiting the turn.|$|E
25|$|Writing for CNN, senior {{producer}} Edward Mejia Davis {{compared the}} book to a similar effort by Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First: How We Can All Change America, put out during their 1992 campaign. Davis concluded that the comparison revealed a <b>leftward</b> drift in the Democratic Party of the United States during the intervening 24 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{supply and}} demand {{economic}} model suggests that any tax raises the cost of transaction for someone, {{whether it is the}} seller or purchaser. In raising the cost, either the demand curve shifts <b>leftward,</b> or the supply curve shifts upward. The two are functionally equivalent. Consequently, the quantity of a good purchased decreases, and/or the price for which it is sold increases.|$|E
25|$|The four {{compartments}} in {{the lower}} left of the skull depict a choice Kurelek had to make, between the outside world (the left most panel) and the hospital (the other three.) The test tube compartment depicts Kurelek's view of himself analyzed by the doctors, but the two <b>leftward</b> compartments represent two differing interpretations of that analysis: a benevolent conspiracy (below) and a malevolent persecution (above).|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Peled {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (ICIPP), {{together}} with Uri Avnery, the late Yaakov Arnon, Yossi Amitai, Amos Keinan, Aryeh Eliav and others. Aside from Avnery (a journalist and Knesset member who had confronted the Israeli establishment since the early 1950s) most founders of the ICIPP—like Peled himself—were dissident members of the establishment who had moved <b>leftward</b> in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, he started {{regularly}} publishing {{articles in the}} weekend edition of Maariv, in which the clear <b>leftward</b> change in his political stance was evident. He also joined the Israeli Labor Party, though holding no office on its behalf, and in the 1973 elections was {{among a group of}} prominent doves who called upon voters to vote for Labor, despite its faults, rather than for the more radical small left-wing parties (which, under Israel's system of proportional representation had a good chance of gaining some seats in the Knesset).|$|E
25|$|August 21, 2001 - At 01:11, an America West Airlines Boeing 737-300 {{operating}} as Flight 598 from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport touched down on Runway 27 {{to the left}} of the center line during severe weather. The first officer in command failed to correct for <b>leftward</b> drift and the aircraft exited the runway approximately 1,000 feet after touchdown. Both engines were destroyed by foreign object debris, but the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. No fatalities and only one injury were reported by the 53 passengers and 6 crew.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was also}} close to Arnold Petersen (1885–1976), the Danish-born {{successor}} to Daniel DeLeon's mantle as top {{leader of the}} Socialist Labor Party. In 1918, Johnson became editor of the SLP's official newspaper, The Weekly People, replacing Edmund Seidel, who had begun advocating a merger with the <b>leftward</b> tilting Socialist Party of America. She remained in that position for 20 years, also writing many articles and pamphlets {{on behalf of the}} party. A number of Johnson's pamphlets were translated into Swedish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, and Croatian by the various foreign language federations of the SLP.|$|E
25|$|Polarization is {{a general}} {{property}} of waves that describes {{the orientation of the}}ir oscillations. For transverse waves such as many electromagnetic waves, it describes the orientation of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. The oscillations may be oriented in a single direction (linear polarization), or the oscillation direction may rotate as the wave travels (circular or elliptical polarization). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or <b>leftward</b> in the direction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a wave is called the wave's chirality.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the <b>leftward</b> horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|Since the physicist's {{concept of}} force has a {{direction}} and a magnitude, {{it may be}} seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force F of 15 newtons. If the positive axis is also directed rightward, then F is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points <b>leftward,</b> then the vector for F is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δs of 4 meters would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.|$|E
25|$|Many {{conservative}} Southern Democrats {{defected to}} the Republican Party, {{beginning with the}} passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the general <b>leftward</b> shift of the party. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, Kent Hance and Ralph Hall of Texas, and Richard Shelby of Alabama are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason for the GOP's shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.|$|E
25|$|After {{his first}} visit to Beijing in 1956, Sukarno began to {{strengthen}} his ties to the People's Republic of China and the communist bloc in general. He also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet bloc military aid. By the early 1960s, the Soviet bloc provided more aid to Indonesia than to any other non-communist country, while Soviet military aid to Indonesia was equalled only by its aid to Cuba. This large influx of communist aid prompted an increase in military aid from the Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy Administrations, which worried about a <b>leftward</b> drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet bloc aid.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party favors {{raising the}} minimum wage and {{believes}} that all Americans {{have the right to}} a fair wage. They call for a $10.10/hour national minimum wage and think {{the minimum wage}} should be adjusted regularly. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed. In May 2017, senate Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024, and marks a <b>leftward</b> turn in Democratic economic policies.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} term of his mayoralty, Johnson was {{perceived}} as having moved <b>leftward</b> on certain issues, for instance by supporting the London Living Wage {{and the idea of}} an amnesty for illegal migrants. He tried placating critics who had deemed him a bigot by appearing at London's gay pride parade and praising ethnic minority newspapers. In 2012, he banned London buses from displaying the adverts of Core Issues Trust, a Christian group, which compared being gay to an illness. In August 2008, Johnson broke from the traditional protocol of those in public office not publicly commenting on other nations' elections by endorsing Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States.|$|E
25|$|In a 1976 {{published}} essay, the psychiatrists Colin Martindale, Nancy Hasenfus, and Dwight Hines (University of Maine) {{suggested that}} Hitler had {{suffered from a}} sub-function of the left hemisphere of the brain. They referred to the tremor of his left limbs, his tendency for <b>leftward</b> eye movements and the alleged missing of the left testicle. They believed that Hitler’s behavior was dominated by his right cerebral hemisphere, a situation that resulted in symptoms such as a tendency to the irrational, auditory hallucinations, and uncontrolled outbursts. Martindale, Hasenfus and Hines even suspected that {{the dominance of the}} right hemisphere contributed to the two basic elements of Hitlers political ideology: antisemitism and Lebensraum ideology.|$|E
25|$|A needle, LCD {{or regular}} LED type tuner uses a {{microprocessor}} {{to measure the}} average period of the waveform. It uses that information to drive the needle or array of lights. When the musician plays a single note, the tuner senses the pitch. The tuner then displays the pitch {{in relation to the}} desired pitch, and indicates whether the input pitch is lower, higher, or equal to the desired pitch. With needle displays, the note is in tune when the needle is in a 90° vertical position, with <b>leftward</b> or rightward deviations indicating that the note is flat or sharp, respectively. Tuners with a needle are often supplied with a backlight, so that the display can be read on a darkened stage.|$|E
25|$|Two-thirds of Honduras {{citizens}} live {{below the}} poverty line, and unemployment is estimated at 28%. It has one of Latin America's most unequal distributions of wealth: the poorest 10% of the population receives just 1.2% of the country's wealth, while the richest 10% collect 42%. Approximately twenty per cent of the nation's GDP comes from remittances of workers from abroad. The BBC describe the huge wealth gap in a poor country as {{one of the reasons why}} the relations between the president and the other institutions were so strained and that his <b>leftward</b> movement alarmed certain sectors. Zelaya pushed for a referendum, insisting that Honduras' grinding poverty stemmed from a constitution – written in 1982 at the height of that country's brutal repression of leftists – that rigs the game for the most powerful families and interests.|$|E
25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, a depressing atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort to keep them out of the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a <b>leftward</b> course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the revolutionary left.|$|E
25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and <b>leftward.</b> The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|E
25|$|Most {{historians and}} medical experts {{now believe that}} Garfield {{probably}} would have survived his wound had the doctors attending him been more capable. Unfortunately for Garfield, most American doctors of the day {{did not believe in}} anti-sepsis measures or the need for cleanliness to prevent infection. Several inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, and one doctor punctured Garfield's liver in doing so. Also, self-appointed chief physician D. Willard Bliss had supplanted Garfield's usual physician, Jedediah Hyde Baxter. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in Garfield's body. They had erroneously probed rightward into Garfield's back instead of <b>leftward,</b> missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy not only discovered this error but revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled septicemia.|$|E
25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli <b>leftward</b> of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect {{the left side of}} the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly neglect {{the left side of the}} barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
