For all d ≥ 1 and r∈(0,∞) we establish mean and variance asymptotics as well as central limit theorems for the rth power quantization error. <b>Limiting</b> <b>means</b> and variances are {{expressed in terms of}} the densities of P and X 1. Similar convergence results hold for the random point measures arising by placing at each X i, 1 ≤ i≤n, a mass equal to the local distortion. 1 Introduction and main results Quantization for probability measures is a classic partitioning problem arising in information theory, cluster analysis, and mathematical models in economics[7]. It concerns the best approximation of a d-dimensional probability measure P by a discrete measure supported by a set � having n atoms.

Occurrence of the disease increases together with population ageing. The theoretical part of the thesis is aimed at the disease characteristics, care of clients, communication, advisory activities, communication and activation supporting methods for people suffering from Alzheimers disease. It also deals with the issues of protection of rights, <b>limiting</b> <b>means</b> and ability to perform legal acts. The aim of the thesis was {{to find out how}} health-social services to people suffering from Alzheimers disease are fulfilled {{from the point of view}} of the staff working with this group of people. The research was performed at Home for Seniors Máj p. o. and Prácheňské sanatorium o. p. s. [...] Loucký mlýn. Qualitative research strategy and the questioning method of semi structured interview technique were used for data collection. The thesis aim was fulfilled within the responses of the staff to partial research questions.

Results the paper proposes a definition of prohibition as a state socio volitional constraining <b>limiting</b> <b>means</b> that under the threat of legal liability is intended to prevent the wrongful act of the subject physical or legal entity and ensure the maintenance of law and order. Prohibition is a necessary means of ensuring the discipline of public relations and the consolidation of legal values designed to assure the effectiveness of legal regulation. 	Scientific novelty for the first time the article shows that prohibition as a legal category is the ontological basis of legal reality and acts as a determining factor in the content and focus not only of lawmaking and law enforcement but legal behavior as well. 	Practical significance the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in research and teaching when considering questions about the nature content and functioning of prohibitions...|$|E
40|$|This Diploma Work is {{focussed}} {{on application}} of restrictive agents with {{patients who are}} afflicted with violent and aggressive behaviour. The up-to-date civilization has brought, expect for further changes, also a very principal change that presents a substantial increase of psychic and psychiatric disorders. That {{is why it is}} necessary to think about the question how to prevent aggression and violence in medical facilities. It is evidenced that more cases of patients showing aggressive and violent behaviour occur nowadays. What are preventive news in occurrence of aggression while hospitalization? What are legal news and standards applied to limiting and restrictive means? It is not a rule any more that we meet a patient with aggressive or violent behaviour only in psychiatric departments. However, we can meet those patients in any departments and facilities of healthcare. The Diploma Work is split into a theoretical and a practical section. In the theoretic part we state the human psyche evolution, aggression and violence origination and evolution, kinds of aggression, violent behaviour and demographic occurrence thereof within existing population. Further on, we mention kinds of restrictive measures, their indications and the statutory framework dealing with this problem area. A status of nurse and a nurse competence in that area represent an important element of the theoretic work. Four objectives were set in the practical part of the Work. The first goal was aimed to find out work fastidiousness of nurse providing care to patients with aggressive and violent behaviour. The second goal had to recognise what was taken for the greatest problem area within nursing care at treatment of patients with aggressive and violent behaviour. The third goal was to find out any benefits and shortages in the application of restrictive agents at treatment of patients with aggressive and violent behaviour. Finally, the fourth goal was set to find out and compare nursing staff?s opinions on the application of restrictive agents and main problems in that field. The above objectives were met. Based on those objectives research questions were defined. What is the work fastidiousness of nurses who take care of patients with violent and aggressive behaviour? What is considered by the nurses as the most problem area within providing healthcare to aggressive patients? What is the positive application of restrictive agents with patients showing aggressive or violent behaviour? What special reform should be performed in the application of restrictive - <b>limiting</b> <b>means?</b> The asked questions were answered. A qualitative investigation was used to work out the Diploma Work. Collection of needed data was carried out by help of procedure of a non-standardized, structured dialogue. Our investigation took place in the psychiatric department of Klatovy Hospital a. s., the psychiatric department of University Hospital in Plzeň, Psychiatric Medical Institution in Dobřany and other more departments. The nurses? answers were compiled in casuistries from which though maps were made up. The described investigation was running from January to July 2011. The results of my Diploma Work might serve as a feedback for the hospitals and medical institutions in which the above investigation was performed. An educative programme for nurses was created...|$|E

The algorithms of concern are tailored {{to reflect the}} behavior of TCP congestion avoidance, in particular, the response to multiple congestion indications within a single round-trip time. We derive the <b>limit</b> <b>mean</b> ordinary differential equation (ODE) for each algorithm, which solution yields the limit throughput distribution. We focus on {{the fairness of the}} throughput distribution and bias against long round-trip time connections. The modeling by the ODE method is justified for an asymptotically small adaptation of the rate process, which corresponds to small additive-increase and multiplicative-decrease parameters. We verify, through numerical simulation, how well the <b>limit</b> <b>mean</b> ODE result matches the behavior of the system with a realistic non-asymptotic setting.
