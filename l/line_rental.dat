500|$|The Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} a state-aid road law in 1903, {{but the law}} was repealed in 1905. Instead, the driving force {{for the construction of}} what became the Delaware portion of US 113 was Thomas Coleman DuPont, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure. Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main north–south highway as the backbone of a well-laid-out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a [...] right-of-way that contained a [...] high-speed automobile highway flanked by dual trolley tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at {{the outer edge of the}} right-of-way.

5000|$|By 2000, {{virtually}} all major airlines, hotel firms, cruise <b>lines</b> and <b>rental</b> car firms had implemented revenue management systems to predict customer demand and optimize available price. These revenue management systems had limited [...] "optimize" [...] to imply managing {{the availability of}} pre-defined prices in pre-established price categories. The objective function was to select the best blends of predicted demand given existing prices. The sophisticated technology and optimization algorithms had been focused on selling {{the right amount of}} inventory at a given price, not on the price itself. Realizing that controlling inventory was no longer sufficient, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) launched an initiative to better understand the price sensitivity of customer demand. IHG determined that calculating price elasticity at very granular levels to a high degree of accuracy still was not enough. Rate transparency had elevated the importance of incorporating market positioning against substitutable alternatives. IHG recognized that when a competitor changes its rate, the consumer's perception of IHG's rate also changes. Working with third party competitive data, the IHG team was able to analyze historical price, volume and share data to accurately measure price elasticity in every local market for multiple lengths of stay. These elements were incorporated into a system that also measured differences in customer elasticity based upon how far in advance the booking is being made relative to the arrival date. The incremental revenue from the system was significant as this new Price Optimization capability increased Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) by 2.7%. IHG and Revenue Analytics, a pricing and revenue management consulting firm, were selected as finalists for the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences for their joint effort in implementing Price Optimization at IHG.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, the Elián González {{affair was}} an {{immigration}} {{battle in the}} Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Elián González who was rescued from the waters {{off the coast of}} Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father Juan Miguel González, his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Elián by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise <b>lines,</b> hotels, car <b>rental</b> companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Elián González returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000.|$|R
40|$|Executive summary In 2014, the 50 % of {{median income}} poverty {{line for a}} single adult was $ 426. 30 a week (or $ 343. 00 for income after housing costs). For a couple with {{children}} it was $ 895. 22 a week (or $ 720. 22 after housing). Using the after-housing poverty line, the headline poverty rate in 2014 is 13. 3 %, slightly lower than the 2012 rate (13. 9 %). Longerm analysis indicates an overall trend of persistent and entrenched poverty over the decade. Of most concern, there was a 2 % increase in child poverty from 2004 to 2014, with the trend most pronounced for children in lone parent families. In international perspective, Australia’s poverty rate remains above the OECD average, despite our relative prosperity. In population terms, there were 2. 99 million people living {{below the poverty line}} after taking account of housing costs in 2014. The poverty rate for children remained significantly higher than for adults at 17. 4 %, affecting 731, 000 children. This was little changed from 2012 when the child poverty rate was 17. 7 %. Of concern, the child poverty rate for children in lone parent families increased from 36. 8 % in 2012 to 40. 6 % in 2014. By family type, lone parents experience the highest poverty rates at 33. 2 % and this has been a consistent trend throughout the decade. The rate of poverty for lone parents has increased since 2012, a year in which 80, 000 sole parents were moved from pension to (much lower) allowance payments. Children in lone families are more than {{three times more likely to}} be living in poverty than their counterparts in couple families, with a poverty rate of 40. 6 % compared to 12. 5 %. The majority of people below the poverty line relied on social security as their main source of income (57. 3 %), but a significant proportion received wages as their main income (32 %). This division has not changed significantly from the previous reports, with wage earners comprising about a third of those in poverty in 2010 (29 %) and 2012 (33 %). While an overall minority of people receiving social security payments fell under the poverty line in 2014 (36. 1 %), a majority of Newstart (55 %) and Parenting Payment (51. 5 %) recipients were in this category. A number of social security payments fell significantly below the poverty line, including most notably the unemployment payment. For a single person with no children, Newstart in 2013 - 14 fell $ 109. 55 per week below the poverty line. Youth Allowance was even further below: for a single person with no children it fell $ 158. 63 per week below the poverty line. These figures take Rent Assistance into account, so the gaps were even higher for households not eligible for this supplementary payment. Unemployed households experienced poverty at the highest rate of all the population groups analysed at 63. 2 %, a 2 % increase since 2012. People of working age not in the labour force had a poverty rate of 43. 9 % and lone parent families 33. 2 %. Analysis by housing tenure shows that the vast majority of people below the poverty <b>line</b> were in <b>rental</b> housing in 2014 (59. 7 %), with most in private rental housing (44. 2 %) compared with 11. 4 % in public. Only 15. 5 % of people living below the poverty line were homeowners, with a slightly higher proportion being mortgagees than outright owners...|$|R
