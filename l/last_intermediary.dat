Through Kapitein Beng Kong, then, the Batavian Captaincy succeeded the much-earlier institution of Kapitan Cina of Bantam.

Intermediary market for innovation is mostly prevailing in a few advanced countries even though various technologies are distributed globally.

This study is an effort towards building theories and models for intermediary market. Peer reviewe...|$|R
