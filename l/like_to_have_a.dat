After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E
5|$|The story {{describes}} the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood, a wealthy spinster, and Oliver Carleton, a rake who cares little for society's opinion of him. The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality {{is similar to that}} of many of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel; his primary change was to accept that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife.|$|E

Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant {{that he was able to}} build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{one might}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> direct {{definition}} of the cotangent space {{without reference to the}} tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x if they have the same first-order behavior near x, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behaviour near x if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.|$|E

500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature.

I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band {{to tie in}} with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was {{not sure if it}} would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" [...] by Motörhead, [...] "The Metal" [...] by Tenacious D, and [...] "More Than Meets The Eye" [...] by Testament—to appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legends release.|$|E

[...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
40|$|The paper takes {{issue with}} Perry’s defense of physicalism against the thread posed by the so called {{knowledge}} argument (“Mary’s case”). His defense {{is based on a}} distinction between the “subject matter content ” and the “re-flexive content ” of knowledge-states. It is argued that, while this distinction can illuminate many cases of newly acquired knowledge, its application to Mary’s case presupposes that knowledge of what it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ex-perience E is a case of factual, propositional knowledge. In arguing for this presupposition Perry needs to reject the Ability Hypothesis (Lewis and Nemirow), according to which knowledge of what it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ex-perience E is an instance of knowing-how as opposed to knowing-that. The paper claims that Perry’s argument for generally subsuming knowing-how under knowing-that fails.

30|$|Activation, {{as noted}} above, {{is a tricky}} concept to define and measure since it {{involves}} the institutions responsible for delivering employment services, the payment of UI and related welfare benefits, the rules for monitoring and controlling the behaviour of benefit recipients as they search for work and how these rules are implemented in practice.

500|$|Strindberg wooed Bosse {{by sending}} her books about {{theosophy}} and the occult, {{by attempting to}} mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. [...] Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in Easter (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, {{turned out to be}} Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands on my shoulders, looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} what it felt <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles {{to the back of}} the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E
