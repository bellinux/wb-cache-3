40|$|Background: Distalisation of {{the upper}} molars {{can be used to}} treat a dental Class II deep bite {{malocclusion}} with a flat facial profile. It is a useful procedure when extraction treatment has been refused and providing distalisation is an appropriate solution to the patient’s problem. Aims: To describe distalisation {{of the upper}} buccal segments using a modified distal jet appliance and miniscrew. Methods: Two case reports are presented. The first case was treated with a distal screw appliance: a modified distal jet appliance with a palatal miniscrew and without the premolar arms. The Nance button was anchored to the palatal bone by a miniscrew inserted through a posterior <b>locating</b> plate. <b>Locating</b> <b>holes</b> in the plate ensured that the miniscrew was inserted into a site with optimal bone in the posterior part of the palate. The second case was treated with a similar distal screw appliance, but in this case the locating plate was embedded in the acrylic button. The miniscrew was inserted through a prepared hole in the button and plate. The <b>locating</b> <b>hole(s)</b> ensured that a screw could be inserted into an optimal site {{to one side of the}} median palatal suture. Conclusions: The distal screw appliance can be used to distalise upper teeth with minimal or no anchorage loss...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for application of stress results from three dimensional {{finite element models}} for use in fracture mechanics computations. It {{is based on the}} assumption that a fatigue crack propagates in a plane normal to the maximum principal stress in a region that can be idealized as a rectangular plate. The methodology, recently implemented in the DARWIN ® probabilistic fracture mechanics program, is demonstrated for (1) a finite width plate with a centrally <b>located</b> <b>hole</b> and (2) an aircraft gas turbine engine rotor disk. Computational error associated with the methodology is less than 1 % compared to analytical and finite element solutions.

The specimens were loaded in either tension or compression, and onset damage, ultimate strengths, and corresponding failure modes were determined. The tension data showed the expected linear interaction for combined bearing-bypass loading with damage developing in the net-section tension mode. However, the bearing-onset strengths showed an unexpected {{interaction of the}} bearing and compressive bypass loads in which the latter reduced the bearing-onset strength.

An integration optimization model of {{tolerance and}} maintenance for multi-station sheet metal assembly was presented in this work. Based on the variation propagation state space model, a quality loss model of multi-station assembly processes was built. This model considered the effect of process loss.

The nonlinear tolerance optimization of <b>locating</b> <b>holes</b> (slots) in multi-station sheet metal assembly was achieved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} and test results for an algorithm solving constrained black box optimization problems globally using mainly methods from data analysis. A particular focus is put on constraints: in addition to bound constraints, we also handle black box inequality and equality constraints. In particular, our algorithm is able to handle equality constraints given in implicit form f(x) = 0 where f is a black box function and x a vector {{of one or more}} variables. We achieve this by approximating our black box functions by quadratic covariance models, using Gaussian mixture models to <b>locate</b> <b>holes</b> to ll with sample points and bounding implicit equality constraints by quadratic approximations. Our algorithm does not require gradients or gradient approximations, making it t for problems where function evaluations are expensive and no derivative information is available...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This study {{presented}} an {{experimental study of}} the behavior of woven glass fiber/epoxy with ply orientation (+ 45 º/- 45 º/+ 45 º) s composite laminated panels under compression. Compression tests were performed on to eighteen fiber-glass laminated plates with and without different shapes of cut-outs using the compressed machine. The maximum load of failure for each of the laminated plates under compression has been determined experimentally. A parametric study was performed as well to investigate the effects of varying the centrally <b>located</b> <b>holes</b> and notches cut-out. These results indicated that a cut-out can {{have a significant effect on}} buckling, fracture and energy absorption response of a compression-loaded panel. The results indicated that the plates without cut-out exhibited higher fracture load and energy absorption than plates with cut-out.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is developed analytically {{to design and}} produce an optimized stiffened panel with a centrally <b>located</b> <b>hole.</b> The PASCO panel-buckling analysis and sizing code is employed with the Engineering Analysis Language (EAL) code for finite-element analysis to optimize the design variables. Important design considerations are stiffener height and ply thicknesses in the skin and the stiffener laminates. The EAL code calculates the maximum strains around the hole boundary, and the resulting constraints are combined with the buckling constraint developed by the PASCO code. Cooptimization of the two codes is effected until convergence on the optimal solution is achieved. Results of the analytical procedure are experimentally verified by applying a compressive end-load to graphite-fiber laminated plates with center holes.

40|$|The {{response}} of brittle materials to dynamic loads was studied {{in this investigation}} based on a continuum damage model. Damage mechanism was selected to be interaction and growth of subscale cracks. Briefly, the cracks are activated by bulk tension and the density of activated cracks are described by a Weibull statistical distribution. The moduli of a cracked solid derived by Budiansky and O`Connell are then used to represent the global material degradation due to subscale cracking. This continuum damage model was originally developed to study rock fragmentation and was modified {{in the present study}} to improve on the post-limit structural response.
