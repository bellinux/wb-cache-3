She criticised the government over the Winterborne View care home abuse scandal, calling for an investigation into the affair.

40|$|In the UK’s {{austerity}} regime, {{government spending}} has been slashed, while audit regimes tie up officers of charitable organisations in bureaucracy rather than leaving them free {{to attend to}} the substance of their jobs. These funding-cuts-masquerading-as-market-based-restructuring have drastically affected the provision of advice to welfare dependents. But advisers, and the organisations they work for, piece together new patchworks of funds, devise new forms of face-to-face advice, and rework the boundaries of the law. <b>Local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>funds</b> are invested to yield returns from centrally-funded sources. People are helped to honour their tax commitments while challenging debts incurred from the incorrect award and reclaim of benefits, and to pay their council tax and rent. For advisers, austerity is more a matter of seeking new resource flows, inventing novel interventions, and creating new spaces where justice may be sought and found, than of passively accepting funding cuts. En el Reino Unido, las políticas de recortes de fondos maquilladas como restructuraciones basadas en el mercado han afectado drásticamente la provisión a los dependientes de la asistencia social. Pero los asesores y las organizaciones para las que trabajan forman nuevos tejidos de fondos financieros, ingenian nuevas formas de ayudar en persona y reconfiguran los límites de la ley. Los fondos financieros de los gobiernos locales se invierten para obtener réditos de fuentes de financiación centralizada. Se ayuda a la gente a cumplir con sus obligaciones fiscales y, al mismo tiempo, a recortar las deudas generadas por una incorrecta concesión y reclamación de prestaciones, y a pagar sus tasas municipales y sus alquileres. Para los asesores, la austeridad es una cuestión de buscar nuevos flujos de recursos, idear nuevas formas de intervención y crear nuevos espacios en los que la justicia pueda ser buscada y hallada.

40|$|Financial {{position}} of <b>Local</b> <b>authorities</b> (LAs) has been considerably strengthened {{in the past}} ten years {{as a result of the}} transfers made through the <b>Local</b> <b>Authority</b> Transfer <b>Fund</b> (LATF). However in almost all LAs, there is a huge gap between the formally approved budget and what actually happens. This is mainly because revenues are forecast unrealistically, in order to show a balanced budget and most of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> are faced with financial problems due to failure to make realistic budgets, lack of control and poor financial management practice. This study focused on the factors affecting financial management systems of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> in Kenya. The specific purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of budget preparation process on financial management systems in <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> to establish the effect of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>funding</b> on the financial management systems in <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> to identify the effect of management practices on the financial management systems in <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> and to establish the effect of employee capacity on the financial systems in <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> The study will assist the management to realize the importance of proper financial management and create awareness among the stakeholders on the services provided and the best and efficient management practice of giving out the services. It was based on the south eastern counties with a greater emphasis on the municipal councils in the region. The study used descriptive design where by a survey method was applied. The study used stratified and purposive technique to sample the target population of 75, who are the management of the councils in the South Eastern Region. Questionnaires were prepared and face to face interviews contacted by the researcher from a sample size of 30 respondents. The data collected was analyzed using percentages and presented in tabular and pie-chart forms. It was found that budget preparation, <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>funding,</b> management practices and employee capacity had a great effect on the management of finances in <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> in Kenya.

50|$|It is feared many <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> {{services}} will close or be cut {{because the government}} has not increased <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>funding</b> in 2017-2018. Gary Porter of the Local Government Association fears authorities will have to cut back on collecting waste, filling potholes, maintaining parks, running children's centres and libraries due to increasing funding shortfalls. Porter said, “Councils, the NHS, charities and care providers remain united around the desperate need for new government funding for social care. By continuing to ignore these warnings, social care remains in crisis and councils and the NHS continue to be pushed to the financial brink.” Children at risk get inadequate help because councils are under resourced. What help children at risk get depends on the postcode lottery and varies between <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|R
