40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new scheme for on-demand {{allocation}} of <b>global</b> IP <b>addresses</b> to hosts of an autonomous network. Such ascheme {{is needed in}} order to overcome the problem of IP address exhaustion. According to the new scheme, each host of the autonomous network is assigned a fixed local address which appears in the source field of all the IP datagrams the host sends and in the destination field of all the IP datagrams it receives. A host that needs an IP-level connectivity with external hosts is allocated a <b>global</b> <b>address</b> for a limited time. Such a host continues using its fixed local address as the source field of every sent datagram. However, if the datagram is destined for an external host, the autonomous network border gateway swaps the fixed local address of the source with the leased global one. When an external host sends a datagram to a local host, it uses the <b>global</b> <b>address</b> of the local host as destination address. When the datagram enters the autonomous network, the leased <b>global</b> <b>address</b> is swapped by the fixed local one. As the paper shows, the proposed scheme that employs IP address swapping has several important advantages. Most of these advantages are {{due to the fact that}} the leased <b>global</b> <b>addresses</b> are not visible to the internal routing gateways, and that local hosts always use a single local address...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>global</b> <b>address</b> space (GAS) {{programming}} model provides important potential productivity {{advantages over}} traditional parallel programming models. Languages using the GAS model currently have insufficient support from existing performance analysis tools, {{due in part}} to their implementation complexity. We have designed the <b>Global</b> <b>Address</b> Space Performance (GASP) tool interface that is flexible enough to support instrumentation of any GAS programming model implementation, while simultaneously allowing existing performance analysis tools to leverage their tool’s infrastructure and quickly add support for programming languages and libraries using the GAS model. To evaluate the effectiveness of this interface, the tracing and profiling overhead of a preliminary Berkeley UPC GASP implementation is measured and found to be within the acceptable range. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{database}} {{design and}} passive {{nature of the}} server both created several weakness. A complete lack of distinction between [...] "header" [...] and [...] "envelope" [...] addressing data meant that now-standard functionality such as Bcc: could not be implemented. Mailing lists were similarly problematic. Also, a single postoffice was limited to 500 mailboxes; a large enterprise would require many postoffices and many MTAs to connect these postoffices. Since scheduling data and address lists were also stored locally in these postoffices, moving schedule and <b>global</b> <b>address</b> book information required yet more, separate agents called Dispatch and Microsoft Schedule+ Distribution Agent. Dispatch would synchronise the various copies of the <b>Global</b> <b>Address</b> List using MSMail 3.x Directory Synchronization Protocol.|$|R

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} some recent parallel computers {{is the fact}} that the underlying transport mechanism behind the currently dominating message passing interfaces is based on a <b>global</b> <b>address</b> space model. By accessing this <b>global</b> <b>address</b> space directly most of the inherent delays for administering message buffers and queues can be avoided. Using this interface we have implemented a user level distributed shared memory layer using the virtual memory protection mechanisms of the operating system. The synchronisation required for maintaining the coherency of the memory is addressed by implementing a distributed shared lock which exploits the remote atomic store operations provided by the Meiko CS- 2. This allows an asynchronous style of pogramming where the load is dynamically distributed over the nodes of a parallel partition...|$|R
