40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} aimed at obtaining {{detailed}} information about the interaction of NaCl salinity and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration in the halophyte S. salsa, which was irrigated with five different salinity levels under ambient and elevated (530 ppm) CO 2. The results show that total soluble sugar concentration was significantly increased by salt-treatments in both <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots, and that the most progressive sugar increments were observed in <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots of S. salsa under the elevated CO 2. The Na concentration in the <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots increased with the increased NaCl concentration, the K accumulation gradually decreaed by increasing salinity levels in <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots. Proline increased in response to salt stress along with incremental NaCl concentration. The GB concentrations of leaves were significantly raised as NaCl levels increased. Electrolyte leakage increased in the leaves of S. salsa grown under NaCl stress. ψs of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots decreased as the NaCl concentration increase, and that elevated CO 2 both had markedly greater effects on ψs of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots.

CMLL knew that Pantera was <b>leaving</b> <b>and</b> nullified the championship change, choosing not to vacate the title rather than recognizing the title change.

Máscara Mágica would later defeat Super Delfin {{to put an end}} to any questions about the lineage of the championship. In 1998 the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was returned to CMLL, making it a tertiary title behind the CMLL and NWA branded world championships.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{variations of}} characteristics of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> vesicles were studied in a Sargassum duplication Bory population from Owase, Mie Prefecture, Japan. Even {{in this small}} population, four morphologically different plants (type 1, 2, 3 and 4) were distinguished by their characteristics of <b>leave</b> <b>and</b> vesicles, as follows. Type 1 had slender oblanceolate <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> entire vesicles, type 2 had broader elliptical <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> apiculated, or crowned or phyllocyst vesicles, type 3 had slender lanceolate <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> variable vesicles, and type 4 had broader elliptical <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> entire or apiculated vesicles, respectively. However, these all plants from Owase showed scutellate holdfasts and slightly compressed primary branches. From the characteristics of holdfast, primary branch and dioecious sexuality, all these plants (type 1 to 4) from Owase should be identified as Sargassum duplicatum Bory having very wide variation ranges of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> vesicles, regardless of few cup-shaped characteristic leaves. Typical S. duplicatum has been usually distinguished its morphology of cup-shaped leaves, vesicles with horn-like appendages and dioecious sexuality in the receptacles. On the other hand, typical S. crassifolium showed the leaves with double seriated margin, phyllocyst-like vesicles, and monoecious sexuality in the receptacles. However, there were some confusing on the morphology of these <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> vesicles, so these two species were now called the member of "S. duplicatum" group including several species (S. cristaefolium, S. turbinatifolium, S, turbinarioides et al.).
