The establishment of Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) has seen the Ethiopian coffee trade system being transformed. It created a platform of primary, secondary and tertiary market divisions.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the carcinogenic and biological actions of N-nitroso compounds arose following the reports of the hepatotoxicity by Freund ' and Barnes and Magee 2 and ofcarcinogenicity (Magee and Barnes) 3 of the simplest nitrosamine: N-nitrosodimethylamine (dimethylnitrosamine) and the subsequent observa-tion of Schoental 4 and Druckrey et aP on the carcin-ogenic action of the nitrosamides: n-methyl N-nitrosourethane and N-methyl N-nitrosurea. Magee and Barnes in 1956 showed the carcinogenic effects of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in rats. Evidence that certain consumer and industrial products contain N-nitroso compounds led to speculation that workers in the industries that either use or manufacture nitrosamine precursors (amines and nitrogen oxides) may be exposed to these agents. ' One such industry is leather tanning. Dimethylamine sulphate (DMAS, a precursor of N-nitrosodimeth-ylamine NDMA) is used in leather tanneries as a depilatory agent in the hide process (P Walker et al, MITRE Corporation report MTR 7152, 1976). Following these observations, Rounbehler et al carried out a study of human exposure to N-nitrosamine by examining work environments of the leather tanneries. 9 Different amounts ofNDMA were detected in air samples taken from different sites in the tannery. The highest levels, up to 47 pg/m 3 were in the retanning, colouring, and fat <b>liquoring</b> area. Fridman et al detected a nitrosamine group attached to various other groups in different samples by using infrared spectroscopy; nitrosamines show an intense band in the infrared region caused by the vibration of the N = 0 bond.
