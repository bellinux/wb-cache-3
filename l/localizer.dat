5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or <b>Localizer</b> (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset <b>localizer</b> approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Software {{failures}} are not {{rare and}} fault localization {{is always an}} important but laborious activity. Since {{there is no guarantee}} that no more than one fault exists in a faulty program, the approach to locate all the faults is necessary. Spectrum-based fault localization techniques collect dynamic program spectra as well as test results of program runs, and estimate the extent of program elements being related to fault(s). A popular solution is to generate a ranked list of suspicious candidates, which are checked in order, stopping whenever a fault is found. Such single-fault <b>localizers</b> locate one fault in one checking round, terminate, and wait to be triggered by the regression testing to validate the fixing of the located fault. In this paper, we study the manifestation of multiple faults in a program and propose an effective mechanism to indicate their presence. When a fault is reached during the checking round, we use it to interpret the failures observed, and update the indicator to judge whether there remain other faults in the program. Our indicator serves as a stopping criterion of checking the ranked list of suspicious candidates.

5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and <b>localizer</b> of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E

25|$|Flight 910 had {{canceled}} its IFR clearance earlier, flying VFR {{during its}} final flight segment, and received landing clearance for Runway 13.

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the PC-24 is {{designed}} for efficiency and to reduce pilot workload.

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} clearance, a non-standard terminology {{was used}} by air-traffic control. As {{he did not have}} authorization to use a <b>localizer</b> back-course approach, the captain should have requested a different approach. Instead, the crew opted to conduct a VOR approach without informing air-traffic control. Neither pilot had carried out instrument approach and landing at runway 07R, making them less familiar with this than their commonly used Runway 25. Another factor was that the SAS aircraft was forced to operate at the lowest-permissible safe speeds while closing in on the Cessna.|$|E

25|$|When the River Visual is not {{available}} due to visibility or winds, aircraft may fly an offset <b>localizer</b> or GPS approach to Runway 19 along a similar course (flying a direct approach course on instruments as far as Rosslyn, and then turning to align with the runway visually moments before touchdown). Most airliners are also capable of performing a VOR or GPS approach to the shorter Runway 15/33. Northbound visual and ILS approaches to Runway 1 are also sometimes used; these approaches follow the Potomac River {{from the south and}} overfly the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the approach procedure by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the <b>localizer</b> at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive rate of descent. The aircraft descended at 2250 ft/min and was 1200 feet above the minimum altitude when overhead the KINNY final approach fix. The Jetstream BA-3100 was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System that was required on larger aircraft.|$|E

He took over for Nintendo's Dan Owsen, who had localized a tenth of the game's script before moving to another project. The game was roughly translated from Japanese by a translator, and Lindblom received a paper script with the translation.

500|$|When Nintendo {{launched}} its digital distribution platform, Virtual Console, for the Wii in 2006, IGN expected EarthBound {{to be among}} Nintendo's highest priorities for rerelease, given the [...] "religious" [...] dedication of its fanbase.

English <b>localizer</b> Marcus Lindblom instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a priority project.
