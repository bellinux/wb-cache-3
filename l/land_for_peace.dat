25|$|Under Tito, Yugoslavia {{adopted a}} policy of nonalignment in the Cold War. It {{developed}} close relations with developing countries (see Non-Aligned Movement) as well as maintaining cordial relations with the United States and Western European countries. Stalin considered Tito a traitor and openly offered condemnation towards him. On 1 January 1967, Yugoslavia was the first communist country to open its borders to all foreign visitors and abolish visa requirements. In the same year Tito became active in promoting a peaceful resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict. His plan called for Arab countries to recognize the State of Israel in exchange for Israel returning territories it had gained. The Arab countries rejected his <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> concept. However, that same year, Yugoslavia no longer recognized Israel.|$|E
25|$|After the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel {{occupied}} Hebron {{along with}} the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.|$|E

She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the North American Free Trade Area.|$|E

He pledged the U.S. Government would [...] "do its part for peace in every forum, at every level, at every hour". On July 12, 1967, Secretary of State Rusk announced that the U.S. position on the Near East crisis was outlined in the President's statement of June 19 and that it {{provided the basis for}} a just and equitable settlement between the Arab states and Israel. On August 16, 1967 the Israeli Foreign Office stated that Israel agreed with the principles set forth by the President on June 19 and indicated that no resolution would be acceptable if it deviated from them.|$|E
2500|$|Schneerson {{publicly}} {{expressed his}} {{view that the}} safety and stability of Israel were {{in the best interests}} of the United States, calling Israel the front line against those who want the anti-Western nations to succeed. He was opposed to <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace,</b> which he called an [...] "illusion of peace", saying that it would not save lives, but harm lives. Schneerson stated that this position was not based on nationalistic or other religious reasons, but purely out of concern for human life. Benjamin Netanyahu said that while serving as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in 1984, Schneerson told him: [...] "you will be serving in a house of darkness, but remember, that even in the darkest place; the light of a single candle can be seen far and wide..." [...] Netanyahu later retold this episode in a speech at the General Assembly, on Sept 23, 2011.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{political violence}} by Palestinian groups against Israel and endeavors {{to determine if}} this political violence was a necessary component of Israel's decision {{to agree to the}} Oslo Accords and subsequent peace process initiative. Through the analysis of four separate time periods in Palestinian history (1948 to The Six Day War, The Six Day War to the Intifada, the Intifada to the Oslo Accords, and post-Oslo Accords) it was shown that three separate forms of political violence were used (guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and civil unrest). When one form of political violence was ended another formed.. Being a democracy, Israel required strong internal support <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> to bring about the peace process. This internal support was created by a demand for personal security and is seen in the creation of new political parties and movements. In short: this thesis demonstrates through argument and evidence that Israelis engaged in a <b>land</b> <b>for</b> security <b>peace</b> deal with the Palestinians primarily because the Palestinians had engaged in political violence...|$|R

2500|$|Tacfarinas raised new {{forces from}} the countryside, but also offered to {{negotiate}} <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace.</b> [...] "The Numidian leader took up arms to force the all-powerful emperor to recognize his people's right to land." [...] The Emperor Tiberius was furious at this no-account commoner, who by offering terms acted like a king. Instead, the Romans offered pardon to rebels who surrendered and also set up counter-insurgency style operations, with many strategic forts and small armed patrols, which checked the rebels for a while. Tiberius, misperceiving the situation, awarded the Roman commander a victory triumph in the year 22. Nonetheless, Tacfarinas renewed the fight as strong as ever. He led the forces of his tribe, together with allies from Numidia and Mauretania, with additional assistance from the Berber Garamentes. Tacfarinas also spread persuasive anti-Roman propanganda. In the year 24, however, following field intelligence, Roman forces surprised the secret camp of Tacfarinas, who died fighting. In the south of Africa Province, smaller-scale Berber insurgencies continued, off and on, hot and cold, for centuries.|$|E

This leads to the self-appointed warriors against online-hatred to link their own homepage to a dubious site named ‘thereligionofpeace.com’.

[...] The website came out against plans to build an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero in New York, and said this was the reason why. [...] "Because Islam is a hateful and violent ideology which preaches hate and violence against ALL non-Muslims (especially Jews, as it is obsessed with us, and dehumanizes us as apes and pigs), we are against ALL mosques. We are against Islam, just as we are against Nazism. Just as we don't wish to see Nazi institutions springing up everywhere, we don't need to see Islamic one's springing up everywhere, either." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> is an {{interpretation}} of UN Security Council Resolution 242 which has {{formed the basis of}} subsequent Arab-Israeli peace making. The name <b>Land</b> <b>for</b> <b>Peace</b> is derived from the wording of the resolution's first operative paragraph which affirms that peace should include the application of two principles: Withdrawal of Israeli forces (Giving Up Land), and Termination of all claims or states of belligerency (Making Peace). Since the resolution stipulates that both principles should apply, they can be viewed jointly as giving up <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>peace,</b> referred to more concisely as 'land for peace'.|$|E

Routledge families were certainly among those who searched <b>for</b> <b>land</b> and <b>peace</b> away from border strife. Numerous baptisms, marriages, and burials are recorded by parish vicars all over southern Britain, albeit with the outlandish spellings typical of the era but nonetheless bearing some proximity to Rutledge or Routledge. Perhaps the earliest available baptismal record is for a Humphrey Rettleg christened in Staffordshire England in 1516.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} flag of Ethiopia (የኢትዮጵያ ሰንደቅ ዓላማ, ye-Ityoppya Sendeq Alama) was adopted on 31 October 1996. It {{conforms to the}} specifications set forth in Article 3 of the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia. However, {{the diameter of the}} central disc is increased from that of the flag used from 6 February to 31 October 1996. The three traditional colours of green, yellow and red date back to Iyasu V (reigned 1913-1916). The current flag and emblem were adopted after the defeat of Ethiopia's Marxist Derg regime (in power from 1974 to 1991). The emblem is intended to represent both the diversity and unity of the country. Blue represents peace, the star represents diversity and unity, and the sun's rays symbolise prosperity. The green recalls the <b>land,</b> yellow stands <b>for</b> <b>peace</b> and hope, and red is symbolic of strength.|$|R
