40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the capabilities of four applicable <b>lighting</b> <b>regimes</b> in inducing the onset of correct sexual maturity of developer layer pullets. The applied <b>lighting</b> <b>regimes</b> include natural day light (NDΩ 12 hrs <b>light),</b> continuous <b>lighting</b> <b>regime</b> (CLR Ω 24 hrs light), boosted natural day length (BND Ω 16 HL: 8 HD) and 2 -stages <b>lighting</b> <b>regimes</b> (2 -SLR Ω 12 HL: 4 HD: 8 HL). The four <b>lighting</b> <b>regime</b> and 64 grower layer pullets were randomly and evenly distributed to 16 similar experimental pens within an open – type poultry house. The experimental pens were equipped with all required facilities and prepared with an aid of black curtains to keep them light-tight. The experiment was commenced when the grower pullets were 10 weeks old and continued for a week post the onset of laying. During this period the experimental birds were kept restricted to the planned <b>lighting</b> <b>regimes,</b> got accessible to water and feed and vaccinated against the endemic diseases (New-Castle, Infectious Bronchitis and Fowl Pox). Data collected include: age, body weight, egg size and feed intake at point of lay and a week after in addition to mortality rate throughout the experimental period. The collected data were statistically analyzed {{to come up with}} the following results: The developer pullets reflected at point of lay showed significantly (P< 0. 05) controversial responses towards the examined lighting regimes; The flock developed under CLR demonstrated the youngest age at point of lay (131 days), the highest rates of feed intake and body weight gain in addition to the smallest first egg size; The flock exposed to the ND responded significantly (P< 0. 05) in a complete opposite manner to that of the former group under CLR. In contrast to the response patterns of the former two flocks (CLR and ND), the interaction trends and magnitude of the flocks confined to either the BND (16 hrs light) or the 2 - SLR (20 hrs light) were moderate. With the exception of feed intake of the ND group, no other apparent changes in performance pattern of the studied flocks were observed through a week post the onset of production.

40|$|International audienceLight {{variation}} in {{temporal and spatial}} domains is a key constraint on the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton. The most obvious responses are the modification of cell pigment content either to improve photocapture or to mitigate photo-damage. Very few studies have analyzed whether light variation significantly alters carbon assimilation, especially in a fluctuating light environment as in the mixed layer of the ocean. We addressed the question using a modeling approach, which allows the reproduction {{of most of the}} possible scenarios, obtained with great difficulty in laboratory or field experiments. The complete model is based on the dynamic coupling of a photoacclimation and photodamage-repair responses. In this combined model the virtual phytoplankton is exposed to different <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> (steady, square wave, sinusoidal Light-Dark cycles and fluctuating regimes). The results reconcile controversial results on different photacclimation states achieved during fluctuating <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> The model produces a depression of carbon assimilation in any light fluctuating scenario, as compared to steady <b>light</b> <b>regimes,</b> due to the temporal delay between light fluctuations and photoresponses.

50|$|Coloration in {{invertebrates}} varies {{based on}} the depth, water temperature, food source, currents, geographic location, light exposure, and sedimentation. For example, the amount of carotenoid a certain sea anemone decreases as we go deeper into the ocean. Thus, the marine life that resides on deeper waters is less brilliant than the organisms that live in well-lit areas due to the reduction of pigments. In the colonies of the colonial ascidian-cyanophyte symbiosis Trididemnum solidum, their colors are different depending on the <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> in which they live. The colonies that are exposed to full sunlight are heavily calcified, thicker, and are white. In contrast the colonies that live in shaded areas have more phycoerythrin (pigment that absorbs green) in comparison to phycocyanin (pigment that absorbs red), thinner, and are purple. The purple color in the shaded colonies are mainly due to the phycobilin pigment of the algae, meaning the variation of exposure in light changes the colors of these colonies.|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of Marimo colonies in Lake Akan, Hokkaidō in Japan and in Lake Mývatn in Iceland {{depends on the}} adaptation of the species to low light conditions, combined with the dynamic interaction of wind-induced currents, <b>light</b> <b>regime,</b> lake morphology, bottom substrate and sedimentation.The growth rate of Marimo is about 5 mm per year. In Lake Akan they grow particularly large, up to 20 - 30 cm. Mývatn, Iceland, has dense colonies of marimo that grow to about 12 cm in diameter and form well defined patches on the lake floor at depths ranging from 2 - 2.5 m. The colonies were discovered in 1978 but have shrunk considerably in size since then. The round shape of the marimo is maintained by gentle wave action that occasionally turns it. The balls are green all the way round which guarantees that they can photosynthesize no matter which side is turned upwards. Inside, the ball is also green and packed with dormant chloroplasts which become active {{in a matter of}} hours if the ball breaks apart. The wave action also cleans the balls of detritus. As some colonies have two or even three layers of marimo balls, wave action is needed to tumble them around so each ball reaches the light. The spherical shape has a low surface-area-to-volume ratio compared to a leaf, which limits photosynthesis and therefore limits the maximum size of the marimo balls.|$|E

Due to the high capital expenditure and operationally intensive nature of current treatments, phycoremediation, which employs microalgae species, provides an alternative and sustainable method of biological wastewater treatment. Six microalgae species, Stichoccocus bacillaris, Brachiomonas submarina pulsifera, Tetraselmis sp., Dunaliella salina, Euglena mutabilis, and Oscillatoria sp. were initially investigated, due to the range of biochemical and physical characteristics, and to analyse the potential of each strain, given their less well-characterised information on the growth in industrial effluent and under different <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> Among the selected species, novel chlorophyta S. bacillaris and cyanophyta Oscillatoria sp. were found to grow successfully in palm oil mill effluent under 16 : 8 and 8 : 16 <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> In comparison to the growth observed in the control medium, chlorophyta S. bacillaris exhibited a highly significant increase in cell numbers when it was cultivated in palm oil mill effluent: 89. 95 % (p -value = 0. 0004) and 87. 72 % (p -value = 0. 0009) under the 16 : 8 light and 8 : 16 <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> respectively. Chlorophyll and protein contents were also {{found to be significantly}} higher when cultivated in palm oil mill effluent than grown in the control medium. In parallel to the cells growth in palm oil mill effluent, the novel species was also able to remediate the industrial wastewater as there was a simultaneous decrease in palm oil loads after 10 days of cultivation and treatment. It was indicated by a significant decrease in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) by S. bacillaris; by 85. 31 % (p -value = 0. 000027) and 80. 88 % (p -value = 0. 000023) under 16 : 8 light and 8 : 16 <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> respectively. Further assessment revealed the significant reduction of total phosphate by 93. 07 % (p -value = 0. 00015) under 16 : 8 light and 88. 25 % (p-value = 0. 000039) under 8 : 16 light, and nitrate by 78. 14 % (p -value = 0. 00037) under 16 : 8 light and 72. 9 % (p-value = 0. 00056) under 8 : 16 light. Although the cultivated cyanophyta Oscillatoria sp. in palm oil mill effluent showed an increase in cell counts, chlorophyll, and protein content under both <b>light</b> <b>regimes,</b> assessments of these factors showed them to be non-significant when compared to their growth in the control medium. Despite these results, pollution loads in palm oil mill effluent were significantly reduced by both species. COD was decreased by 78. 22 % (p -value = 0. 00001), and 82. 9 % (p -value = 0. 0000015) under the 16 : 8 and 8 : 16 <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> respectively, whereas total phosphate and nitrate were both demonstrably reduced by between 78. 69 % and 85. 85 % under both <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> Turbidity level was also demonstrated to have reduced significantly in palm oil mill effluent after the cultivation of S. bacillaris, by 44. 04 % (p -value = 0. 013), and 19. 08 % (p -value = 0. 0047) under 16 : 8 and 8 : 16 <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> respectively, after 10 days of treatment. Oscillatoria sp. was consistently efficient at reducing turbidity, by 34. 69 % (p -value = 0. 00435) under 16 : 8 light and 36. 64 % (p -value = 0. 00006) under 8 : 16 light. Besides the importance of applied photoperiods for the study of algal biomass growth, the findings established also provide an insight into phycoremediation, an environmentally desirable and sustainable solution for pollutant removal. The optimisation of this technology requires further biochemical assessments in order to determine possible technoeconomic advantages of phycoremediation and the key parameters dictating pollution load reduction.

(Moraceae), a large evergreen late successional shade-tolerant tree species in three contrasting light conditions. Seed mass varied many fold from 1. 5 to 14 g in A. heterophyllus. Germination and germination time showed a significant correlation with seed mass. Germination differed significantly among three light regimes (50 %, 25 % and 3 %). Seed mass and light level significantly affected seedling survival. The seedlings that emerged from large seeds survived better than those from small seeds under all light regimes. Survival of seedlings was maximum in 25 % <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> for all seed mass classes but did not differ significantly from that at 50 % <b>light</b> <b>regime.</b> Survival was significantly lower in 3 % light as compared to 50 % and 25 % light regimes.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{evaluate}} the mycelial growth and fruiting vigor of Dothichiza populea Sacc. et Br. under various temperatures, pH values, and <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> Effect of temperature on the fungus growth was examined by growing isolates in polythermostat at 5 °C to 30 °C. The best mycelial growth occurred at 20 °C, while at 30 °C it was inhibited. Fruiting of the fungus was not observed at 5 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C. However, the best fruiting of the isolates appeared at 20 °C. The influence of different pH of the cultivation medium (3, 5 - 10) on the fungus isolates growth was also evaluated. Optimal pH for the fungus growth ranged between 6 and 8, while formation of reproductive organs occurred at all pH values. The influence of two <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> (light/dark regime and continuous dark) on the fungus growth was also studied. Obtained results showed that mycelial growth and fruiting of the fungus were considerably better under the light/dark regime...|$|R

40|$|An {{endogenous}} {{control of}} timing of many events like oviposition, eclosion, and hatching occurs {{at a particular}} time of the day, which enhances the survival of an organism. The present study is an attempt to understand the effect of different <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> on eclosion rhythm of Drosophila agumbensis and Drosophila nagarholensis. The eclosion rhythm of the two species were analyzed under constant conditions such as continuous light (LL), continuous dark (DD), and 12 -h light and 12 -h dark condition. Eclosion occurred only during morning period. The peak of eclosion was observed during 10 h in the morning in all the three <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> of both the species in 10 th and 20 th generation. Analysis of variance revealed that there is {{a significant difference in the}} eclosion between light/dark, DD, and LL condition and Student t test revealed that there is no significant difference between the two species...|$|R
40|$|Substrains of the C 57 BL/ 6 inbred mouse {{are widely}} used in genetic, {{behavioral}} and physiological research, as well as models for human disease. Throughout, {{the choice of the}} respective substrain can have a large influence on experimental results. Likewise, the conditions under which experiments are performed, such as the <b>light</b> <b>regime,</b> can significantly affect the outcome of an experiment, especially when aiming at experimental behavior. Here, two commonly used mouse substrains, C 57 BL/ 6 JOlaHsd and C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl, were housed under either a conventional or a reverse <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> and were tested in either the light phase or the dark phase, respectively. All animals were exposed to three unconditioned anxiety-related behavior set-ups: the modified Hole Board test, the light-dark box and the elevated plus maze. Significant substrain and <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> effects were found in all three behavioral tests, with some of the latter being substrain and test specific. This signifies the importance of the choice of substrain used in for example, a mouse knockout experiment studying behavior, also in relation to <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> under which the animals are tested...|$|E

40|$|Photoacclimation of Scenedesmus protuberans Fritsch to {{fluctuating}} irradiances, simulating vertical mixing, was {{studied in}} light-limited continuous cultures. The algae {{were exposed to}} a simple sinusoidal <b>light</b> <b>regime</b> simulating diurnal irradiance, and two fluctuating regimes in which light fluctuations resulting from four and eight vertical circulations of the algae through the water column were imposed on the sinusoidal <b>light</b> <b>regime.</b> The total daily light dose (TDLD) was kept constant. Maximum photosynthesis increased, and cellular chlorophyll content and photosynthetic unit size decreased in response to light fluctuations. The efficiency of photosynthesis decreased during the light period in the sinusoidal <b>light</b> <b>regime,</b> whereas it remained {{at the same level}} in the fluctuating light regimes. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to intermediate irradiances lowers the photosynthetic efficiency of S. protuberans more than short exposure to high irradiances alternated by low-light periods, and that this species is able to optimize its photosynthesis in fluctuating light.

40|$|In {{order to}} get a basic {{knowledge}} about the growth and carbon budget of Spirulina pacifica, the alga was cultured under different <b>light</b> <b>regimes</b> (40, 100 and 200 μmol photon m super(- 2) ·s super(- 1) and its growth, organic carbon content and carbon incorporation were investigated. The alga grew faster at the intermediate level of light compared to the high and low regimes, with the maximum growth rate being 0. 5 doublings per day and the end biomass density 2 g per L; it also grew well in diluted seawater. The removal of inorganic carbon and the accumulation of total organic and extracellular organic carbon increased with increased light intensity. The organic carbon content of Spirulina pacifica did not show significant difference among the cultures maintained under different <b>light</b> <b>regimes.</b> The mean organic carbon content was 30 % (w/w) of the dry alga...|$|R
