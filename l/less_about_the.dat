5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

25|$|The Black Death was {{the first}} {{occurrence}} of the , which would continue to strike England {{and the rest of}} Europe more or less regularly until the eighteenth century. The first serious recurrence in England came in the years 1361−62. We know <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> death rates caused by these later outbreaks, but this so-called pestis secunda may have had a mortality of around 20%. This epidemic was also particularly devastating for the population's ability to recover, since it disproportionately affected infants and young men. This was also the case with the next occurrence, in 1369, where the death rate was around 10−15%.|$|E
25|$|It {{began on}} 12 December 1575 when Emperor Maximillian {{was chosen as}} monarch by the Polish Senate, while the {{majority}} of the szlachta (nobility) had voted for Bathory. It ended on 16 December 1577. Maximilian's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges. With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily, a compromise was reached, with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized, in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as the king.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, Good to Go (or Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> music and more about drugs and violence, {{and despite the fact that}} most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E

Hughes {{did not have a}} successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not care <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|E
25|$|In August 1576 Bathory led 2,000 (Polish {{soldiers}} and mercenaries from Transylvania and Wallachia) men to Malbork (Marienburg), from there Polish units took control the area surrounding Gdansk, capturing Grabina and Głowa, two strategically important villages, thereby blockading Danzig's port {{from the east}} and the south. The King left the army under the command of Hetman Jan Zborowski and most of the forces were stationed at Tczew (Dirschau). In the west the main base was at Puck (Putzig), where there was a mercenary force led by Ernest Weyher. While some Polish privateer ships fought the Gdansk and Danish fleets, {{for the most part the}} control of the Baltic Sea belonged to the Danzigers and their allies. Soon after the fighting begun, Maximilian's II death (12 October 1576) was announced; this weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges.|$|E

500|$|Magna Carta carries little legal {{weight in}} modern Britain, {{as most of}} its clauses have been {{repealed}} and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that {{the survival of the}} 1215 charter in national life is a [...] "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" [...] and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries. The historian W. L.

[...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

Slowly the novel became [...] "more and more about these ordinary mysteries of life and <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fantastic time-travel-y one". After developing the basic idea, Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical. She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects, since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles.

500|$|Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs {{superior}} to Donald Bradman, often {{regarded as the}} greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: [...] "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sheer slog of carving out big scores." [...] Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in Wisden in 2000 stated: [...] "He was never as dominant as Bradman; he never wanted to be. But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions." ...|$|E

[...] Like Tell All Your Friends, the album's song titles were gleaned primarily from TV. The title of [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt.

Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is <b>less</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E
