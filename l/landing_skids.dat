5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he {{continues}} to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> and flown out.|$|E
5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E

25|$|Power {{consumption}} compares favourably {{with other}} high-speed rail systems. With an efficiency of 0.85, the power required is about 4.2 MW. Energy consumption for levitation and guidance purposes equates to approximately 1.7kW/t. As the propulsion system is also capable of functioning in reverse, energy is transferred {{back into the}} electrical grid during braking. An exception to this is when an emergency stop is performed using the emergency <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> beneath the vehicle, although this method of bringing the vehicle to a stop is intended {{only as a last}} resort should it be impossible or undesirable to keep the vehicle levitating on back-up power to a natural halt.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high <b>landing</b> <b>skids,</b> cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E
2500|$|In service between 1960 and 1972, the XM1 {{consisted}} of two [...]30-caliber M37C [...] machine guns mounted on the <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> of either the OH-13 or OH-23 helicopter. These weapons were fixed forward, but flexible in elevation, with their ammunition (500 rounds per gun) stored externally. The XM1E1 was the product engineering design.|$|E
50|$|Specially {{strengthened}} {{and modified}} version, built for a non-stop North-Atlantic crossing. The aircraft was {{powered by a}} Jupiter radial, fitted with jettisonable landing gear and a strengthened <b>landing</b> <b>skid.</b> Only two were built.|$|R
40|$|A major {{characteristic}} of helicopters is their vertical takeoff and landing ability. To improve the assistance for helicopter pilots for these manoeuvres especially in poor visibility, landing is detected and {{the event is}} dis-played. In this paper, automatic landing detection refers to the event that touchdown of a helicopter is achieved. To realise automatic landing detection, the ground contact of the <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> has to be detected reliably. Here, DLR’s Flying Helicopter Simulator FHS is used as testbed. The deformation of the <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> of the FHS can be measured by means of strain gauges. Based on flight tests, a stochastic model of the measured strain gauge signals is derived and based on that an algorithm for landing detection is designed. The parameters of the algorithm are adjusted {{by means of a}} Monte Carlo simulation. The determined parameter set is then used in flight tests where the computed landing state of each edge of the <b>landing</b> <b>skid</b> is displayed to the pilot. Based on several landings on asphalt and on grass the landing detection is rated by helicopter pilots to be helpful...|$|R

2500|$|For the 1920 Rhön {{meeting at}} Wasserkuppe the FVA built a simple {{monoplane}} glider. This aircraft, the FVA-1 [...] Schwatze Düvel, was an internally braced, thick airfoil cantilever monoplane with large trousers over <b>landing</b> <b>skids</b> on each side. To keep costs low the aircraft was largely covered in black muslin fabric, {{donated by the}} father of a student's girlfriend. Cardboard was used on the wing leading edges and fuselage nose rather than expensive aircraft plywood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I chose my Paul Veroner {{monoplane}} for the job. There's {{nothing like}} a monoplane when real work is to be done. Beaumont found that out in very early days. For one thing it doesn't mind damp, and the weather looks as if we {{should be in the}} clouds all the time. It's a bonny little model and answers my hand like a tender-mouthed horse. The engine is a ten-cylinder rotary Robur working up to one hundred and seventy-five. It has all the modern improvements--enclosed fuselage, high-curved <b>landing</b> <b>skids,</b> brakes, gyroscopic steadiers, and three speeds, worked by an alteration of the angle of the planes upon the Venetian-blind principle. I took a shot-gun with me and a dozen cartridges filled with buck-shot. You should have seen the face of Perkins, my old mechanic, when I directed him to put them in. I was dressed like an Arctic explorer, with two jerseys under my overalls, thick socks inside my padded boots, a storm-cap with flaps, and my talc goggles. It was stifling outside the hangars, but I was going for the summit of the Himalayas, and had to dress for the part. Perkins knew there was something on and implored me to take him with me. Perhaps I should if I were using the biplane, but a monoplane is a one-man show--if {{you want to get the}} last foot of life out of it. Of course, I took an oxygen bag; the man who goes for the altitude record without one will either be frozen or smothered--or both.|$|E

5000|$|Both Dyna-Soar and Spiral were {{designed}} to land on skids.
