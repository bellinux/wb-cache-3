40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> between <b>the</b> lid wiper and the ocular surface, {{and between}} a contact lens and the lid wiper, are {{reported}} {{to be related to}} dry eye symptoms. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> between these sliding partners are assumed {{to be related to the}} ocular signs of lid-wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) and lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF). Recent literature provides some evidence that a contact lens with a low coefficient of friction (CoF) improves wearing comfort by reducing <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> between <b>the</b> contact lens surface and the lid wiper. This review discusses <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>forces</b> during spontaneous blinks from a tribological perspective, at both low and high sliding velocities, in a healthy subject. It concludes that the coefficient of friction of the ocular surfaces appears to be strongly comparable to that of hydrophilic polymer brushes at low sliding velocity, and that, with increased sliding velocity, there is no wear at the sliding partners' surfaces thanks to the presence of a fluid film between the two sliding partners. In contrast, in the case of dry eye, the failure to maintain a full fluid film lubrication regime at high blinking speeds may lead to increased shear rates, resulting in deformation and wear of the sliding pairs. These shear rates are most likely related to tear film viscosity...|$|R
