5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{peripheral}} <b>vision</b> {{while retaining}} central vision {{is known as}} tunnel <b>vision,</b> and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> central <b>vision</b> while retaining peripheral vision is known as central scotoma.|$|R

5|$|Schuur {{was born}} in Tacoma, Washington, two months {{premature}} and weighing less than three pounds. Complications of prematurity resulted in her total <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Her twin brother, David, had normal vision at birth but some hearing loss. She also has an older sister. Schuur grew up in Auburn, Washington, a southern suburb of Seattle. She attended the Washington School for the Blind in Vancouver from age four to eleven. She lived at school but was able to commute home 150miles on the train by herself. She later transferred to public school where teachers' aides helped her keep up in class.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of an {{appearance}} of sudden flashes of light or floaters, an eye doctor needs to be consulted immediately. A shower of floaters or any <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> too, is a medical emergency.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{made from}} {{physical}} signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, {{the majority of cases}} are asymptomatic. Prior to the very severe <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.|$|E
25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} is {{a disorder}} {{of the eye}} in which the retina separates from the layer underneath. Symptoms include {{an increase in the number}} of floaters, flashes of light, and worsening of the outer part of the visual field. This may be described as a curtain over part of the field of vision. In about 7% of cases both eyes are affected. Without treatment permanent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> may occur.|$|E

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|Cat food is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards. Long-term taurine deficiency {{may result in}} retinal degeneration, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> and cardiac arrest.|$|E

After being forced to retire in 1996 at age 36 due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion, Puckett {{was elected to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten hexafluoride is an {{extremely}} corrosive compound that attacks any tissue. Exposure of humans to the gas first affects the eyes and respiratory tracts causing irritation, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> cough, and excessive formation of saliva and sputum. Upon mixing with the body fluids, the gas transforms into hydrofluoric acid which burns the skin and mucous tissues of the respiratory tract. Upon prolonged exposure, this results in pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, and could be fatal. Because {{of the formation of}} hydrofluoric acid upon reaction of WF6 with humidity, WF6 storage vessels have Teflon gaskets.|$|E
25|$|Eye damage. Though it is unlikely, {{high power}} visible or {{invisible}} (infrared, ultraviolet) laser light could cause permanent eye injury. The injury could be relatively minor, such as spots only detectable by medical exam {{or on the}} periphery of vision. At higher power levels, the spots may be in the central vision, in the same area where the original light was viewed. Most unlikely of all is injury causing a complete and permanent <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> To do this requires very specialized equipment and a desire to deliberately target aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Cavernous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CST) is {{the formation}} of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity {{at the base of the}} brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria. Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> chemosis, exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is being done}} on macular degeneration which could help prevent cases of micropsia. A variety of drugs that block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are being evaluated as a treatment option. These treatments {{for the first time}} have produced actual improvements in vision, rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> characteristic of macular degeneration. A number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for macular degeneration lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment, including macular translocation to a healthier area of the eye, displacement of submacular blood using gas, and removing membranes by surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the {{opportunity}} to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> generally thought to be hypertension-related, and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivalled Emperor Gaozong's.|$|E
