5000|$|From 1984 to 1989, Maggart starred on the {{groundbreaking}} Showtime original comedy Brothers, {{where he played}} eldest brother <b>Lou</b> <b>Waters.</b> For his role on Brothers, Maggart was nominated for four Cable ACE awards (for Best Actor in a Comedy Series) in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 Muse left Channel 4 {{to become}} one of the first 12 anchors on CNN in Atlanta, Georgia. Following rehearsals in May, CNN went on the air on June 1, 1980, with Muse co-anchoring the 8:00 pm {{broadcast}} segment with <b>Lou</b> <b>Waters.</b> For the next four years, she commuted between Atlanta and her home and family in Denver.|$|E

40|$|Long column {{settling}} and jar {{tests were}} undertaken {{as part of}} a treatability study of combined sewage at the <b>Lou</b> Romano <b>Water</b> Reclamation Plant (LRWRP) in Windsor, Ontario. Different types of cationic polymers were exam-ined in jar tests, and the appropriate dosage and its relationship with the TSS removal were determined for the polymer coagulation process. Settling column tests were used to develop settling rate distribution curves under both chemi-cally aided and unaided conditions, and to examine the performance of poly-mer coagulation in improving the settleability of wet-weather sewage during CSO events. The results of the long column settling tests for settling rate dis-tributions show that the characteristics of the wet-weather sewage at the LRWRP during CSO events were similar to those of samples collected at actual overflow sites along the Windsor Riverfront. Settling rate distributions demon-strated that polymer addition to the wet-weather sewage significantly improved the settling characteristics.

40|$|Phosphorus {{is a vital}} {{nutrient}} {{for biological}} wastewater treatment plants, {{but it is also}} a regulated pollutant. The <b>Lou</b> Romano <b>Water</b> Reclamation Plant (LRWRP), located in Windsor, Ontario, uses chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) with alum and anionic polymer to remove phosphorus and suspended solids (SS). The plant was upgraded in 2007 to include biological aerated filter (BAF) as secondary treatment, and is currently adding phosphorus (∼ 0. 2 - 1 mg/L) following CEPT for the proper functioning of the BAF. Jar tests experiments revealed that alternate combinations of the currently used alum and anionic polymer were not able to reduce the amount of bioavailable phosphorus removed during CEPT while maintaining SS concentration in the primary effluent at levels suitable for the BAF. This objective was achieved using other chemical (cationic polymer) combinations. However this option is not economically viable at the current costs of various chemicals and phosphorus supplement being used...|$|R
50|$|Harris {{auditioned for}} an anchor {{position}} during summer 1991; {{a few months}} later he was given a full-time anchor post. Harris received numerous awards at CNN, including several Emmy Awards for his coverage of the 2000 presidential election, the Oklahoma City bombing and the September 11th attacks. However, as competition increased from Fox News, and CNN veterans such as Natalie Allen and <b>Lou</b> <b>Waters</b> were pink-slipped in favor of Paula Zahn and Aaron Brown, Harris felt less comfortable. His last position held at CNN was co-anchor of CNN Live Today with Daryn Kagan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lou</b> <b>Waters</b> {{was one of}} the {{original}} anchors of Cable News Network an American cable news station when it first aired in the summer of 1980. He remained one of the network's primary anchors until September 2001, adding to a journalism career spanning nearly 40 years. For much of his tenure with the network, Waters anchored CNN Today with Natalie Allen. Additionally, he co-anchored Early Prime and hosted special editions, including Coming of Age, a series on aging in American society. Waters spoke to expert scientists and people of all ages about their views on aging for this series.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, KRNA's format {{shifted from}} classic rock to active rock, {{adopting}} the nickname [...] "Real Rock 94.1". That year, former KFMW morning DJ's <b>Lou</b> <b>Waters</b> and Scott Steele became the station's morning-drive disc jockeys. Lou and Scott {{were replaced by}} Davenport-based DJ's Greg Dwyer and Bill Michaels in January 2007. Dwyer and Michaels joined KRNA {{as the result of}} a non-compete clause that prevented them from working at any station in the Quad Cities market for six months after their contract with Clear Channel Communications expired at the end of 2006. Dwyer and Michaels, who had previously worked with WXLP and KCQQ radio in the Quad Cities, rejoined Cumulus-owned WXLP on July 13, 2007, but continued to simulcast their show on KRNA until late 2008. Clear Channel sued Dwyer and Michaels in February 2007, claiming that KRNA was audible in the Quad Cities area and the duo was actively promoting the show in the Quad Cities. On March 1, 2007, a Scott County judge ruled that Dwyer and Michaels did not violate the clause since Arbitron did not consider the Quad Cities part of KRNA's market area.|$|E
40|$|Aeration is a {{major part}} of the {{operation}} cost in biological aerated filtration (BAF) systems for wastewater treatment. This thesis investigated the effect of reducing aeration at the City of Windsor 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Lou</b> Romano <b>Water</b> Reclamation Plant to find the lowest possible airflow while maintaining a satisfactory ammonia and biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the BAF effluent. A series of tests were conducted at different airflows in cell # 7 at the plant to find the lowest possible airflow while maintaining a satisfactory ammonia and biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the BAF effluent. Profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, BOD, ammonia and nitrate concentration were measured along the height of the cell and at different time intervals during filtration, at air flow rates varying from 1300 to 1700 m 3 /h per cell. This study found that the BOD and ammonium removal were satisfactory at 1300 m 3 /h airflow rate...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Lee [...] "Bob" [...] Waters (June 22, 1938 - May 29, 1989) was an American {{football}} player, coach, and administrator, {{best known}} for his contributions to athletics at Western Carolina University. Waters coached the Western Carolina Catamounts football team for 20 seasons (1969-1988), and performed the dual role of athletic director from 1971 through 1986. According to the university, [...] "the evolution and success of the school's athletic programs, especially its football program, during that period can be attributed largely to his talents and personality". In March 1989, during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or <b>Lou</b> Gehrig's disease), <b>Waters</b> was reassigned from his head coaching position by university chancellor Myron Coulter. He died on May 29, 1989, at his home in Cullowhee, North Carolina, at the age of 50 following a six-year battle with the disease.|$|R
