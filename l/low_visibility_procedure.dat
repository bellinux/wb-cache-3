40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> and their direct {{application}} to airports, aircrafts, and aircraft operators. The main {{objective was to}} characterize the <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> as a file of conditions for airport equipment, aircraft equipment, skills and qualifications of the flight crew, and operating procedures. The work also raises the importance of analysis in terms of <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> in which the take-off, approach, and landing can be proceeded. A secondary objective was to cut the <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> requirements out of its basic form and convert it through practical application into a more comprehensible form. The result is {{an overview of the}} <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> for a point of view from both amateur and professional stand...|$|R

50|$|The wheel turned {{full circle}} when in December 2006 London Heathrow was {{affected}} {{for a long}} period by dense fog. This airport was operating at maximum capacity in good conditions, and the imposition of <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures</b> required to protect the localiser signal for autoland systems meant a major reduction in capacity from approximately 60 to 30 landings per hour. Since most airlines operating into Heathrow already had autoland-equipped aircraft, and thus expected to operate as normal, massive delays occurred. The worst affected airline was of course British Airways, as the largest operator at the airport.|$|R

40|$|An applied {{climatology}} of <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> {{has been developed}} for the coastal waters of southern Maine and New Hampshire. <b>Low</b> <b>visibility,</b> defined as 450 meters (nautical miles (NM)) or less, can pose a significant hazard to marine operations. An examination of <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> over the coastal waters of southern Maine and New Hampshire was performed using hourly observations from selected Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS) buoys in the Gray, ME (GYX) coastal waters for the period 2001 through 2007. From these data, frequency distributions and composite maps were constructed. The highest percentage of hourly observations with <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> occurred across the coastal waters of central Maine, with the lowest percentage across the coastal waters of New Hampshire. A south to southeast wind was favored for <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> at all buoy locations. July had {{the highest number of}} <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> observations at all buoy locations, with a general maximum occurring June through August. This coincides with the highest dew point temperatures of the year over the coastal waters. For GoMOOS buoys closer to shore, the number of hourly observations with visibilities of 450 meters or less reached a minimum in the late afternoon and early evening. The maximum occurred just before sunrise. For GoMOOS buoys further offshore, the differences between the maximum and minimum were less distinct...|$|R

40|$|The Air Traffic Management {{consists}} {{of a set of}} services aiming primarily at ensuring the safety of the flights. Those services are provided by various systems (people, process & technology) that separate aircraft, prevent collisions, organise and expedite the flows of traffic and also provide information. Just in Europe the ATM services are provided by more than 30 Providers, employing about 20000 controllers in 80 Control Centres, on 500 Airports, and managing daily over 30000 flights. The evolution of the number of passengers, i. e. flights, is noticeable and seems to be growing even more in the next years. This growth is related with Europe economical growth and its tendency is positive. Due to its high demand, the environment of the aerial transportation requires technological changes in order to sustain our social needs. One of the aspects that urges to improve is efficiency of the air traffic management process. This urge has led to important efforts in designing automation systems for air traffic control (ATC) with the objective of increasing the capacity and safety. The ATC system is the responsible of maintaining an organized and secure flow of aircraft. During good visibility conditions, the air tower controllers may clear aircraft to make a visual landing under tower control supervision. Pilots assume responsibility for separating themselves from other aircraft, with the controllers in contact to warn them to deviate in case of a potential conflict. During times of poor visibility, the ATC team retains responsibility for separating the aircraft on final approach. Therefore, a critical responsibility relies on the ATC team. Poor visibility conditions occur during periods of adverse weather, such as fog, snow, rain, smoke, dust or any other type of environmental occlusion. Controllers at airports must work under <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>procedures,</b> which allow airport operations to continue safely and cover the procedures of approach, ground movement and departures. As a result, the spacing on approach is increased, because like this aircraft can land and clear the runway before other aircraft are given landing permission. More widely spacing is necessary too when manoeuvring or taxiing during both arrivals or departures. All of this means that fewer aircraft can land or depart within a given time, causing delays, and consequently, a reduction in the capacity of the airport. Poor visibility conditions are a factor to take into account. New systems pursuing improved safety, resilience and maintenance of capacity during poor visibility conditions are required and this is where augmented reality (AR) enters at stake. AR consists on overlapping computer generated objects with the aim of augmenting and increasing the perception of the environment for the users, in this case, the ATC. Like this, the users can visualize what they cannot see due to weather conditions and thus, maintain safety and capacity. Additional data of the aircraft that is not found on the environment can be given too, like wake vortex information, trajectory data, ground unexpected objects [...] . The ATC team may be equipped with other wearable devices too in order to enhance their perception in the AR. There are explorative research projects concerning this framework in SESAR JU in order to explore and advance in the concept of AR devices in the control tower, such as the RETINA project: Resilient Synthetic Vision for Advanced Control Tower Air Navigation Service Provision. To deepen in this topic, a basic simulation project has to be done to explain and prove this, so a 3 D model prototype is required and that is what this thesis tries to support, because with this analysis it is pursued that the tasks of the ATC team become weather-independent...|$|R

Roads for experiment {{of this study}} are Gyeongbu expressway, Seohaean expressway, Yeongdong expressway and Seoul beltway in Gyeonggi province.
