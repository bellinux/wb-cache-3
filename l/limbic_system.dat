5|$|The term <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} <b>limbic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paul Broca {{associated}} {{regions of}} the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients. John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of the}} motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided {{regions of the}} brain based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> functions. The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E
25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> begin to function. The <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated with a feeling of contentedness. Further development of the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{is vital}} to {{experiences}} and related to <b>limbic</b> <b>systems,</b> it is the retention of information over time {{for the purpose of}} influencing future action. If we could not remember past events, we could not learn or develop language, relationships, nor personal identity (Eysenck, 2012).|$|R
50|$|Research also implicates {{that the}} {{referred}} behavioral effects are moderated by neuroendocrine phenomena involving serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, {{and in the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, locus ceruleus and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2005; Marinia et alli, 2006; Huhman, 2006).|$|R
50|$|The cingulate gyrus plays a {{key role}} in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system’s</b> emotion {{formation}} and processing. The cingulate cortex is separated into an anterior and a posterior region, which corresponds to areas 24, 32, 33 (anterior) and 23 (posterior) of the Brodmann areas. The anterior region receives information mainly from the mamillary bodies while the posterior cingulate receives information from the subiculum via the Papez circuit.|$|R
25|$|Much of the <b>limbic</b> <b>system,</b> which {{contains}} primitive brain structures relating to emotion and motivation, {{are involved in}} memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} structures in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system.</b> It is also known to play a role in the processing of and memory for emotional events.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is highly}} interconnected with {{other parts of}} the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the <b>limbic</b> <b>system,</b> it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Tracer {{studies in}} monkeys {{have shown that}} the orbitofrontal cortex shares {{extensive}} connections with other association cortices, primary sensory and association cortices, <b>limbic</b> <b>systems,</b> and other subcortical areas. Corticocortical connections include extensive local projections to and from other prefrontal regions, as well as with motor, limbic, and sensory cortices. Areas projecting to motor areas are densely interconnected with other prefrontal cortical regions, reflecting integration for executive motor control.|$|R
50|$|His {{theory was}} based on {{theories}} of the modularity of cognitive functions, including well-documented specializations in the brain's cerebral cortex and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems,</b> and the research into left-right brain laterilization by Roger Wolcott Sperry, Robert Ornstein, Henry Mintzberg, and Michael Gazzaniga. These theories were further developed to reflect a metaphor for how individuals think and learn. Use of that metaphor brought later criticism by brain researchers such as Terence Hines for being overly simplistic, however the metaphorical construct has proven effective {{in a variety of}} organizational contexts, especially for business and government.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developmental}} brain imaging {{studies have}} demonstrated that negatively coupled prefrontal-limbic circuitry implicates the maturation of brain development in adolescents. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and independent component analysis (ICA), the present study examined functional network coupling between prefrontal and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> and links to self-control and substance use onset in adolescents. Results suggest that negative network coupling (anti-correlated temporal dynamics) between the right fronto-parietal and limbic resting state networks is associated with greater self-control and later substance use onset in adolescents. These findings increase our understanding of the developmental importance of prefrontal-limbic circuitry for adolescent substance use at the resting-state network level...|$|R
25|$|Dopamine is {{associated}} with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases. The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see Cognitive development below).|$|E
25|$|Human {{brain wave}} {{patterns}} show distinct changes during orgasm, which indicate {{the importance of}} the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> in the orgasmic response. Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. These findings suggest that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, using rats, we have {{examined}} acute, contextual, and sensitized patterns of activated or phosphory-lated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) expres-sion in parallel, assaying across multiple nuclei {{that have been}} implicated in addiction. The paradigm used included a com-parison of pretreatment dose of amphetamine upon patterns of cellular activation, following rechallenge. Because efferent orexinergic projections synapse on many targets through the mammalian brain, including mesotelencephalic regions and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> involved in drug reward and reinforcement, we examined for coexpression of pCREB or c-Fos double labeling within orexin A-immunopositive neurons following sensitization. Acute challenge with amphetamine (1. 5 mg/kg i. p.) resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of pCREB-immunoreactive (-IR) cell...|$|R
5000|$|... {{temperament}} traits regulating behaviour at {{two levels}} of situational emergency, associated with different degree of emotional response are classically described as two groups: Emotionality and Activity/Energy. Combination of two extremes in these two basic dimensions were used to explain Hippocrates-Galen' four classic temperament types {{since the end of}} the 18th century, in the work of Kant, Heymans, Wundt, Stern, Pavlov, Adler, Stranger, Lasursky, Kretschmer and Sheldon. After the functions of the ARAS and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> were linked to physical and emotional arousal, Eysenck named this golden pair as 'Extraversion' and 'Neuroticism', followed by Thayer, Watson and Tellegen and the Big Five model of personality. Two emotional dispositions, Neuroticism and Self-Confidence were described from the 1970-80s in a number of Approach/Withdrawal (A/W) models (Akiskal, Gray, Simonov, Thomas & Chess, Windle & Lerner).|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year-old {{woman was}} {{transferred}} to our hospital after experiencing an epigastric sensation followed by unconsciousness. On arrival, the patient showed impaired consciousness without convulsive movement, cyanosis and shallow breathing, arterial O 2 desaturation, and increased PCO 2. Artificial respiration improved CO 2 accumulation and consciousness, but interruption of artificial respiration returned the patient to her former state. Computed tomography of the head showed a mass around the left corpus callosum. The patient 2 ̆ 7 s hypopnea followed by unconsciousness suggested sustained nonconvulsive epilepsy manifesting in central hypopnea and subsequent unconsciousness due to CO 2 narcosis. Intravenous (IV) anticonvulsants promptly improved the respiratory condition, and the patient started to regain consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion involving the bilateral <b>limbic</b> <b>systems.</b> To our knowledge, limbic seizure manifesting with hypopnea causing unconsciousness due to CO 2 narcosis has not previously been reported, despite evidence of a strong relationship between the <b>limbic</b> and respiratory <b>systems.</b> The current case suggests that sustained limbic seizure can manifest as hypopnea. Since emergency EEG {{can be difficult to}} perform, IV anticonvulsant treatment is an appropriate diagnostic therapy...|$|R
25|$|Neuroscience {{describes}} reward, pleasure, {{and motivation}} {{in terms of}} neurotransmitter activity, especially in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> and the ventral tegmental area in particular. If one believes that {{the meaning of life}} is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a science of morality– the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, neuropsychiatry, physiological, and imaging {{studies have}} shown PTSD and {{depression}} to be physical syndromes, in many respects, as they are psychiatric ones in demonstrating <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> physiological and anatomy disturbances. Attendant PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, which additionally increase physiological stress, may {{play a part in}} leading to frequent MH-like hyperpyrexia and speculate on its influence on underlying myopathology of FSS in other ways. PTSD may also bring about developmental delays or developmental stagnation, especially in paediatric patients.|$|E
25|$|Edelman's theory {{focuses on}} two nervous system organizations: the {{brainstem}} and limbic systems {{on one side}} and the thalamus and cerebral cortex on the other side. The brain stem and <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn adaptive behaviors.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{clinical}} aspects of attention including anatomy, cognitive neuropsychology, disorders, and functional imaging evidence {{for the role of}} attention in cognition. Particular emphasis is given to selected aspects of visual attention. Imaging studies discussed are primarily functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, some evidence will be provided from the time-honoured clinical method of lesion studies. Numerous cognitive processes come into play as one reads this chapter. In fact, it takes little introspection to realize the necessity for visual, language, working memory, and declarative memory (among other) systems in the reading process. Perhaps this chapter will contradict or confirm a cherished scientific belief, thus bringing <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> into play. However, the proper operation of all these systems would not be possible without a function that allowed the appropriate selection of stimuli, maintenance of concentration, and interactions with space and time. That cognitiv...|$|R
30|$|Our study aims {{to clarify}} the entire process between consumers’ {{reaction}} during the package opening period to their final decision to return or keep. Thus, we consider three types of processes that occur during one’s exposure to a stimulus event (Berkowitz 1993; LeDoux 1995; Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999), which is {{the opening of a}} delivery package. The first is the ‘low-road’ affective 1 processes, which are evoked rapidly and automatically in the <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> of the brain. The second is the ‘high-road’ cognitive processes that involve the cortical systems of the brain. In this stage, consumers collect and process information by thinking, reasoning, and being aware of their surroundings. The third is the ‘high-road’ affective processes, which arise from the outcomes of the second process (Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999), and occur relatively slowly compared to low-road affective reactions. All these affective and congnitive reactions can influence consumer return behavior and will be discussed in the next sections.|$|R
50|$|Children {{with autism}} have an {{impaired}} capability to solve problems, engage in thoughtful and appropriate behaviours, sustain relevant tasks and self-monitor. They lack mentalization or Theory of Mind (ToM) and have sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and intellectual deficits. This suggests {{that children with}} autism have general deficits in the high-order planning and regulatory systems, known as executive functions. Autistic individuals have an enlarged cortex characterized by irregular neuronal growth, a reduced volume of corpus callosum (impairing communication between hemispheres), abnormal structure and function of the frontal lobe, cerebellum, medial temporal lobe, related <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> (amygdala and hippocampus), and elevated levels of serotonin. These brain and molecular abnormalities {{could account for the}} characteristic impairment of executive functioning in autistic patients. The SAS is disrupted at some level and intensity in all five of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), which include Autism, Asperger syndrome (AS), Rett syndrome, Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the three-factor {{approach}} theorizes that neuroticism is mediated by levels of arousal in the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> and that individual differences arise because of variable activation thresholds between people. Therefore, highly neurotic people {{when presented with}} minor stressors, will exceed this threshold, whereas people low in neuroticism will not exceed normal activation levels, even when presented with large stressors. By contrast, proponents of the five-factor approach assume a role of genetics and environment but offer no explicit causal explanation.|$|E
25|$|It is popularly {{assumed that}} emotion {{disrupts}} cognition. However, neurophysiology and Ommaya's TBI research emphasize its fundamental inseparability. Ommaya defined four {{steps in the}} evolution of consciousness. 1) reflex and avoidance reactions; 2) sensory inputs merged with multisensory neurons in the mesencephalon; 3) interactions formed between sensory and limbic systems and memory; and 4) reinforcement of thalamic neural centers which relays information between sensory and motor centers. Ommaya discussed how the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> and emotion motivates action and focuses attention.|$|E
25|$|The ventral stream pathway {{is mainly}} {{involved}} in object recognition, {{and is known}} colloquially as the 'what' pathway. It has connections to the medial temporal lobe (which {{is involved in the}} storage of long-term memories), the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> (which regulates emotions), and the dorsal stream pathway (which is involved in the visual-spatial locations and motions of objects). Therefore, the ventral stream pathway not only deals with the recognition of objects in the external world, but also the emotional judgement and analysis of these objects.|$|E
40|$|Adolescence is a {{developmental}} period characterized by suboptimal decisions and {{actions that are}} associated with an increased incidence of unintentional injuries, violence, substance abuse, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for adolescent behavior have failed to account for the nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to both childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible model of the neural mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior. We provide evidence from recent human brain imaging and animal studies that there is a heightened responsiveness to incentives and socioemotional contexts during this time, when impulse control is still relatively immature. These findings suggest differential development of bottom-up <b>limbic</b> <b>systems,</b> implicated in incentive and emotional processing, to top-down control systems during adolescence as compared to childhood and adulthood. This developmental pattern may be exacerbated in those adolescents prone to emotional reactivity, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes...|$|R

The course of these maturational processes is being charted with greater specificity, owing to advances in neuroimaging and indicate grey matter volume reductions and protracted development of white matter in regions known to support complex cognition and behavior. Though fronto-subcortical circuitry development is notable during adolescence, asynchronous maturation of prefrontal and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> may render youth more vulnerable to risky behaviors such as substance use. Indeed, binge-pattern alcohol consumption and comorbid marijuana use are common among adolescents, and are associated with neural consequences. This review summarizes the unique characteristics of adolescent brain development, particularly aspects that predispose individuals to reward seeking and risky choices during this phase of life, and discusses the influence of substance use on neuromaturation.

40|$|Here, it {{is argued}} that the interoceptive system, which {{provides}} information about the subjects internal state and is integrated in the insular cortex, and not the subcortical ventral striatum, is the critical neural substrate for reward-related processes. Understanding the internal state of the individual, which is processed via this system, makes it possible to develop new interventions that are aimed at treating reward-dysfunction disorders, ie, substance and alcohol dependence. Although the ventral striatum is important for signaling the degree to which rewarding stimuli are predicted to occur, this system alone cannot account for the complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral phenomena that occur when individuals come into contact with potentially rewarding stimuli. On the other hand, the interoceptive system is able to make connections between all cortical, subcortical, and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems</b> to orchestrate a complex set of responses. Craving and urges are among the most notable responses, and may have important functions to preserve homeostasis...|$|R
25|$|The <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> {{can also}} {{significantly}} impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, {{it is not}} unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.|$|E

Studies that use neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FMRI have shown differences in brain structure of PCE children, for example in the cerebral cortex and <b>limbic</b> <b>system.</b> Those PCE children who had slowed brain growth as fetuses are at higher risk for impaired brain growth and motor, language and attention problems after they are born.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuitry}} {{involving the}} amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory {{along with the}} amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the <b>limbic</b> <b>system</b> (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, {{but this does not}} appear to have been proven.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{digestive}} peptides {{in brain}} started in 1975 {{with the discovery}} of peptides of the gastrin-cholecystokinin family in the brain of various vertebrates. Cholecystokinin octapeptide is largely distributed in the brain and neurohypophysis and its mapping has recently been reported by various authors. An up to data table summarizing CCK mapping is included. Cholecystokinin coexists with dopamine in some mesencephalic neurones and with oxytocin in some hypothalamic neurones. CCK immunoreactive fibers have been detected in the anterior commissura and in the corpus callosum especially after its surgical sectioning. CCK immunoreactive cell bodies are present in the nucleus septum lateralis, the nucleus of the bed of the stria terminalis and the nucleus preopticus medialis especially after direct colchicine injection into the cerebral hemispheres. Cholecystokinin is of importance in structures related to various physiological functions such as motricity, sensory mechanisms, endocrine and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems.</b> Consequently it should be interesting to study cholecystokinins in neurological disorders and in psychiatric conditions.

The patient {{presented}} to the emergency room with rapidly increasing symptoms, noninfectious cerebral spinal fluid associated with positive anti-NMDAR (as well as in serum) and positive AMPAR antibodies in the serum. Four months later, the patient was diagnosed with a small-cell lung cancer for which chemotherapy and radiotherapy was commenced. Simultaneously, endoscopic surgical treatment was undertaken for an in situ relapse of the bladder neoplasm. After the completion of 3 cycles of chemotherapy her neurological status temporarily worsened. The cerebral MRI did not show signs of encephalitis such as increased T 2 /FLAIR signal intensity in the mesial temporal lobes and <b>limbic</b> <b>systems.</b> No specific treatment was prescribed. Limbic encephalitis can be associated with malignant tumors such as lung carcinoma. Several cases reported in the literature have shown cognitive improvement after tumoral therapy.
