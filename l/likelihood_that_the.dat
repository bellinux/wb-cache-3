5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> predator will attack some other individual.|$|E

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

40|$|Psychological {{research}} on behavior has waned in recent decades. One underappreciated {{reason for this}} trend is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> field lacks a general-purpose framework targeted {{to the study of}} behavior. This chapter presents one such framework, a metatheory called the I 3 Model (pronounced “I-cubed model”), which suggests that all behavior emerges from a combination of three orthogonal processes. Instigation encompasses the effects of exposure to a particular target object in a particular context that normatively affords a certain behavior. Impellance encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors <b>that</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> (or <b>the</b> intensity with which) the individual enacts the behavior when encountering that target object in that context. Inhibition encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors <b>that</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> (or <b>the</b> extent to which) people will override the effects of instigation and impellance on behavior, thereby reducing its enactment. According to “Perfect Storm Theory, ” which is derived from the I 3 Model, the highest likelihood or intensity of behavior emerges when instigation and impellance are strong and inhibition is weak. The generativity and integrative potential of the I 3 Model and Perfect Storm Theory are illustrated with novel reviews of the aggression and eating behavior literatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between automatic processes and controlled processes {{is a central}} organizational theme across areas of psychology. However, this dichotomy conceals important differences among qualitatively different processes that independently contribute to ongoing behavior. The Quadruple process model is a multinomial model that provides quantitative estimates of 4 distinct processes in a single task: <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> an automatic response tendency is activated; <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> a contextually appropriate response can be determined; <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> automatic response tendencies are overcome when necessary; and <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> absence of other information, behavior is driven by a general response bias. The model integrates dual-process models from many domains of inquiry and offers a generalized, more nuanced framework of impulse regulation across these domains. The model offers insights into many central questions surrounding the operation and the interaction of automatic and controlled processes. Applications of the model to empirical and theoretical concerns {{in a variety of}} areas of psychology are discussed. © 2008 American Psychological Association...|$|R
