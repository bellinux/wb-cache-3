25|$|Partitioning is {{a process}} of {{dividing}} the chip into small blocks. This is done mainly to separate different functional blocks and also to make placement and routing easier. Partitioning can be done in the RTL design phase when the design engineer partitions the entire design into sub-blocks and then proceeds to design each module. These modules are linked together in the main module called the TOP LEVEL module. This kind of partitioning is commonly referred to as <b>Logical</b> <b>Partitioning.</b>|$|E
25|$|LPAR (<b>Logical</b> <b>PARtitioning),</b> {{a feature}} {{introduced}} from IBM's mainframe computers, facilitates running multiple operating systems simultaneously on one IBM System i unit. A system configured with LPAR can run various operating systems on separate partitions while ensuring that one OS cannot run over the memory or resources of another. Each LPAR {{is given a}} portion of system resources (memory, hard disk space, and CPU time) via a system of weights that determines where unused resources are allocated at any given time. The operating systems supported (and commonly used) under the LPAR scheme are IBM i, AIX, and Linux.|$|E

50|$|Also, on some systems, a large gap of unused space {{may exist}} {{between the end of}} a <b>logical</b> <b>partition</b> and the next EBR, or between the last <b>logical</b> <b>partition</b> {{and the end of the}} whole {{extended}} partition itself, if any previously created <b>logical</b> <b>partition</b> has been deleted or resized (shrunk).|$|R
50|$|An HDD {{may contain}} only one {{extended}} partition, but that extended partition can be subdivided into multiple <b>logical</b> <b>partitions.</b> DOS/Windows systems may then assign a unique drive letter to each <b>logical</b> <b>partition.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Logical</b> <b>Partitions,</b> LPARs, a {{standard}} function on ES/9000 processors, are a feature whereby IBM's Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM), allows different operating systems to run concurrently in separate <b>logical</b> <b>partitions</b> (LPARs), {{with a high}} degree of isolation.|$|R
50|$|All IBM System p5 and IBM eServer p5 {{machines}} support DLPAR (Dynamic <b>Logical</b> <b>Partitioning)</b> with Virtual I/O and Micro-partitioning.|$|E

50|$|A <b>logical</b> <b>partition,</b> {{commonly}} called an LPAR, is {{a subset of}} a computer's hardware resources, virtualized as a separate computer.

5000|$|The IBM POWER virtual SCSI client {{driver for}} Linux (ibmvscsi), {{available}} since January 2008 (kernel version 2.6.24).

50|$|The terms PR/SM and LPAR {{are often}} used interchangeably in IBM System z, {{including}} in IBM documentation. Formally, LPAR designates the <b>logical</b> <b>partitioning</b> function and mode of operation, whereas PR/SM is the commercial designation of the feature.|$|E
50|$|The {{specification}} for Power ISA v.2.04 was finalized in June 2007. It {{is based}} on Power ISA v.2.03 and includes changes primarily to the Book III-S part regarding virtualization, hypervisor functionality, <b>logical</b> <b>partitioning</b> and virtual page handling.|$|E

50|$|Windows must be {{installed}} into a primary partition (and in older systems {{this must be}} the first partition). Linux can {{be installed}} into a partition in any position on the hard drive and can also be installed into <b>logical</b> <b>partitions</b> (within the extended partition).

It allows a single physical I/O adapter {{to be used by}} multiple <b>logical</b> <b>partitions</b> on the same server. This allows consolidation of I/O servers and minimizes the amount of I/O adapters required. New concepts of shared partitioning have been implemented in the p 5 series compared to the IBM mainframe.

5000|$|Micro-Partitioning {{is a form}} of <b>logical</b> <b>partitioning</b> {{which was}} {{introduced}} by IBM on systems using the POWER5 processor, and is also referred to as a shared processor partition, and only differs from a dedicated processor partition in the way CPU utilization is configured and managed by the POWER Hypervisor (PHYP) firmware.

50|$|<b>Logical</b> <b>partitioning</b> divides {{hardware}} resources. Two LPARs may access memory from {{a common}} memory chip, provided that the ranges of addresses directly accessible to each do not overlap. One partition may indirectly control memory controlled by a second partition, but only by commanding a process in that partition. CPUs may be dedicated to a single LPAR or shared. While on Amdahl's MDF(Multiple Domain Feature) {{it was possible to}} configure an LPAR with both shared and dedicated CPUs. This is no longer possible with any mainframes flavours currently in the market.|$|E

50|$|On IBM System p POWER hardware, LPARs {{are managed}} by PHYP (the POWER Hypervisor). PHYP {{acts as a}} virtual switch between the LPARs and also handles the virtual SCSI traffic between LPARs. Micro-Partitioning {{supports}} 10 times as many LPARs as processors with fractional allocations. It was introduced with the POWER5 processor. All IBM POWER5 and POWER6 systems may be partitioned. Note that a full system partition may be defined where all resources are consumed by a single partition. System P servers with PowerVM enabled allow LPARs with shared CPUs to delegate their unused cycles into the shared pool. Dedicated processors are not available for sharing. Unused cycles become available for other partitions and are governed by the parameters specified when the LPAR is defined. Changes to a running partition can be made dynamically up to the maximum value set, {{and down to the}} minimum value set in the active profile. The changing of resource allocations without restart of the logical partition is called dynamic <b>logical</b> <b>partitioning.</b> IBM PowerVM is the licensed/purchased feature that enables the virtualization features on p4,5,6,7 series servers.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{programs}} {{are able to}} create a [...] "backup" [...] of both the primary partition table and the <b>logical</b> <b>partitions</b> in the extended partition.|$|R
50|$|Unlike primary partitions, {{which are}} all {{described}} by a single partition table within the MBR, and thus limited in number, each EBR precedes the <b>logical</b> <b>partition</b> it describes. If another <b>logical</b> <b>partition</b> follows, then the first EBR will contain an entry pointing to the next EBR; thus, multiple EBRs form a linked list. This means the number of logical drives that can be formed within an extended partition is limited only {{by the amount of}} available disk space in the given extended partition.|$|R
