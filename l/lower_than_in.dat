Including away games, a total of 666,017 people saw the Browns play, a professional football record.

30|$|Combining Table  2 and Fig.  6, it {{is obvious}} that the three methods are the worst in DMES, the second in AUA, and the best in this paper. Among them, the {{performance}} of DMES and AUA is not much different, AUA is 0.55 % <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> DMES <b>in</b> missing error, AUA is 0.06 % <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> DMES <b>in</b> redundancy error, and AUA is 1.24 % higher <b>than</b> DMES <b>in</b> accuracy. The method proposed in this paper is better than DMES and AUA, and the missing error of this method is 2.04 % <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> AUA, 2.59 % <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> DMES, 0.4 <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> AUA, and 0.46 % <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> DMES <b>in</b> redundancy error. In terms of accuracy, this method is 3.46 <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> AUA and 4.7 <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> DMES. Through numerical comparison, we can find that the proposed method has a great improvement in the performance of the three indicators, which shows that the proposed method has better road information extraction performance than DMES and AUA.|$|R

5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> unencumbered ones.|$|E

The {{active ingredient}} in the cleanser and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of benzoyl peroxide, <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> most prescription-strength acne treatments. Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|The treaty only allows {{taxation}} to {{the extent}} that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|To {{finance the}} war, the Confederate {{government}} initially issued bonds, but investment {{from the public}} never met the demands. Taxes were <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis {{did not seem to}} grasp the enormity of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies. This effect is strongest in European countries with a weak economy.|$|E
5|$|All the {{implemented}} austerity {{measures have}} helped Greece bring down its primary deficit—i.e., fiscal deficit before interest payments—from €24.7bn (10.6% of GDP) in 2009 to just €5.2bn (2.4% of GDP) in 2011, {{but as a}} side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession, which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011. The Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with −6.9%, a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28.4% <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 2005, and with 111,000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). As a result, Greeks have lost about 40% of their purchasing power {{since the start of}} the crisis, they spend 40% less on goods and services, and the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate grew from 7.5% in September 2008 to a record high of 27.9% in June 2013, while the youth unemployment rate rose from 22.0% to as high as 62%. Youth unemployment ratio hit 16.1 per cent in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, some major units were disbanded {{and a lot}} of {{equipment}} was phased out or scrapped due to a severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, the situation of the land forces was critical: the military budget was three times <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were non-operational. Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation of equipment commenced. Officially, the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.|$|E
