5|$|The Childhood Of Jack Harkaway is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from S. Bracebridge Hemyng's Jack Harkaway story series by Lloyd Lonergan, the film depicts {{the life of the}} title character. Given to the care of strangers after his birth, Jack grows up and is sent to a school at age 12. After being severely and unjustly punished by the schoolmaster, Jack runs away and comes across two thieves plotting a robbery. Jack hurries to the house and warns the mistress of the planned robbery. The robbery is foiled and the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is very grateful, but Jack's schoolmaster and his guardian arrive to take him back. She recognizes the guardian as the man who forced her to turn over Jack and turns them out of the house. The film's cast and production credits are unknown. The film was released on December 23, 1910, it was met with favorable reviews and saw a wide national release. In 1988, a severely deteriorated nitrate print of the film was known to exist and it was likely transferred to the Library of Congress archives in 1997.|$|E

25|$|Youssef Wahbi, an Egyptian {{actor and}} director, {{recognised}} the young actress's talent so he {{offered her a}} lead role in the 1946 film Malak al-Rahma (ملاك الرحمة, Angel of Mercy). The film attracted widespread media attention, and Hamama, who was only 15 at the time, became famous for her melodramatic role. In 1949, Hamama had roles in three films with Wahbi: Kursi Al-I'etraf (كرسي الاعتراف, Chair of Confession), Al-Yateematain (اليتيمتين, The Two Orphans) and Sït Al-Bayt (ست البيت, <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House).</b> All were successful films.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the cause}} of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> threw melted grease from the socket of a large {{candlestick}} into a fire grate in a lower storey {{of the house and the}} ensuing flames set alight the unswept chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken offsite by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.|$|E
25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely awkward {{position in the}} Victorian household, because she was neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E

At an early stop, the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> ordered Tubman to sweep the yard so as to {{seem to be working}} for the family. When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house. Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman during the day likely hid in these locales. Tubman only later described her routes because other fugitive slaves used them.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{accompanied}} {{the family to}} Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers. Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis and watched her son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry {{so as not to}} pass on the illness. By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in San Marcos. The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father. Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers. In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to Hawaii, where they met Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani and watched the ceremony that delivered Hawaii to the United States. The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship. Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she [...] "had an awful feeling". He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.|$|E
500|$|The film is not lost, but {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being {{the son of a}} wealthy Englishman's daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boy's mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along a country road, he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two [...] servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> who is very grateful to him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jack's guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boy's appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking 'friends.' Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lad's guardian, she realizes that he is the man to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned {{out of the house and}} Jack restored to his mother's arms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Annie Reilly {{was born}} in Ireland in 1844. She later emigrated to the United States and settled down in New York City where Reilly found {{employment}} as a servant and child's nurse. She was said to look much younger than her age and was both charming and intelligent. She spoke {{at least two or}} three languages. Once gaining the confidence of the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> most often by making [...] "a great fuss over the children", she would rob the house of its valuables, usually jewelry, sometimes leaving with sometimes as much as four to five thousand dollars. She rarely stayed in one place for long, waiting only one or two days before robbing her employers, and eventually became known up and down the Eastern seaboard. She became especially infamous in New York, Brooklyn and Philadelphia and was considered [...] "the cleverest women of her line in America".|$|E

2500|$|Wolfgang {{left home}} {{permanently}} in 1781 (see below), {{and from this}} time until 1784, Leopold lived in Salzburg with just Nannerl (now in her early thirties) and their servants. Nannerl {{had a number of}} suitors, of whom the most important was Franz Armand d'Ippold, with whom she was evidently in love. In the end she did not marry him, and {{the reason for this is}} unknown. One possibility, frequently entertained by biographers, is that the marriage was blocked by Leopold, who liked having Nannerl at home as the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> However, Halliwell [...] observes that no written evidence on this point survives and insists that we simply do not know why Nannerl married so late. Nannerl finally did marry in August 1784, at age 33. She moved to the home of her new husband, Johann Baptist Franz von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg, in the small rural town of St. Gilgen, roughly six hours journey east of Salzburg.|$|E
2500|$|Official {{conduct that}} does not invade a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy is not a [...] "search" [...] under the Fourth Amendment. The possession of contraband is not anything {{in which a person}} can have a legitimate expectation of privacy, since it is by definition illegal to possess contraband. In United States v. Place (1983), the Court had held that a dog sniff is sui generis because it discloses only {{the presence or absence of}} narcotics. By contrast, the information disclosed by the heat sensing device in Kyllo v. United States (2001) disclosed the [...] "intimate details in a home, such as at what hour each night the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> takes her daily sauna and bath." [...] People have a reasonable expectation that such information will be kept private, whereas they have no such expectation in the fact they possessed contraband. Thus, the use of a drug-sniffing dog does not intrude upon any reasonable expectation of privacy, and it was not unreasonable for the Illinois police to use the dog during the time it took them to issue a warning to Caballes.|$|E

The help, Mrs. Drudge, gravitates to the radio, oblivious to the corpse, and turns it on {{just in time for}} an overly expository police message explaining that police are searching for an escaped madman in the swamps surrounding the manor. Simon, a mysterious young man new in the neighbourhood enters the house, and it is revealed that he has dumped Felicity Cunningham for her friend Cynthia Muldoon, <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> In the audience, Birdboot has mentally done the same. Major Magnus Muldoon, Cynthia's brother-in-law, is also in love with Cynthia. Eventually Inspector Hound from the police force arrives on the scene, apparently searching for the madman, and the company finally notices the body. The company splits up to look for a man of suspicion, when Simon is left alone on stage with the body, he bends over it and seems to recognise the victim, at which point he is shot by an unknown assailant.|$|E

2500|$|Although an Egyptian man {{was free}} to marry several women at a time, and some wealthy men from Old and Middle Kingdoms did {{have more than one}} wife, monogamy was the norm. There may have been some exceptions, e.g. a Nineteenth Dynasty {{official}} stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth, even after he had become very successful (P. Leiden I 371). This may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife. Egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife. [...] "His wife X, his beloved" [...] is the standard phrase identifying wives in tomb inscriptions. The instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature, e.g. Instruction of Ptahhotep or Instruction of Any, support fidelity to monogamous marriage life, calling the wife a <b>Lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness.|$|E
2500|$|When {{brought before}} Pharaoh, Sarah said that Abram was her brother, {{and the king}} thereupon {{bestowed}} upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. [...] As a token of his love for Sarai the king deeded his entire property to her, and gave her the land of Goshen as her hereditary possession: for this reason the Israelites subsequently lived in that land. Sarai prayed to God to deliver her from the king, and He thereupon sent an angel, who struck Pharaoh whenever he attempted to touch her. Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her. According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after {{she had told him}} that she was a married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her. According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: [...] "It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house." [...] Abimelech acted likewise. Sarah is the sister of Abram by another mother and wife of Abram as described in the Hebrew Bible (the Book of Genesis). In Genesis 17:15, God changes her name to Sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael. The name Sarai uses the semitic root Šarai or law and like El has the sense of power, authority, lord, deity, natural law, law as might be expected for the <b>lady</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The Hebrew name Sarah indicates a woman of high rank (less than that of 1st wife) and is sometimes translated as [...] "princess." ...|$|E
