40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney sand drain subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any chimney drain experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney sand drain effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the wall toe but also at mid distance from toe of the wall and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a <b>local</b> <b>piping</b> failure was observed near the toe region of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a chimney drain. An increase in thickness of sand layer in chimney drain was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the toe region. Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper chimney drain configuration.

40|$|An initial {{comparison}} {{is carried out}} for the following residential space and water heating options: electric resistance heating, electrically- driven heat pumps, distribution of condenser temperature water combined with heat pumps to extract heat {{at the point of}} use, district heating via hot water from a combined heat-electric utility energy source, and individual gas furnaces. This comparison indicates that district heating is potentially competitive with conventional technologies for new urban areas. A more detailed analysis of the district heating option is undertaken to clarify its economics. Base case urban models, economic assumptions and distribution networks are defined and a computer program is developed to select optimum pipe sizes for the networks and to calculate life cycle costs. Cost optimization is carried out by considering thermal energy production costs as well as thermal conveyance costs. Because of the large number of variables entering into the cost determination, sensitivity analyses are performed {{to examine the effects of}} variations from base case assumptions. Variations in the installed pipe cost, interest rate, maintenance costs and degree of market penetra- tion are shown to have the greatest effect on energy cost. Pumping power and heat loss are found to be relatively insignificant cost items. Proper phasing of system inplementation with urban growth is shown to be very important. Initial use of temporary heat sources located near the loads coupled with implementation of only <b>local</b> <b>piping</b> networks is advantageous for present gas and oil prices if the urban growth occurs over a period of 15 - 30 years. There is shown to be an economically optimum time for conversion to a large centralized thermal energy source. Several potential institutional barriers to district heating system implementation are identified. These barriers will be more difficult to overcome than any technical or economic barriers, and success in over- coming them will determine the national significance of district heating. Given positive government efforts to overcome the institutional barriers, district heating can play a major role in the U. S. Originally presented as the author's thesis, Ph. D. in the M. I. T.

40|$|The gullies {{are deep}} {{channels}} {{opened in the}} soil by water action, {{under the influence of}} factors such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation type. This study aimed to do a gullies modeling by laser scanning method. Three gullies were selected for this study, located in the Pinheiral and Vassouras cities, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The position of the scan laser was measured with GPS. With the data could create a digital elevation model, and from this were estimated as gullies area, volume and drainage flow. Through 3 D representation was possible to observe the land slope where of gullies sites, facilitating the visualization and understanding of erosion processes. <b>Local</b> with probable <b>piping</b> presence were also identified. The modeled runoff by accumulated flow created a dense drainage network, with a main waterway which may represent a gully depth line and therefore the susceptible area to soil loss. The results obtained by laser scanning linked to study execution fast demonstrated the potential of this tool for erosion processes studies and monitoring. However, more studies are required to enable a evaluation better of tool, as for example the specific programs use to process the point cloud file type can provide digital elevation models else accurate.

40|$|The {{pipe wall}} {{thinning}} stress evaluation procedures in Code-Case N- 597 - 2 [1] of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code are essentially based on Construction Code [2] stress evaluation. Stresses in the hoop and the axial directions are evaluated separately {{to meet the}} Construction Code allowable stress. Using Construction Code rules for local pipe wall thinning stress evaluation in Class 2 & 3 piping may be too restrictive. An alternative approach {{is to use the}} limit loads of locally wall thinned pipe in conjunction with an appropriate Z-Factor and the structural factors of the ASME B&PV Section XI, Appendix C [3]. Such approach may require a combined effect of pressure, bending, axial load and torsion loads on locally thinned pipe. In this paper, the effects of bending moment and torsion on the internal pressure limit load of locally thinned straight pipes are investigated. Large strain finite element limit load analysis with elastic- perfectly plastic materials are performed for a parametric matrix of piping models with various pipe R/t ratios, flaw depths, axial and transverse flaw extents. Based on the results, the allowable pressure for axial flaws in C- 5420 of the ASME B&PV Section XI, Appendix C [3] may be used for <b>piping</b> <b>local</b> wall thinning as an alternative evaluation procedure to the current minimum pipe wall thickness evaluation procedure in th...|$|R
5000|$|Early models tend {{to offer}} a means of {{securing}} one wheel: these can be a grooved piece of concrete in the ground, a forked piece of metal into which a wheel of the bicycle is pushed, or a horizontal [...] "ladder" [...] providing positions for the front wheel of many bicycles. These are not very effective, since a thief need only detach the wheel in question from the bicycle to free {{the rest of the}} bicycle. They also do not offer much support, and a row of bicycles in this type of stand are susceptible to all being toppled in a domino effect. These types of stand are known as [...] "wheel benders" [...] among cyclists.A modern version is known as the [...] "Sheffield rack" [...] or [...] "Sheffield stand" [...] after the city of Sheffield in England where these were pioneered. These consist of a thick metal bar or tube bent into the shape of a square arch. The top part is about level with the top bar of the bicycle frame, and thus supports the bicycle and allows the frame to be secured. The origin of the racks was when the frugal citizens of Sheffield had {{to decide what to do}} with some old gas <b>piping.</b> <b>Local</b> cyclists suggested the cycle rack idea and two simple bends later, and a little concrete in the ground, the rack was born. At the time this was a revolution in a world of 'single-point holders' that bent wheels and offered little lockability for frames. A version of this design feature a second, lower horizontal bar to support smaller bikes (this version is also known as “A stand”), and are coated to reduce their surface hardness and to not scratch the bike's paintwork.Since 1984 the City of Toronto has installed post and ring bicycle racks consisting of a steel bollard or post topped by a cast aluminium ring. In August 2006, it became publicly known that these stands could be defeated by prying the ring off with a two-by-four.|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{electric}} utilities in the US {{have tended to}} discourage the deployment of cogeneration installations in their own service territory because the resulting electricity sales reduction would be greater than normal load growth, and thus {{there would be a}} negative impact on earnings. For an island-based utility such as Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo) that is experiencing strong load growth, however, the situation is quite different. ? There is a need to provide new electrical resources on a continuing basis. ? There is a need to support the manufacturing sector, to help to grow the economy. ? There are no indigenous fuels; expensive imported fuel oil is virtually the only energy source available. Cogeneration is recognized as a proven technology that provides an economical, efficient, and environmental friendly way to increase electricity supply in appropriately sized increments. By facilitating, cogeneration installations and sharing in their ownership, the utility can protect-and under some circumstances even increase its overall revenue stream. The basic concept is as follows: a JPSCo-owned Cogeneration Plant will supply: (1) electricity to the JPSCo grid, and (2) ""energy products"" (such as chilled water, steam, or hot water, and perhaps compressed air) to manufacturing businesses operating within a specific geographic area. Some non-manufacturing facilities in the same area may also be served. The ""energy products"" would be supplied via a <b>local</b> District Energy <b>piping</b> network. The large manufacturing entities who are customers for one of more of the ""energy products"" would be billed for electricity supplied by JPSCo under an new Industrial Park Tariff that is about 10 - 15 % lower than the standard tariff. Ideally, the price charged for each of the ""energy products"" would be competitive with each customer's total cost to produce the same product on-site, or as a minimum each customer's total annual cost for electricity and fuel would be lower. The results of a feasibility study of the concept using data for a specific Industrial Park will be presented in this paper. The rated net electrical capacity of the cogeneration plant is 15 MW (four 4 MW medium-speed diesel engines serve as prime movers.) A total of eight industrial plants are served with electricity, chilled water, and steam. ...|$|R
