40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{describes}} the impact of an innovative higher education initiative called the <b>Learning</b> <b>City</b> Classroom, a project based on the presupposition that the classroom can raise awareness, foster solidarity and construct a collective identity consistent with {{being part of the}} sustainability movement. The <b>Learning</b> <b>City</b> Classroom is portrayed as an organizing, designing and implementation entity and as having all the qualities of an emerging social movement organization. The <b>Learning</b> <b>City</b> acts as a social movement organization by identifying shared objectives as critical to the sustainability movement. The outcome of this research shows not only that the university can support the sustainability social movement in concrete and tangible ways, but also, that it can do this in ways that are empowering for grassroots community groups as well as for students...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Individual {{earnings}} are higher in bigger cities. We consider three reasons: spatial sorting of initially more productive workers, static advantages from workers ’ current location, and learning by working in bigger cities. Using rich administrative data for Spain, {{we find that}} workers in bigger cities do not have higher initial ability as reflected in fixed-effects. Instead, they obtain an immediate static premium and accumulate more valuable experience. The additional value of experience in bigger cities persists after leaving and is stronger for those with higher initial ability. This explains both the higher mean and greater dispersion of earnings in bigger cities.

40|$|Lifelong {{education}} in Korea {{grew out of}} the Lifelong Education Act, which was enacted in 2000. To promote lifelong learning for citizens, states and local governments supported educational facilities and encouraged various organizations and businesses to strengthen their support for continuing education. After the Lifelong Education Act was enacted, a lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>city</b> project, the Lifelong Learning Center, supporting lifelong learning for the disadvantaged, was established along with a Cyber University, and a National Lifelong Learning Festival was held as {{part of the process of}} expanding the lifelong learning system. In this paper, the governmental lifelong learning policies such as promoting lifelong learning opportunities, the lifelong learning atmosphere, the recognition of lifelong learning outcomes, enhancing the role of lifelong learning institutions and promoting lifelong learning system maintenance are analyzed. Currently, the policy effectiveness, adequacy, equity, responsiveness and appropriateness are evaluated as satisfactory to meet the policy goals. However, the policy level seems to be relatively lower than the other factors. Within the areas of different policies, most of the areas of lifelong learning have been shown to be effective. In particular, supporting disadvantaged groups, the lifelong <b>learning</b> <b>city</b> project, the academic credit bank system and managing lifelong learning centers were evaluated to be extremely effective. On the other hand, the need to reconstruct and integrate the academic credit bank system and self-learning degree system was raised. In the future, the business of improving the role of lifelong educational institutions needs to be further developed and managed. In addition, efforts for activating lifelong education and raising the effi ciency of lifelong learning should be made with connections among various organizations...|$|E

Through the range of local resources they bring together, Learning Cities can provide local solutions to local challenges (Kearns, 1999 : 6). This paper presents some preliminary findings from work in progress, the Eurolocal project – European activities on the local and regional dimension of Lifelong Learning. Through this work the project aims to help create and reinforce Learning Regions throughout Europe and expand peoples vision to help a Region achieve its potential. The use of the terms ‘Learning City’, ‘Learning Town’, ‘Learning Region ’ and ‘Learning Community ’ is rapidly becoming commonplace in the European lifelong learning debate. The European Commission has supported several projects and programmes to create learn-ing regions notably the Socrates R 3 L programme, the TELS, LILLIPUT, INDICATORS, PALLACE, LILARA and PENR 3 L projects. Other initiatives also recognise the value of lifelong learning, however little work has been completed to synthesise all this knowledge, nor to disseminate it as a coherent whole to those who would benefit from it.

40|$|In this article, we seek {{to assess}} {{the extent to which}} adult and lifelong {{learning}} policies and practices in Asia have distinctiveness by comparison to those found in western societies, through an analysis of inter-governmental, national and regional policies in the field. We also inform our study through the analysis of the work of organisations with an international remit with a specific focus on Asia and Europe. In one case, the Asia–Europe Meeting Lifelong Learning (ASEM LLL) Hub has a specific function of bringing together researchers in Asia and Europe. In another, the PASCAL Observatory has had a particular focus on one aspect of lifelong learning, that of learning cities, with a concentration in its work on Asia and Europe. We focus on <b>learning</b> <b>city</b> development as a particular case of distinction in the field. We seek to identify the extent to which developments in the field in Asia have influenced and have been influenced by practices elsewhere in world, especially in Europe, and undertake our analysis using theories of societal learning/the learning society, learning communities and life-deep learning.

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} that a commitment by a community to improve access to lifelong learning opportunities as a <b>Learning</b> <b>City</b> enhances {{the quality of life}} of its citizens and improves its economic conditions through a more creative, stable and adaptable community. In May 2000, the newly elected Labor Government in Victoria launched the Victorian &# 039;Learning Towns&# 039; Program. Based on a United Kingdom (UK) model that had been developing since 1995 with demonstrable success, the nine (and later, ten) rural and regional cities and towns in the Victorian pilot program were the first in Australia to receive funding to support lifelong learning as an approach towards achieving sustainable economic development and social inclusiveness. This research focused on the practice and progress of SmartGeelong - The Leaming City, one of the pilot programs. It presented an opportunity to evaluate the economic and social development of a community that has declared itself a <b>Learning</b> <b>City</b> by posing the following research questions: 1. What are the key characteristics of a Leaming City and what determines these? 2. What are the value added outcomes? How can the depth and breadth of participation be entrenched? 3. What are the indicators of success and effectiveness in a Leaming City? Having made this observation however, the capacity for the cultural change in an ACE driven learning community to be sustainable is likely to be limited unless it engages local government in meaningful ways to ensure that those changes are long term. Currently, the contribution by local government to learning communities in Australia is varied and can be erratic. The experience in the UK supports the observation in Australian learning communities that where there is a commitment that is understood by local government, it is possible to improve social inclusion and local economic performance. This research has concluded that its most significant finding is the effectiveness of the neutral space that a concept such as the Leaming City provides. By providing a conceptual space that is non threatening, non competitive and belongs to the whole community rather than any one organisation, it is possible to develop cross sectoral partnerships among organisations that may be competitors in other environments, that add value to communities, overcome barriers and develop creative responses that address local issues and build community capacity. The research describes the experience of building a learning community, of lessons learned and insights gained. Through example, it provides a foundation for other communities that may be interested in pursuing this concept. However, while it is possible to develop a learning community through the commitment and initiative of local leaders, it is made more difficult in the absence of a national policy commitment to lifelong learning. Despite this, the research concludes that through the careful development and nurturing of all partners, the process of developing a learning community is effective, sustainable and makes a positive impact...|$|E
