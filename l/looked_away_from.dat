2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, {{and as soon as he}} was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (Mr. Phillips) to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while he was doing this a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
