25|$|The Centers for Disease Control traced {{outbreaks}} of agranulocytosis among cocaine users, in the US and Canada between March 2008 and November 2009, {{to the presence}} of <b>levamisole</b> in the drug supply. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that, as of February 2010, 71% of seized cocaine lots coming into the US contained <b>levamisole</b> as a cutting agent. <b>Levamisole</b> is an antihelminthic (i.e. deworming) drug used in animals. The reason for adding <b>levamisole</b> to cocaine is unknown, although it can be due to their similar melting points and solubilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Levamisole,</b> {{which is}} a common {{adulterant}} of cocaine, can cause an ANCA positive vasculitis.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, mebendazole, <b>levamisole,</b> or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, <b>levamisole</b> and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, <b>levamisole</b> and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
500|$|Goldstein {{was found}} dead in his New York City {{apartment}} on August 28, 2009. Drug paraphernalia, including a crack pipe and a bag of crack, were found nearby. The New York medical examiner subsequently determined that Goldstein's death was an accident caused by [...] "acute intoxication" [...] from a combination of cocaine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diphenhydramine and <b>levamisole.</b> Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{suppresses}} {{the production}} of white blood cells, resulting in neutropenia and agranulocytosis. With {{the increasing use of}} <b>levamisole</b> as an adulterant, a number of these complications have been reported among cocaine users. <b>Levamisole</b> has also been linked to a risk of vasculitis, and two cases of vasculitic skin necrosis have been reported in users of cocaine adulterated with <b>levamisole.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> Induced Necrosis Syndrome (LINES) is a {{complication}} of adulterated cocaine recognized in 2011, {{caused by the}} use of <b>levamisole</b> as a cutting agent for cocaine.|$|E
50|$|The Centers for Disease Control traced {{outbreaks}} of agranulocytosis among cocaine users, in the US and Canada between March 2008 and November 2009, {{to the presence}} of <b>levamisole</b> in the drug supply. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that, as of February 2010, 71% of seized cocaine lots coming into the US contained <b>levamisole</b> as a cutting agent. <b>Levamisole</b> is an antihelminthic (i.e. deworming) drug used in animals. The reason for adding <b>levamisole</b> to cocaine is unknown, although it can be due to their similar melting points and solubilities.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{testing of}} racehorse urine {{has led to}} the revelation that among <b>levamisole</b> equine {{metabolites}} are both pemoline and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities. Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize <b>levamisole</b> into aminorex. The stimulant properties of aminorex contribute to the use of <b>levamisole</b> as a cocaine adulterant, potentiating the reinforcing effects of cocaine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{is readily}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5-2 hours. The plasma elimination half-life is fairly quick at 3-4 hours which {{can contribute to}} not detecting <b>Levamisole</b> intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged <b>levamisole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{toxicity}} is a vasculitis {{that can}} appear similar to frostbite. It {{is caused by}} contamination of cocaine by <b>levamisole.</b> Skin lesions can look similar those of frostbite, but do not require cold exposure to occur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Levamisole</b> was {{originally}} {{used as an}} anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. <b>Levamisole</b> works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. In countries that still {{permit the use of}} <b>levamisole,</b> the recommended dose for anthelmintic therapy is a single dose, with a repeated dose 7 days later if needed for a severe hookworm infection. [...] Most current commercial preparations are intended for veterinary use as a dewormer in cattle, pigs, and sheep. However, <b>levamisole</b> has also recently gained prominence among aquarists as an effective treatment for Camallanus roundworm infestations in freshwater tropical fish.|$|E
50|$|Cocaine {{use with}} {{concomitant}} {{use of the}} one-time chemotherapy drug and now veterinary deworming agent <b>levamisole</b> can cause purpura of the ears, face, trunk, or extremities, sometimes needing reconstructive surgery. <b>Levamisole</b> is purportedly a common cutting agent.|$|E
50|$|US Drug Enforcement Administration {{and state}} testing {{laboratories}} report {{that more than}} 70% of the illicit cocaine analyzed in July 2009 was positive for <b>levamisole,</b> an antiparasitic drug used by veterinarians to treat worm infestations. This represents an increase over previous reports indicating that <b>levamisole</b> contaminated only 30% of cocaine seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration from July to September 2008. Furthermore, a recent analysis found that almost 80% of the individuals who test positive for cocaine also test positive for <b>levamisole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Piperazine salts, <b>levamisole</b> and benzimidazoles are all {{reported}} treatments.|$|E

50|$|After {{being pulled}} from {{the market in the}} U.S. and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, <b>levamisole</b> has been tested in {{combination}} with fluorouracil to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both <b>levamisole</b> and tetramisole showed similar effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> has {{increasingly}} {{been used as}} a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the USA. In 2008 - 2009, <b>levamisole</b> was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). By April 2011, the DEA reported the adulterant was found in 82% of seizures.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} serious side effects of <b>levamisole</b> is agranulocytosis, or the {{depletion}} of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08-5% of the studied populations. There have also been reports of <b>levamisole</b> induced necrosis syndrome in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole,</b> {{which is}} a common {{adulterant}} of cocaine, can cause an ANCA positive vasculitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> was {{discovered}} in 1966. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.18 to 0.33 USD for a course of treatment. It is not commercially available in the United States. <b>Levamisole</b> is also used as a dewormer for livestock.|$|E
50|$|Albendazole is very {{effective}} on the microfilariae. Hetrazan, tetramisole and <b>levamisole</b> are most commonly used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A post mortem blood <b>levamisole</b> concentration of 2.2 mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose.|$|E
50|$|Levamisole-tainted cocaine {{was linked}} to several {{high-profile}} deaths. Toxicology reports showed <b>levamisole,</b> along with cocaine, was present in DJ AM's body {{at the time of}} his death. Andrew Koppel, son of newsman Ted Koppel, was also found with <b>levamisole</b> in his body after his death was ruled a drug overdose. More recently it has also been suspected in the death of a Sydney teenager.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{has been}} used to treat a variety of {{dermatologic}} conditions, including skin infections, leprosy, warts, lichen planus, and aphthous ulcers.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{in cases}} of {{hematuria}} or cystitis is made by finding eggs in the urine sediment. Successful treatment with <b>levamisole,</b> ivermectin or fenbendazole has been reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Ergamisol among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} parasitic worm infections. Specifically it is used for ascariasis and hookworm infections. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{used as an}} {{adulterant}} in cocaine {{has resulted}} in 20 confirmed or probable cases of agranulocytosis, including 2 deaths, according to an alert from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.|$|E
50|$|This {{chemical}} {{was tested}} {{for its ability}} to kill parasitic nematodes, It was found to be more effective than <b>levamisole,</b> a synthetic drug used to kill parasitic worms and to treat colon cancer.|$|E
50|$|Imidazothiazoles are bicyclic heterocycles {{consisting}} of an imidazole ring fused to a thiazole ring; any derivative of this compound, especially {{one that is}} any of a class of anthelmintics such as butamisole or <b>levamisole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Crack cocaine as sold on {{the streets}} may be {{adulterated}} or [...] "cut" [...] with other substances mimicking the appearance of crack cocaine to increase bulk. Use of toxic adulterants such as <b>levamisole</b> has been documented.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, some nematocides use {{to prevent}} the disease. For example, morantel, mesulfenfos, <b>levamisole,</b> emamectin, milbemectin, thionazin. Some biopesticides are studying, but they remain expelimental stage. Inoculte {{nematode}} and nematophagous fungus same pine timber, the nematode decrease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levamisole</b> {{has become}} a common {{additive}} to illicit cocaine. It is thought to intensify the “high” by releasing dopamine in the brain, it also acts as a bulking agent and, finally is a difficult adulterant to recognize. Potential risks of levamisole-laced cocaine include neutropenia, agranulocytosis, arthralgias, retiform purpura, skin necrosis, and fever. The skin necrosis associated with <b>levamisole</b> toxicity ranges from leukocytoclastic vasculitis to occlusive vasculopathy. Several cases of severe agranulocytosis associated with cocaine use have been reported since 2006. With the recently recognized dermal disease, the face and ears are commonly affected, especially the bilateral helices and cheeks. However, {{there have also been}} case reports of involvement of the abdomen, chest, lower buttocks and legs.|$|E
50|$|The proper {{diagnosis}} of acanthocephaliasis in humans is made through fecal analysis, which if the host is infected should contain adult worms or eggs. To obtain the worms from the host, piperazine citrate, <b>levamisole</b> and bithionol can be {{administered to the}} patient.|$|E
