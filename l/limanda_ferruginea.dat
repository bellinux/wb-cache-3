There was a pronounced declining trend in the onset of maturation in males but no directed trend in females. Increased growth of a cohort over its lifetime, increased growth in the year prior to maturation, increased mortality in adults and increased bottom temperatures all appear to exert some effect on maturation of one or both sexes. Population abundance did not appear to have any direct effect even though there has been a substantial decline in abundance during the study period which led to the implementation of a directed fishery moratorium in 1994.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{importance of}} the Yellowtail Flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea</b> Storer) {{in recent years has}} greatly increased, partly because of the greater use of otter trawlers in North American waters, and also {{as a response to the}} unprecedented demand for fish products during the war. This is particularly true in the case of Canada where, until recently, the traditional method of fishing was line trawling, a method which prevented the capture of yellowtails since its mouth is so small that one is rarely caught on the large hooks used for cod, haddock, and pollock. These factors have led to an extensive exploitation of the yellowtail fisheries, especially in New England waters where, in 1942, more than 65, 000, 000 pounds of yellowtails were landed. Since then yellowtail landings in New England have steadily decreased, although the fishing intensity has increased, and there are indications that this decrease may be the result of over-fishing. The position of the yellowtail upon the Canadian market, although much less important, is becoming increasingly significant. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|For the {{commercial}} fishing industry, efficiency and sustainability are {{key aspects of}} business. Knowing when and where to harvest, along with the environmental traits associated with good fishing grounds, minimizes costly fuel and time spent searching for fish.

This study investigates temporal and spatial patterns in the catch rates of yellowtail flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> recorded by factory freezer trawlers operating on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The temporal analysis revealed that commercial catch rates are higher at night as well as during winter and summer. The findings suggest that ambient light levels and environmental factors are important for successful yellowtail flounder- trawl interactions. Spatial analysis is used to show the interactions between environmental variables and yellowtail flounder catch rates.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a method to objectively measure and characterize the size and location of discolouration patterns that are currently observed in the fillets of commercially harvested yellowtail flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> on the east coast of Canada. To accomplish this, an image processing program was developed to analyse fillet discolouration patterns. Total discoloured area and percent fillet coverage were measured and compared to total bruise weight and percent bruise weight attained from manual assessment. Results revealed that bruising was evident in 86. 5 % of the fish sampled. Of all the parameters measured, fish weight was the only parameter correlated with bruise weight. Bruise area ranged from 0 to 124. 5 cm 2, with a mean of 12. 1 cm 2 (s. d. = 21. 4), and accounted for an average of 4. 3 % of fillet area. Bruises were not uniformly distributed on any of the fillet sides.

From these releases, 3767 of the tags were recovered. The primary objectives of this tagging program were to evaluate the mortality and large-scale movement of Yellowtail Flounder among 3 stock areas in New England. To explore mortality, survival and recovery rate were estimated from traditional Brownie tag-recovery models fitted to the data with Program MARK. Models were examined with time and sex-dependent parameters over several temporal scales. The models with a monthly scale for both survival and recovery rate had the best overall fit and returned parameter estimates that were biologically reasonable. Estimates of survival from the tag-recovery models confirm the general magnitude of total mortality derived from age-based stock assessments but indicate that survival was greater for females than for males. In addition to calculating mortality estimates, we examined the pattern of release and recapture locations and revealed frequent movements within stock areas and less frequent movement among stock areas. The collaboration of fishermen and scientists for this study successfully resulted in independent confirmation of previously documented patterns of movement and mortality rates from conventional age-based analyses...|$|E

Observations were conducted with a high-definition camera attached at the center of the headline of a trawl, during the brightest time of day in June 2010 off eastern Newfoundland. Behavioral responses were quantified and analyzed to evaluate predictions related to fish behavior, orientation, and capture. Individuals showed 3 different initial responses independent of fish size, gait, and fish density: they swam close to (75 %), were herded away from (19 %), or moved vertically away from (6 %) the seabed. Individuals primarily swam in the direction of initial orientation. No fish were oriented against the trawling direction. Fish in the center of the trawl mouth tended to swim along the bottom in the trawling direction. Only individuals that were stimulated to leave the bottom were caught. Individuals in peripheral locations within the trawl mouth more often swam inward and upward. Fish that swam inward were twice as likely to be caught.

Analyses of the substitutional spectrum reveals a bias favouring the occurrence of transitions over transversions. Furthermore, transitions between C and T and transversions between A and C or T are more frequent than transitions or transversions involving G. COI sequence composition shows a bias against the occurrence of G and a preference for A at the third position of fourfold degenerate codons.

The present study investigated the micro-scopic morphology and histochemistry (total and neutral lipids, glycogen) of liver tissue of wild (3 +) and cultured (1 +) sexually immature female and male yel-lowtail flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea</b> Storer), sampled in late April 2001. Hepatosomatic indices [HSI: (liver weight/body weight) liver weight) · 100] of cultured fish {{were significantly higher than}} those of wild fish. Females in the cultured group had significantly lower HSIs than males. The liver of both wild and cultured L. ferruginea was interspersed with pancreatic tissue. The main com-ponents of the liver tissue were irregular cords of he-patocytes arranged in tubules which surrounded vascular sinusoids. The hepatocytes contained an abundance of lipid, much of which appeared to be neutral lipids, in both sexes of the cultured fish. Total and neutral lipid droplets were larger, and the area occupied by these droplets was significantly greater in both cultured females and males compared to the wild fish, suggesting lipidosis in the cultured fish. In the cul-tured fish these differences were sex-dependent, the fe-males having significantly more total and neutral lipids in hepatocytes than the males. This suggests a poten-tially greater storage capacity in females and/or a higher lipid metabolism in males.

S. waters and those sampled off Newfoundland, but little morphometric variation among samples from U. S. areas. Collaborative genetic analysis also found little variation among U. S. samples. Yellowtail flounder resources off the U. S. appear to be a single genetic stock, but significant variation in life history attributes and different patterns of abundance over time suggest that yellowtail flounder off the northeastern U. S. should be managed as three stocks: Cape Cod-Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and southern New England-Mid Atlantic. ...|$|E
40|$|Stock-rebuilding time {{isopleths}} relate constant {{levels of}} fishing mortality (F), stock biomass, and management goals to rebuilding times for overfished stocks. We used simulation models with uncertainty about FMSY and variability in annual intrinsic growth rates (ry) to calculate rebuilding time isopleths for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, <b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea,</b> and cowcod rockfish, Sebastes levis, in the Southern California Bight. Stock-rebuilding time distributions from stochastic models were variable and right-skewed, indicating that rebuilding may take less or substantially {{more time than}} expected. The probability of long rebuilding times increased with lower biomass, higher F, uncertainty about FMSY, and autocorrelation in ry values. Uncertainty about FMSY had the greatest effect on rebuilding times. Median recovery times from simulations were insensitive to model assumptions about uncertainty and variability, suggesting that median recovery times {{should be considered in}} rebuilding plans. Isopleths calculated in previous studies by deterministic models approximate median, rather than mean, rebuilding times. Stochastic models allow managers to specify and evaluate the risk (measured as a probability) of not achieving a rebuilding goal according to schedule. Rebuilding time isopleths can be used for stocks with a range of life histories and can be based on any type of population dynamics model. They are directly applicable with constant F rebuilding plans but are also useful in other cases. We used new algorithms for simulating autocorrelated process errors from a gamma distribution and evaluated sensitivity to statistical distributions assumed for ry. Uncertainty about current biomass and fishing mortality rates can be considered with rebuilding time isopleths in evaluating and designing constant-F rebuilding plans...|$|E
40|$|Yellowtail {{flounder}} (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> {{is currently}} assessed using a stock-production model. The {{goal is to}} replace this model with an age-structured model; however validation {{studies show that the}} current method for ageing older fish is inaccurate and re-ageing the historical collection of otoliths in its entirety is not possible. Therefore our objective is to determine the minimum number of otoliths that need to be re-aged to generate a valid age-length key from a subsample of the full collection. All otoliths (n = 1747) from the 1998 spring and fall research surveys were re-aged, and used to build all-year full data age-length matrices (FDALM). These FDALM's were considered “target keys ” for which we implemented a subsampling routine to reproduce them from samples of smaller sizes. Random subsamples (without replication) of different sizes were taken from the corresponding full databases, and subsampled age-length matrices (SSALM) were produced, and compared with the corresponding FDALM using a bidimensional two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We used the obtained p-values as a measure of the similarity between the keys. To assess variability, random sampling was performed 400 times at each subsample size, and the median and 95 th percentile range of the p-values were obtained. We used plots of the median p-values against subsample size to determine the size that produces the desired similarity with the full sample (i. e. a median p-value close to one with small variability). Our results indicate that small sample sizes (less than 10 % of the full sample) generated non-significant differences between the SSALM and FDALM but with large variability, while subsample sizes around 60 % of the full sample were similar enough to be considered adequate...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{seasonal}} and daily movements of some shallow water benthic marine species in a small, rock bounded "gulch" of variable depth in Logy Bay, Newfoundland, revealed that {{two species of}} sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius and M. octodecemspinosus were the most common fish inhabitants of the area. M. octodecemspinosus dominated the area's fish fauna during the summer months. Although M. scorpius was a year round inhabitant of the area, its population was greatly decreased in the winter. Analyses of distribution patterns for these two species indicated that M. octodecemspinosus ranged through the depth gradient of the gulch and occupied various types of open bottom terrain. M. scorpius was {{more common in the}} lower reaches of the gulch and was associated with cover throughout the summer months. This cryptic behaviour subsided during the winter months subsequent to the fall emigration of M. octodecemspinosus from the area. [...] Stepwise multiple regression and correlation analyses of the numbers of M. scorpius, M. octodecemspinosus and Stichaeus punctatus per unit area suggested that, of the physical and biological parameters examined, photoperiod, temperature and the degree of water movement were correlated with the abundance of these benthic fish species in the study area. Linear prediction models of abundance of M. scorpius, M. octodecemspinosus and S. punctatus per unit area are presented. Deficiencies of these models are discussed. [...] Observations of M. scorpius and M. octodecemspinosus at night suggest interspecific avoidance by reciprocal movements {{into and out of the}} study area at dawn and dusk. The numbers of M. scorpius present in the study area decreased at dusk and increased again at dawn. [...] Pseudopleuronectes americanus was abundant in the area from late May to September. A dense aggregation of P. americanus observed after dark in late June is described. [...] Times of immigration and emigration of <b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea</b> were similar to those of P. americanus...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how animals select {{habitat is}} {{important}} for conservation and for management of exploited species such as marine fish. Three theories of habitat use have been proposed for marine fishes, the Constant Density Model, the Proportional Density Model, and the Basin Model. Each makes different predictions {{of changes in the}} occupied range and fitness of a species as the population grows. The Constant Density Model predicts that local population density is constant and the range occupied by the species expands as the population grows. Fitness is dependent on location and not on population size. The Proportional Density Model maintains that range does not change and that local population density is a fixed proportion of the whole. As in the Constant Density Model, fitness is site dependent and not population size. The Basin Model predicts that both range and local population density change with increases in global population size and that fitness is inversely correlated with population size. ^ I have examined patterns of habitat use at three different spatial scales, using three different species at different life history stages to determine whether the patterns of habitat use are consistent with the Constant Density Model, the Proportional Density Model, or the Basin Model. I have looked at habitat use in juvenile fish in the nearshore zone, spawning habitat selection by winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), and the distribution of yellowtail flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> on Georges Bank. ^ Two habitats in the nearshore zone were identified by the different assemblages of juvenile fishes they contained. One of the species in the assemblage (Tautoga onitis) expanded their range when populations were higher. Fitness, as measured by growth rate, was not significantly different in the two habitats. Spawning habitat for winter flounder in Milford and New Haven Harbors seemed to be more related to current patterns rather than substrate type or depth. Egg mortality rate, a proxy for fitness, was higher in Milford Harbor. I found evidence of range expansion and, site dependent habitat use, and density dependent habitat use in the yellowtail flounder population on Georges Bank. ...|$|E
40|$|Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (2002 - 2011) were {{analyzed}} to examine evolution {{patterns in the}} Southern of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3 NO) groundfish assemblage structure in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. The fish biodiversity results (221 fish species) are higher than in other ecosystems, and the highest value is reached in the deeper assemblage, with diversity H= 2. 23. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous although there were more-abrupt changes at 300 m. Three main groups and five assemblages were identified. Cluster I (Shallow) comprised the strata with depths lesser than 300 m; cluster II (Intermediate) contained the depth strata between 301 and 1000 m and cluster III (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Cluster I could be further subdivided into two sub-clusters. Cluster Ia comprised the strata with depth less than 150 m and cluster Ib the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m. Two sub-cluster were identified in cluster II: IIa contained depths between 301 m and 600 m and IIb depths between 601 and 1000 m. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition assemblages seem {{to be similar to}} the previous period. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacement of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> appears to be as the dominant species in shallow assemblages instead of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; in the intermediate assemblages redfish (Sebastes spp) is the dominant species. The evolution pattern in the fish assemblages in the Southern Grand Banks is similar to other Northwest Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{yellowtail}} flounder (<b>Limanda</b> <b>ferruginea)</b> once considered a prime candidate for aquaculture, were photothermally manipulated {{in an attempt}} to advance the ovulation time of females of this species. The success of these techniques would be highly beneficial to the broodstock management of {{yellowtail flounder}}. [...] Two groups of female yellowtail flounder were held under compressed photothermal environmental laboratory conditions as an attempt to advance ovulation and spawning time. One group was administered a controlled release gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) in February, the other group was administered a sham pellet in an identical manner. A third group of fish was held under ambient photoperiod and temperature conditions. The experiment ran for two years using a different group of animals for each year. In year two, a sub-group (five females) of the ambient control fish was given a GnRH-a pellet in February. In year one a total of 6 females were used in each of the photothermally advanced group. In year two this number was increased to twelve in both photothermally treated groups. [...] Throughout annual reproductive development the degree of advancement of the females was monitored using both ovarian cannulation and plasma steroids (estradiol- 17 P and testosterone) analysis. No significant advancement was noted in either of the photothermal manipulated groups in the oocyte diameters obtained through the cannulation or in steroid levels. [...] Advanced spawning in the group photothermally manipulated and administered the GnRH-a pellet (PP-GnRH-a) was noted in March in both year one and two. The photothermally manipulated group receiving the sham pellet (PP-Sham) did not spawn in advance of the ambient control group. Egg quality parameters, based on egg viability, fertilization and hatch rates, for the PP-GnRH-a group were excellent and were significantly higher than the PP-Sham group for viability and fertilization. Egg quality for the PP-GnRH-a group was not significantly different from the ambient group of females. The PP-Sham and control group both spawned in June, which is the expected ambient spawning time for yellowtail flounder in captive conditions. A single female from the ambient group administered the GnRH-a pellet in February spawned, however egg and larval quality was extremely poor, and larvae produced from this female did not survive for more than one day post hatch. [...] Further investigation is required to determine an appropriate way to advance ovulation in the yellowtail flounder using environmental cues, and to improve on general broodstock husbandry of this species...|$|E
