The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI {{circuits}} by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers. By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM) and three <b>low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.|$|E

5000|$|Bipolar {{integrated}} circuits generally have higher radiation tolerance than CMOS circuits. The <b>low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> (LS) 5400 series can withstand 1000 krad, and many ECL devices can withstand 10 000 krad.|$|E

50|$|The German {{physicist}} Walter H. Schottky formulated {{a theory}} predicting the Schottky effect, {{which led to}} the Schottky diode and later Schottky transistors. For the same power dissipation, Schottky transistors have a faster switching speed than conventional transistors because the Schottky diode prevents the transistor from saturating and storing charge; see Baker clamp. Gates built with Schottky transistors use more power than normal TTL and switch faster. With <b>Low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> (LS), internal resistance values were increased to reduce power consumption and increase switching speed over the original version. The introduction of Advanced <b>Low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> (ALS) further increased speed and reduced power consumption. A faster logic family called FAST (Fairchild Advanced Schottky TTL) (Schottky) (F) was also introduced that was faster than normal Schottky TTL.|$|E

40|$|Failure {{modes of}} bipolar Schottky logic devices due to {{metallurgical}} degradation of PtSi/Ti-W/Al contacts were studied. Both {{to the purpose}} prepared wafers and commercial 74 LSOO TTL <b>Low-Power</b> <b>Schottky</b> devices were used. Metallurgical failures are primarily due to Al diffusion through the Ti-W barrier layer. As a consequence, thermal treatments induce electrical failures which begin {{with a loss of}} fan-out followed by longer rise and fall switching times. Finally complete device failure is observed when the output stays always at the high logic level. Emitter-base leakages and short-circuits, due to Si dissolution in the overlaying metal system, can explain the observed electrical degradations which are markedly delayed by a thin oxygen layer present at the Al/Ti-W interface...|$|E

To avoid the occurrence and propagation of effects of single event upset (SEU) bit state changes induced by the bombardments attempts were made to harden the Galileo electronics against SEUs. The hazards are especially acute for Schottky diode and <b>low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> TTL parts. The preventive action options which were scheduled are reviewed, noting the selection of CMOS chips as replacements for SEU-susceptible devices.

The device is specified {{in compliance with}} JEDEC standard no. 7 A. The 74 HC 4051; 74 HCT 4051 is an 8 -channel analog multiplexer/demultiplexer with three digital select inputs (S 0 to S 2), an active-LOW enable input (E), eight independent inputs/outputs (Y 0 to Y 7) and a common input/output (Z). With E LOW, {{one of the eight}} switches is selected (low impedance ON-state) by S 0 to S 2. With E HIGH, all switches are in the high-impedance OFF-state, independent of S 0 to S 2. VCC and GND are the supply voltage pins for the digital control inputs (S 0 to S 2, and E). The VCC to GND ranges are 2. 0 V to 10. 0 V for 74 HC 4051 and 4. 5 V to 5. 5 V for 74 HCT 4051.

40|$|The 74 HC 237 is a {{high-speed}} Si-gate CMOS device and is pin compatible with <b>low-power</b> <b>Schottky</b> TTL (LSTTL). The 74 HC 237 is specified {{in compliance with}} JEDEC standard no. 7 A. The 74 HC 237 is a 3 -to- 8 line decoder, demultiplexer with latches at the three address inputs (An). The 74 HC 237 essentially combines the 3 -to- 8 decoder function with a 3 -bit storage latch. When the latch is enabled (LE = LOW), the 74 HC 237 acts as a 3 -to- 8 active LOW decoder. When the latch enable (LE) goes from LOW-to-HIGH, the last data present at the inputs before this transition, is stored in the latches. Further address changes are ignored as long as LE remains HIGH. The output enable input (E 1 and E 2) controls {{the state of the}} outputs independent of the address inputs or latch operation. All outputs are HIGH unless E 1 is LOW and E 2 is HIGH. The 74 HC 237 is ideally suited for implementing non-overlapping decoders in 3 -state systems and strobed (stored address) applications in bus-oriented systems. 2.

It is specified {{in compliance with}} JEDEC standard No. 7 -A. The 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 is {{a high-speed}} 8 -bit addressable latch designed for general purpose storage applications in digital systems. It is a multifunctional device capable of storing single-line data in eight addressable latches and providing a 3 -to- 8 decoder and multiplexer function with active HIGH outputs (Q 0 to Q 7). It also incorporates an active LOW common reset (MR) for resetting all latches {{as well as an}} active LOW enable input (LE). The 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 has four modes of operation: • In the addressable latch mode, data on the data line (D) is written into the addressed latch. The addressed latch will follow the data input with all non-addressed latches remaining in their previous states. • In the memory mode, all latches remain in their previous states and are unaffected by the data or address inputs. • In the 3 -to- 8 decoding or demultiplexing mode, the addressed output follows the state of the data input (D) with all other outputs in the LOW state. • In the reset mode, all outputs are LOW and unaffected by the address inputs (A 0 to A 2) and data input (D). When operating the 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 as an address latch, changing more than one bit of the address could impose a transient-wrong address. Therefore, this should only be done while in the memory mode. ■ Balanced propagation delays ■ All inputs have Schmitt-trigger actions ■ Combines demultiplexer and 8 -bit latch ■ Serial-to-parallel capability ■ Output from each storage bit available ■ Random (addressable) data entry ■ Easily expandable ■ Common reset input ■ Useful as a 3 -to- 8 active HIGH decoder ■ Inputs accept voltages higher than VCCNXP Semiconductor...|$|E
