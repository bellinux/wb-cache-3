50|$|Schwabe {{created an}} {{important}} watercolor {{that was the}} modele of a <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> for the 1892 Salon de la Rose + Croix, the first of six exhibitions organized by Joséphin Péladan that demonstrated the Rosicrucian tendencies of French Symbolism. Schwabe's poster depicted in shades of blue an initiation rite—three women ascending toward spiritual salvation—and is an exemplar of Rosicrucian art.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Brigg affair, Mattie was advertised with the Walter L. Main Circus in 1894 and billed as [...] "Gaza the strong woman." [...] She was a {{featured}} act on a <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> printed to promote her. [...] Part of the advertisement reads: [...] "The Magnetic Wonder a Human Magnet of Strength and Weight {{the phenomenon of}} the 19th century, lifting hundreds of pounds of dead weight by just placing her hands on it, twisting bars of iron, resisting as much force as can push on a 12 foot pole by simply placing her hands at one end. It cannot be justly pictured, no words adequate to describe it." ...|$|E
50|$|In September and October 1906, {{the first}} group {{exhibition}} was held, focused on the female nude, in the showroom of K.F.M. Seifert and Co. in Dresden. Deriving from the life studies, Bleyl created a <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> for the show printed in orange ink on white paper. It has a narrow, portrait format, more akin to Japanese woodcuts than conventional contemporary prints, and was a distinct contrast to the poster designed by Otto Gussmann for the Third German Exhibition of Applied Arts, which had opened four months previously in Dresden. Bleyl omits iconography such as a crown, a lamp and a flowing gown, to show a bold nude of the model Isabella full-length above the lettering. Police censors barred the display of the poster under Paragraph 184, the National Penal Code pornography clause, after perceiving pubic hair in the shadow underneath the stomach.|$|E
5000|$|City streets where {{ordinary}} people {{spent most of}} their leisure time were main arenas for activity. Proponents urged that the streets be enlivened with bright colours [...] - [...] <b>lithographic</b> <b>posters</b> (e.g. those of Jules Chéret and Théophile Steinlen), and by artistically designed signs, lights and drinking fountains. The art was to be deliberately appealing, accessible and intelligible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds. Building façades and store fronts were singled out as especially good areas of transforming sombre streets into free outdoor museums.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925 Handschin was {{inspired}} by the transmission wheel poster of Niklaus Stoecklin (1896-1982), who had a passion for airbrushing objects, free of ornamentation, to express the perfection of the 'Machine Age' and using the technique as a substitute for photography in advertising consumer goods. This marked the start of the SachPlakat Basel school centered on the printer [...] "Wassermann". During the 1930s to 1950s, hyperrealist poster artists such as Hans Handschin, Herbert Leupin, Peter Birkhäuser, Fritz Bühler, Max Dalang and Donald Brun produced a great number of <b>lithographic</b> <b>posters</b> depicting products created by Basel manufacturers, and whose works were characterised by a rich palette of colours and flawless printing.|$|R
5000|$|Financially independent, {{he painted}} {{pictures}} for pleasure and made additional money by creating advertising posters {{in business and}} film. He won the prestigious position of graphic designer at the Bata company for a monthly fee of CZK 5,000. He {{is the author of}} many proposals of <b>lithographic</b> <b>posters.</b> He also worked for the Prague company Fr. Schnöbling, which produced Sypsi baby powder, dental hygiene BIS Acidentol and especially famous toothpaste Thymolin. The name is derived from thyme, having anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Toothpaste used and promoted the First Republic Czechoslovak Army. He {{is the author of the}} poster, which is famous for saying [...] "Thymolin Smile." [...] The graphic did not sign his work, but occasionally he included his initilas. He was a member of Creative Artists in Prague. After the Communist regime his works were exhibited only one joint exhibition. The first solo exhibition of Miloš Slovák business poster lithograph works organized Gallery in Prague Lucerna in April and May 2016, with all posters provided by Agentura ProVás.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1880 and 1935 Nahl was a {{prolific}} exhibitor throughout California and his oil paintings, drawings, charcoals, prints (especially monotypes, etchings, and lithographs), sculptures, and watercolors were consistently well received. Among his many awards was the bronze medal at Seattle’s Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1909 for his painting The Silence. [...] In 1915 at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), Nahl’s 13th Labor of Hercules <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> {{was given a}} first prize and selected as the official image, which was featured on maps, book covers and catalogues of the Exposition, advertised worldwide. The image features a muscular, male, nude straddled between two bodies of land symbolizing the Culebra Cut in the Panama Canal. [...] Also at the Exposition he received a bronze medal for his “psychological study” in oil entitled Despair and a silver medal for his thirteen etchings. [...] In 1926 he received a prize from the California Society of Etchers.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, Mourlot won a {{contract}} to produce an original <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> to promote an exhibition of French Modern Art in Copenhagen, Denmark. A few years later, through the friendship he had developed with the writer Georges Duhamel, himself a former veteran of World War I, Fernand Mourlot met the painter Maurice de Vlaminck. In 1926 the three men worked closely on the production of what became {{the first of many}} illustrated books printed by Mourlot Studios. 1930 marked the start of another important and long lasting cooperation: the one between Mourlot {{and the director of the}} French National Museums. That year, the Studios printed a poster for the hundred year anniversary of Romanticism and another poster to promote the retrospective of Delacroix's work at the Musée du Louvre. These were followed in 1932 by a poster for an exhibition of Édouard Manet's work at the Musée de l'Orangerie, and in 1934, a poster of Honoré Daumier's work at the Bibliothèque Nationale.|$|E
50|$|The {{news of the}} Mariposa Battalion's {{incursion}} into {{a valley}} (that the battalion members named Yosemite) {{for the purpose of}} tracking down alleged renegade Indians was fairly widely published, but the news focused on the confrontation. Hutchings {{was one of the few}} people to note the mention of a 1000 foot waterfall, and in 1854 when he was first formulating the idea of his illustrated magazine, he decided that a trip into that valley might make for interesting stories in the inaugural issue of the magazine. In the late spring of 1855 he hired artists to join him, and when the party arrived in the foothills he hired two Mi-Wuk men as guides. As the party came around Inspiration Point, they stopped long enough for Thomas Ayres to get a detailed sketch, which was published as a <b>lithographic</b> <b>poster</b> that fall, the first published image of Yosemite Valley. In June 1856, the entire account was published in Volume I of the magazine, and included five of Ayres' drawings.|$|E
5000|$|In his memoirs, Leavitt {{claimed to}} have made several {{innovations}} in American show business. For example, he credited himself {{with the introduction of}} <b>lithographic</b> theater <b>posters</b> to the United States in 1872 after he had brought some back from Europe. By the end of the 1870s, lithographic printing had begun to supplant block printing for theater advertising. Leavitt claimed that in the late 1870s, his six to eight touring burlesque companies required $8,000 to $20,000 worth of lithographs posters each season. Another of Leavitt's claims was that {{he was the first to}} use [...] "all star" [...] as a billing description. He also claimed that in 1880, he was the first to use the term vaudeville to describe a variety show.|$|R
5000|$|Beat the Whites {{with the}} Red Wedge ("Клином красным бей белых!") is a 1919 <b>lithographic</b> Soviet {{propaganda}} <b>poster</b> by artist Lazar Markovich Lissitzky, {{better known as}} El Lissitzky, [...] "the man through whose exertions the new Russian ideas became generally understood in Western Europe". In the poster, the intrusive red wedge symbolizes the Bolsheviks, who are penetrating and defeating their opponents, the White movement, during the Russian Civil War. It {{is an example of}} Constructivism.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to study the}} release and the project of Litografiskt Allehanda, an art {{magazine}} covering contemporary Swedish art and artists, published from 1859 to 1865. My purpose {{is to look at}} the choice of the published material for Litografiskt Allehanda, the influence the contributing artists, how the work with advertisement and subscriptions was made and if it fulfilled its own purpose. Through a social and communicative perspective I am studying the relations between the different actors like the publicists, the artists, the subscribers and also the interaction between the lithographs and the texts.   Litografiskt Allehanda was the first successful lithographic work produced in Sweden, and the release lasted for six years. The printer and lithographer Axel Jacob Salmson, who was the founder of the magazine, led the printing work for two years before Sigfrid Flodin, a bookseller, took over and continued the work for another four years. The idea with Litografiskt Allehanda was to reach out to people all over Sweden and give everyone an opportunity to enjoy art, something that usually was exclusively for the upper class in the big cities. The analysis shows that there were people in smaller cities that subscribed to the magazine and also that the amount increased every year. Every volume contained 48 <b>lithographic</b> <b>posters</b> with a diversity of genres, from portraits and landscapes to some with more ethnographic character and ancient Nordic motives. The content became more Swedish with every year and letters show that the participating artists had quite a big influence over the published material. Every poster was accompanied by a text, which didn’t necessary had anything to do with the image, but was meant to create some entertainment for the reader. Some of these essays were written by special authors, while some were written by the artists themselves. Even if Litografiskt Allehanda is mentioned in almost every reference as being of great importance for the development of lithography and its proliferation in Sweden, there is nothing written that is just about the magazine...|$|R

There is so much more to Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec than the avant-garde artisan-printmaker of most art historical literature. Significantly, Lautrec positioned himself as both a traditional fine artist and a modern, commercial designer, targeting audiences comprised of Montmartre locals, sophisticated patrons, and his fellow artistic circle. During {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, a battle between industry and tradition emerged. Prints and posters were examples of the fleeting nature of modernity, and, although they did not completely substitute for traditional works of art (i. e., paintings and sculpture), many began to supplement their collections with lithographs at a rate that caused anxiety among the traditionalists. With the support of influential publishers, dealers, and collectors, Lautrec propelled the color <b>lithographic</b> print and <b>poster</b> beyond the ephemeral in late nineteenth-century France and toward a more respected and collected work of art that became worthy of serious acclaim. This thesis looks deeply into the support network and critical discourse contemporary to Lautrec in order to recover his extraordinary success in manipulating the controversial and commercial medium of color lithography and in creating an iconic identity for himself as well as for the "French poster" as we know it today...|$|R
