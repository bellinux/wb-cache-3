5|$|The {{isotopes}} of ytterbium {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> technetium-98 (98Tc) is electron capture, producing molybdenum (Z=42).

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather.

5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive.

All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes <b>lighter</b> <b>than</b> 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E
