5|$|During {{the late}} Qing period and reform {{movements}} {{such as the}} Hundred Days' Reform, Chinese feminists called for women's <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> traditional roles and Neo-Confucian gender segregation. Later, the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce, and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women's liberation.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation {{of the human mind}} from the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Andrić {{had been}} Yugoslavia's {{ambassador}} to Germany from 1939 to 1941, {{during the early}} years of World War II, and was arrested by the Germans in April 1941, following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. In June 1941, he was allowed to return to German-occupied Belgrade but was confined to a friend's apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote over the next several years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade's <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the Nazis. The Bridge on the Drina was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} {{though he did not}} accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E
40|$|It was {{established}} that an addition of appropriate amounts of lecithin {{gave rise to}} quantitative <b>liberation</b> of choline <b>from</b> Sphigomyelin by the HCl-methanol hydrolysis, although, as previously reported, the <b>liberation</b> of choline <b>from</b> Sphingomyelin alone was not over 25 % of theoretical value. The addition of choline instead of lecithin produced the same accelerating effect on the <b>liberation</b> of choline <b>from</b> sphingomyelin. The <b>liberation</b> of choline <b>from</b> phosphorylcholine also was increased by an addition of lecithin. The rate of <b>liberation</b> of choline <b>from</b> sphingomyelin by NaOH- ethanol hydrolysis was accelerated {{with the addition of}} lecithin, although the amounts of choline liberated remained unchanged. The addition of unsaturated fatty acids, instead of lecithin, also showed a certain accelerating effect...|$|R

5|$|Substance Dualism is {{a common}} feature of several {{orthodox}} Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes samsara, a cycle of death and rebirth. The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the atman. Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha, <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the cycle of reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th century saw {{the first}} {{attempts}} at securing <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bolívar. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, New Granada and present-day Ecuador and Peru. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under one central government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces; Bolívar lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in 1830, after 11years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after this first encounter, on 14 August 1502, Columbus arrived on the {{mainland}} of Honduras. He dropped anchor at a place he named as Punta Caxinas, afterwards generally known as the Cape of Honduras, near the modern town of Trujillo. He claimed possession of the territory for the king of Spain, and the coastal inhabitants greeted him in a friendly manner. After this he sailed eastward along the coast, struggling against gales and storms for a month, until the coast turned southward along {{what is now the}} east coast of Honduras, and he entered calmer waters. The Spanish named this point Cabo Gracias a Dios, giving thanks for their <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the storms. Colombus sailed on southwards as far as Panama, before turning back into the Caribbean Sea to be wrecked off Jamaica, before being rescued and taken to Hispaniola, and from there returning to Spain.|$|E
5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to tone down dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, the Executive Committee of the Communist Internationalheadquartered in Moscowtelegraphed the Central Committee of the KPJ to take all measures to support and alleviate the struggle of the Soviet people, and to organise partisan detachments to fight the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Executive Committee also stressed that the fight, at the current stage, should not be about socialist revolution, but about the <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> the Axis occupiers. In response to this appeal, the leaders of the KPJ decided on 4July in Belgrade to launch a nationwide armed uprising, which began three days later in western Serbia. The members of the KPJ-led forces were called Partisans, and their supreme commander was Tito. On 13July, in Sarajevo, the KPJ Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina, headed by Svetozar Vukmanović, organised the province into military regions: Bosanska Krajina, Herzegovina, Tuzla, and Sarajevo.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is one of}} {{the four}} most devotionally revered Tirthankaras, along with Mahavira, Parshvanatha and Neminatha. Various Jain temple {{complexes}} across India feature him, and these are important pilgrimage sites in Jainism. Mount Shatrunjaya, for example, is a hilly part of southern Gujarat, which {{is believed to have been}} a place where 23 out of 24 Tirthankaras preached, along with Rishabha. Numerous monks are believed to have attained their <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> cycles of rebirth there, and a large temple within the complex is dedicated to Rishabha commemorating his enlightenment in Ayodhya. The central Rishabha icon of this complex is called Adinatha or simply Dada (grandfather). This icon is the most revered of all the murtipujaka icons, believed by some in the Jain tradition to have miracle making powers, according to John Cort. In Jain texts, Kunti and the five Pandava brothers of the Hindu Epic Mahabharata came to the hill top to pay respects, and consecrated an icon of Rishabha at Shatrunjaya.|$|E
5|$|The first Canadian Army units {{arrived in}} Britain in December 1939. In all, {{over a million}} Canadians served {{in the armed forces}} during World War II and {{approximately}} 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> Nazi Germany. The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{air raids}} on Singapore raised {{the morale of}} the island's {{civilian}} population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's <b>liberation</b> <b>from</b> Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were widely believed to be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11January and 24February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad's birthday. Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that {{only a limited number of}} civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful.|$|E
