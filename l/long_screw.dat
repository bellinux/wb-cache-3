6000|$|The wind was, of course, right abeam; the sea soon ran very high. [...] The Neva, being a <b>long</b> <b>screw,</b> was lively enough, and too lively; for {{she soon}} showed a chronic {{inclination}} to roll, and that suddenly, by fits and starts. The fiddles {{were on the}} tables for nearly a week: [...] {{but they did not}} prevent more than one of us finding his dinner suddenly in his lap instead of his stomach. However, no one was hurt, nor even frightened: save two poor ladies--not from Trinidad- -who spent their doleful days and nights in screaming, telling their beads, drinking weak brandy-and-water, and informing the hunted stewardess that if they had known what horrors they were about to endure, they would have gone to Europe in--a sailing vessel. The foreigners--who are usually, I know not why, bad sailors--soon vanished to their berths: so did the ladies: even those who were not ill jammed themselves into their berths, and lay there, for fear of falls and bruises; while the Englishmen and a coloured man or two--the coloured men usually stand the sea well--had the deck all to themselves; and slopped about, holding on, and longing for a monkey's tail; but on the whole rather liking it.|$|E
30|$|New timber {{technologies}} such as CLT have developed relatively effective and fire-safe connections. These often utilize <b>long</b> <b>screws</b> embedded in the solid panels. This offers good fire performance, as the screw head is a relatively small exposed area for heating in fire and the large screw length is protected within the solid timber.|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} safe {{rooms have}} {{walls and a}} door reinforced with sheets of steel, Kevlar, or bullet-resistant fiberglass. The hinges and strike plate are often reinforced with <b>long</b> <b>screws.</b> Some safe rooms may also have externally vented ventilation systems and a separate telephone connection. They might also connect to an escape shaft.|$|R

2500|$|External fixation, {{which can}} be used with either open or closed {{reduction}} uses a pin system, where <b>long</b> <b>screws</b> are passed through the skin and into either side of a fracture segment (typically 2 pins per side) then secured in place using an external fixator. [...] This is a more common approach when the bone is heavily comminuted (shattered into small pieces, for instance in a bullet wound) and when the bone is infected (osteomyelitis).|$|R
25|$|The screwed {{butt joint}} uses {{one or more}} screws {{inserted}} after the joint has been brought together. The screws are usually inserted into an edge on the long grain side of one member and extend through the joint into the end grain of the adjacent member. For this reason, <b>long</b> <b>screws</b> are required (usually 3 times {{the thickness of the}} member) to ensure good traction. These joints may also be glued although it is not necessary.|$|R
30|$|Recent digital {{volumetric}} imaging studies analysed palatal thickness and {{revealed that the}} thickest part of the palate is in the anterior region {{and that in the}} posterior region, mini-screws of appropriate lengths can also be placed [24],[26 – 28], which makes all proposed screw positions reasonable. The thick palatal bone allows wide and <b>long</b> <b>screws</b> to be used, as planned by several participants. Since only palatal screws were used, a certain bias might be introduced by the layout of the webpage because it was initialised with the occlusal view of the upper arch showing the palate.|$|R
50|$|The stair walker types use a <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> thread {{to extend}} and retract a 'foot' from the {{position}} at which the load is held. The two moving plates allow the item to be stepped down an arbitrary number of steps at any one time. To date the largest weight limit to be lifted by this method is 680 kg (cite). Some models using this approach also employ a third section to allow the load to be manipulated up and down independently of the base and wheel sections.|$|E
5000|$|This {{was a major}} {{improvement}} on previous non-stepped designs such as the de Bange system, which had only a single thread step and hence {{only half of the}} block's circumference had a thread which engaged with the breech, necessitating a fairly <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> to achieve a secure lock. The much greater threaded area of the Welin block allowed it to be shorter, allowing faster opening as it could be swung down or to the side after being withdrawn a much shorter distance than previous designs. It was also simpler and more secure.|$|E
50|$|Most {{acoustic}} guitars on the second-hand {{market are}} the Adjustomatic brand, {{noted by the}} fact that the guitar comes apart in two pieces - the neck and the body, through the clever and simple use of a <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> that holds the neck to the body. A threaded bolt turns against a small piece of 90-degree angle iron to allow the musician to easily adjust the string action, that is, the closeness of the strings to the fretboard on the neck. The guitar can be disassembled, reassembled and string action set with the use of a simple screwdriver.|$|E
30|$|Skin and {{subcutaneous}} fat were removed; the iliotibial band (ITB), deep fascia and retinacula were preserved. The fibular head was {{fixed to the}} tibia with two bone screws. Intramedullary rods were cemented into the femur and tibia. The patella was measured and the proximal-distal centre of the median patellar ridge determined: this was termed the ‘functional centre point’ (CP) (Merican et al. 2009). In preparation for patellar stability testing, a 10  mm diameter cavity was drilled 10  mm deep from the anterior surface of the patella (the patellar cartilaginous layer was not broken) at the CP and a polyethylene socket secured into the hole with four 13  mm <b>long</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

The kegs and tobacco were speedily carried down into a large cellar, the trapdoor was closed, and the boards placed securely in position and fastened by six <b>long</b> <b>screws.</b> Then they returned to the house. The teapot and cups were on the table, the kettle was boiling, and in two or three minutes they were taking tea. Scarcely had they begun their meal when there was a knock at the door.

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} IceMole is a pencil-shaped {{craft that}} is designed to autonomously deploy and dig itself into ice. It is a square tube of 225 cm2 cross section. It has a [...] melting head at the tip which has differential heating in different parts. The robot is powered by a power generator on the surface and is attached by means of a cable, which relays the power supply, communication and data signals. The IceMole utilizes a 6 cm <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> at its heated head that keeps firm contact while drilling with the ice being melted. The IceMole has separately controllable heating elements that can be manipulated to obtain differential heating. The differential heating permits the gradual change of direction.|$|E
5000|$|The 4.2-inch (30-pounder) rifles {{were the}} most widely used of the Parrott siege guns. The tubes were mounted on a {{conventional}} siege carriage. The early pattern guns had the elevating screw under the breech, while the newer pattern gun had a <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> running through the cascabel. The long elevating screws of the newer models were prone to breakage [...] The 4.2-inch Parrott rifles were preferred over the 4.5-inch siege rifles because of the superiority of Parrott shells over the various shells available for the 4.5-inch siege rifle. The 4.2-inch Parrott rifles did not have as great a propensity for bursting as found in the larger Parrott rifles. During the siege of Petersburg 44 4.2-inch Parrott rifles fired 12,209 rounds , but only one gun burst when a shell detonated before clearing the muzzle [...] One 4.2-inch Parrott rifle also burst during the campaign against Charleston harbor, but only after it had fired 4,606 rounds [...]|$|E
5000|$|Substitution as {{makeshift}} is when human ingenuity {{comes into}} play and a tool is used for its unintended purpose such as a mechanic using a <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> driver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. As {{an example of the}} former, many wood-cutting hand saws integrate a carpenter's square by incorporating a specially shaped handle that allows 90° and 45° angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying [...] "All tools can be used as hammers." [...] Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though very few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.|$|E

5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} cam-operated {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called screw machines or automatic screw machines. These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm <b>long.</b> <b>Screw</b> machines almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|E
50|$|A {{piling rig}} is a {{construction}} machine for piling in foundation engineering. It is mainly applied to drill in sandy soil, clay, silty clay, etc. and widely used cast-in-place piles, diaphragm walls, foundation reinforcement and other foundation projects. Its rated power of engine is around 108-450 kW, output torque 60-400 kN•m, maximum pile diameter 1.5-4 m, maximum pile depth 60-90 m. It can meet construction requirement of kinds of foundation engineering projects. It generally applies hydraulic crawler chassis, automatic lift box-type mast, telescopic drill pipe, auto vertical adjustor, depth indicator, etc. Its operation applies hydraulic pilot control, load sensor, {{thus it is}} easy and comfortable to control. Main and auxiliary hoisting can meet different requirements in construction sites.

The results show that number of connecting screw is key of parameter ratio and can be adjusted, and the large carrying capacity and accurate positioning meet the special requirement of big trip overloading linear drive applications...|$|E
30|$|Although {{there have}} been a number of studies {{comparing}} standard iliosacral screws with longer screw constructs, we know of no study directly comparing these longer screw methods. Tornetta et al. described the concept of different modes of failure [30], reporting that standard screws cut through the sacrum while long screws bent, indicating that the <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> was better anchored at its distal end [30]. However, in our study, after applying load to failure, none of the screws in either group were bent or broken. Our mode of failure was at the S 1 body and alar bone stock. This difference may be related to dissimilarities in design between the two studies: ours using a fracture-gap single-stance model; theirs using anatomic reduction in a bilateral-stance model.|$|E

Traditionally, nonsurgical management has been favored; however, recent evidence has emerged indicating that operative fixation produces lower nonunion rates, better functional outcomes, improved cosmesis, and greater patient satisfaction. Although clavicle fixation {{has been considered}} a safe procedure, several complications related to plate fixation have been reported. We report {{a case of a}} 21 -year-old basketball player that had a vascular complication associated with internal fixation of a clavicle fracture. An external compression of the subclavian vein was attributed to a <b>long</b> <b>screw</b> of a precontoured clavicular plate.
