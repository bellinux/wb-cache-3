500|$|<b>Loam</b> <b>construction,</b> {{the subject}} of this article, {{referred}} to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks, is an ancient building technology. It was used in the early civilizations of the Mediterranean, Egypt and Mesopotamia, in the Indus, Ganges and Yellow river valleys, in Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in <b>loam</b> <b>construction</b> has revived {{in the developed}} world. It {{is seen as a}} way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.The two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth, clay or loam, called pise de terre in French, and adobe, typically using sun-dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{excavated}} numerous ancient cities, {{among them}} Mohenjo Daro, Harrappa and Kot Diji, {{which have a}} uniform, appropriate structure with broad roads as well as well thought out sanitary and drainage facilities. The majority of the discovered brick constructions are public buildings such as bath houses and workshops. Wood and <b>loam</b> served as <b>construction</b> materials. Large scale temples, such as those found in other ancient cities are missing. With {{the collapse of the}} Indus Valley civilization the architecture also suffered considerable damage.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{development}} of new geosynthetics such as composite fabrics {{has been able to}} construct steep earthfill utilized high water content volcanic cohesive soils such as Kanto <b>loam</b> and/or even <b>construction</b> by-products which have never been used as fill materials. Recent developed composite fabric has almost the same tensile strength of geogrid and of course drainage effect. However, current design method of the steep reinforced earthfill with nonwoven fabric has not considered its reinforced effect and strength increase of cohesive soil by consolidation. Therefore, this paper deals with a proposal of new design method of a steep reinforced earthfill taking strength increase of volcanic cohesive soil with high water content by consolidation, characteristics of soil-fabric interaction and reinforced effect of composite fabric into account...|$|R
40|$|<b>Loam</b> <b>construction</b> has an old {{tradition}} – in many ancient cultures impressive {{examples of}} loam architecture were built; {{some of them}} still exist today. It {{is only in the}} recent past – approx. since World War II – that <b>loam</b> <b>construction</b> has been driven out of the industrial building sector. Today it is only very seldom used in Europe as a niche product in the handicraft sector. The old building material loam, its ecological and healthy properties, especially the improved living quality, is re-discovered by many architects and house builders, the demand is increasing steadily. Unfortunately there are no industrial building systems for <b>loam</b> <b>construction</b> available on the market at the moment. The market is restricted to some small providers of loam products, primarily loam plaster. WIENERBERGER AG, the world market leader in bricks, has now reacted to this development and has initiated a research project together with Lower Austria’s Green Building Cluster and other partners from industry, science and building practice, which has the target to develop an industrial building system on the basis of unfired clay blocks to reach a highest possible level of sustainability...|$|E
