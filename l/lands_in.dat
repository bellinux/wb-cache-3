5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl {{settled a}} number of his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> Sussex and Shropshire. Pantulf was probably not present at the Battle of Hastings, likely due to Earl Roger's lack of participation in the campaign of conquest. Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem. Although he had substantial <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> England, Pantulf continued to spend most of his time on the continent.|$|E

Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, {{with the death of}} Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) as king.|$|E
