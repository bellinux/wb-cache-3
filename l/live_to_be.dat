The average lifespan is about 60years, but they can <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well over 100years old. One such male even reproduced successfully {{for the first time}} at 111 years of age with an 80 year old female. Some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 25 to 30 years old.|$|E

25|$|Eastern gray females can rarely enter estrus {{as early}} as {{five and a half}} months old, but females are not {{normally}} fertile before at least one year of age. Their mean age of first estrus is 1.25 years. Male eastern grays are sexually mature between one and two years of age. These squirrels can <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 20 years old in captivity, but in the wild live much shorter lives due to predation and the challenges of their habitat. At birth, their life expectancy is 1–2 years, an adult typically can <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> six, with exceptional individuals making it to 12 years.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{trees in}} the {{preserve}} include valley oak and blue oak. The valley oak was once common in central California, forming large groves along rivers and streams. In grasslands, they form open savannas along with blue oaks. The valley oak is {{the largest of the}} native California oak trees and can <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 600 years old. With a vertical root system as deep as 80 feet, it can reach groundwater levels. The blue oak tolerates dry soil and can have a root system 30 feet deep. It has a distinctive blue tint in the green leaf color that can best be seen when compared to another nearby oak of a different type. The blue oak can <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 400 years old and provides critical winter range for deer and other wildlife.|$|E

Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to <b>live</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.|$|E

The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth.

John's first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building.
