50|$|When the {{probate court}} determines that the {{doctrine}} applies to a <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> {{made to a}} will beneficiary, the amount beneficiary's gift under the will is reduced by the amount the beneficiary has already received. For example, if the will bequeaths $5,000 to a beneficiary, but the beneficiary received a <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> of $4,000 from testator that was intended to partially satisfy the gift under the will, the beneficiary will receive only $1,000 under the will. If the will provides that the beneficiary receives {{a percentage of the}} testator's estate, the court may engage in a hotchpot calculation to determine the amount, if any, that the beneficiary should receive under the will. If the value of the <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> received is greater than the beneficiary's calculated share under the will, the beneficiary receives nothing under the will, but does not return any of the lifetime gifts.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{state law}} determines which {{lifetime}} gifts {{are treated as}} gifts in satisfaction of a bequest. Under the Uniform Probate Code, § 2-609, a <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> is treated as satisfaction of a legacy only if (i) the will provides for deduction of the gift, (ii) the testator indicated in a contemporaneous writing that the <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will, or (iii) the gift recipient acknowledged in writing that the gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will. Courts may presume that gifts of money from a parent to a child after {{the execution of the}} parent's will are gifts in satisfaction of the child's legacy under the will, even without a written indication of intent to satisfy the provision under the will. Courts are reluctant to apply the doctrine to certain kinds of legacies, for example, devises of specific real estate or bequests of personal property. These specific legacies are viewed by courts as unique and not able to be replaced with a <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> of money or other property.|$|E
50|$|Ademption by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction of legacies, is a common law doctrine that determines the disposition of property under a will when the testator has made lifetime gifts to beneficiaries named in the will. Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a named beneficiary of the will is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> to satisfy a bequest under the will, {{the amount of the}} <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gift tax}} is a {{backstop}} to the United States estate tax. Without the gift tax, large estates {{could be reduced}} by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential estate tax. Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> tax exclusion. Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 {{at a much lower}} rate than the estate tax, a full 25% under the estate tax rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under estate tax. The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the estate tax rate.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to stories}} in The Boy Biggles and Biggles Goes to School, James Bigglesworth {{was born in}} India in May 1899, {{the son of an}} {{administrator}} in the Indian Civil Service and his wife (née Lacey). James was the younger of two sons, Charles being the elder by five years. The young James had little contact with European culture and commenced a lifelong affection for India, befriending the local Indian boys, exploring the countryside and learning to speak fluent Hindi. He retained a <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> for languages and as an adult spoke French and German fluently, with a [...] "fair command" [...] of various other languages. He spent holidays in England, under the custody of [...] "Dickpa", an eccentric uncle and inventor who lived in rural Norfolk. When Biggles, now an adult, visits Dickpa, his father's brother, again, an adventure begins that takes both men to Brazil. Biggles then attended Malton Hall School in Hertbury, England. His first encounter with an aircraft was with a Blériot that landed on the school cricket ground.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inheritance}} tax, {{which is}} also known as the [...] "gift tax", has been altered in the Post-World War II era as well. First established in 1932 as a means to raise tax revenue from the wealthiest Americans, the inheritance tax was put at a nominal rate of 25% points lower than the estate tax which meant its effective rate was 18.7%. Its exemption, up to $50,000, was the same as the estate tax exemption. Under current law, individuals can give gifts of up to $13,000 without incurring a tax and couples can poll their gift together to give a gift of up to $26,000 a year without incurring a tax. The <b>lifetime</b> <b>gift</b> tax exemption is $5 million which is the same amount as the estate tax exemption. These two exemptions are directly tied to each other as the amount exempted from one reduces the amount that can be exempted from the other at a 1:1 ratio. The inheritance/gift tax generally affects {{a very small percentage of}} the population as most citizens do not inherit anything from their deceased relatives in any given year. In 2000, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland published a report that found that 1.6% of Americans received an inheritance of $100,000 or more and an additional 1.1% received an inheritance worth $50,000 to $100,000 while 91.9% of Americans did not receive an inheritance. A 2010 report conducted by Citizens for Tax Justice found that only 0.6% of the population would pass on an inheritance in the event of death in that fiscal year. Accordingly, data shows that inheritance taxes are a tax almost exclusively on the wealthy. In 1986, Congress enacted legislation to prevent trust funds of wealthy individuals from skipping a generation before taxes had to be paid on the inheritance.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the time}} and {{expenses}} associated with the traditional probate process, modern estate planners frequently counsel clients to enact probate avoidance strategies.

If a revocable living trust {{is used as a}} part of an estate plan, the key to probate avoidance is ensuring that the living trust is [...] "funded" [...] during the lifetime of the person establishing the trust. After executing a trust agreement, the settlor should ensure that all assets are properly re-registered {{in the name of the}} living trust.

Thus, at one extreme, if the subject matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor’s other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other extreme, if its effect is to dispose of the donor’s only asset of value and thus, for practical purposes, to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor understands the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{upcoming}} one-year {{repeal of}} the federal estate tax in the U. S. creates an opportunity to reconsider the taxation of wealth transfers. This article argues that if inheritances are included in an optimal tax framework, existing {{evidence suggests that the}} ideal wealth transfer tax would be much higher than current law, and {{take the form of a}} comprehensive inheritance tax, which includes amounts inherited above an exemption in the tax base and subjects them to higher rates. Doing so accounts for the net efficiency benefits of taxing inheritances, and the direct and indirect information they provide about the heir 2 ̆ 7 s economic status. The article then proposes seizing the political moment to replace the federal estate tax with a comprehensive inheritance tax that takes into account administrative and political constraints. This new tax would exempt from taxation roughly 2 million in <b>lifetime</b> <b>gifts</b> and bequests received. Inheritances received beyond this amount would be taxed at the heir 2 ̆ 7 s income tax rate plus 15 percentage points. The proposal would improve incentives and reduce complexity relative to the estate tax. More importantly, it would enhance the equity and transparency of the tax system. The paper 2 ̆ 7 s estimates suggest that the estate tax does a good job in aggregate of correcting for the undertaxation of heirs relative to those whose wealth is self-made, but that it does a poor job at an individual level. The proposal would allocate tax burdens more fairly amongst heirs. Ultimately, because its form more transparently embodies its effects, it could also reinvigorate public support for taxing inheritances at more socially-optimal levels in the first place...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the relative importance of theoretically constructed variables upon the giving behaviors of the $ 1 million contributors to a Southwestern Research I University and upon donor/recipient relationships. The results were intended to expand the overall knowledge about donors and to improve the fund-raising strategies of higher education institutions. In the utility maximization framework of this study, four giving submodels (motivations) and three bilateral submodels (two-way transactions) were constructed. Two research questions were developed in accordance with the theoretical framework. The study utilized an interview process to gain information from those donors contributing a minimum of $ 1 million (<b>lifetime</b> <b>gifts,</b> pledges, and commitments) to a Research I University in the Southwestern United States. Thirty interviews (seventeen individuals, eight corporations, and five family foundations) were conducted by telephone or in person over a five-month period. Unstructured questions were utilized to initiate and to summarize the seven sections of the guide. The sections were arranged to follow what was thought to be the typical gift process. Structured questions were used secondarily to elicit elaborations of the initial interview responses and to explore topics not discussed by the interviewee. A fourteen-item questionnaire based upon the seven theoretical submodels was administered after each interview. Donors were asked to indicate on a Likert scale the relative importance of each question in their decision to give a substantial gift to the University. In the qualitative assessment, the responses were coded and analyzed utilizing the seven submodels developed in the framework. In the quantitative assessment, the questionnaire scores were utilized to calculate the means and standard deviations for each submodel. The findings were organized in accordance with the seven submodels. Among the four giving submodels, altruism was clearly the primary motivation for giving, followed by profit maximization, reciprocity, and direct benefit. Among the three bilateral submodels, donor involvement and foreground activities were clearly most important to donors, followed by background activities. This research should lead to a more complete explanation of donor/recipient behavior...|$|R

But there are planning techniques that can help. Individuals in the ‘modest‘ wealth category face special hurdles in estate planning. This article will assume that the ‘modest‘ wealth category includes individuals whose net worth exceeds the amount of taxable gifts that may be protected by the unified credit (the equivalent of 1 million and herein {{referred to as the}} ‘gift tax exemption‘), but does not exceed approximately 5 million. In general, people of modest wealth may not easily be able to afford to give up significant levels of their net worth during lifetime to achieve estate planning goals. However, the lifetime transfer of wealth {{is one of the most}} useful ways to reduce estate taxes. Unlike individuals whose wealth is small enough that it most likely will be protected from tax by reason of credits or exemptions (for 2007, for example, the federal estate tax exemption equivalent is 2 million) or those whose wealth is so large that an achieved lifestyle almost certainly will continue regardless of how much is transferred during lifetime, individuals of modest wealth face a real tension between opportunities to reduce taxes and protect assets from other claims which may arise, on the one hand, and the need to preserve an adequate base of wealth to ensure the maintenance of a current standard of living on the other. The advisor to these individuals should carefully consider which planning steps are most appropriate and what level of transfers the individual reasonably can afford to make. Certainly, different problems and potential solutions will arise for each individual, and the plan must be tailored to each person 2 ̆ 7 s unique circumstances and goals. Nonetheless, such individuals need estate and financial planning as much as anyone else does, perhaps even more so.
