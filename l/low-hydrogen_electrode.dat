40|$|Continuing the {{previous}} report(N 0. 1) ，we want to report here {{the results of}} some experiments on the variation of the maximum arc length under various blowing directions {{and the influence of}} the wind to the vaporized coating of electrodes. 　　An outline of the results will be described below. 　　(1) The maximum arc length is affected remarkably by the coating of electrode. The　arc　length　of　an　ilumenite　electrode　is　longer　than　that　of　a　<b>low-hydrogen</b> <b>electrode.</b> It is observed that the vaporized coating， i. e. gas molecules， is　more　effective on striking　the arc　than　the　vaporized　core metal and moreover　the former depends strongly on t he winds 2 ̆ 7 conditions. 　　(2) The maximum arc length is affected by the blowing directions. 　In the opposite blowing {{it is going to be}} the shortest and in the backward blowing， inclined at 45 °，it is going to be the longest. 　　(3) The relation of L(θ) /L(π/ 2) and θ or the variation of the arc angle is independent of the kind of electrode and the blowing direction. 　　(4) The arc voltage at a moment of arc-vanishing depends on the blowing direction but the current is not so much affected. 　　(5) These results suggest that the interaction of the wind and the gas ionic flow of the coating will be a subject for a next study...|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when <b>low-hydrogen</b> <b>electrodes</b> are used.|$|R
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if <b>low-hydrogen</b> <b>electrodes</b> and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|R
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or <b>low-hydrogen</b> <b>electrodes,</b> are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|R
