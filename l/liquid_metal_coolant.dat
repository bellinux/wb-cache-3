In 1972, the submarine suffered a major reactor problem {{in the form of}} a leak of <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolant.</b> The superheated metal solidified on contact with the colder outside air, freezing and damaging internal components of the reactor. She was removed from service and towed to Severodvinsk. At the dockyard, the damage to the reactor was deemed too extensive for repair and the decision was made to salvage as much as they could. K-64 was split in half, its bow section (including control spaces) was taken to Leningrad and used for training new Soviet submariners.|$|E

The {{following}} year, however, [...] "the K-64 suffered a major reactor problem when the liquid metal in the primary coolant hardened". Her hull was cut in half in 1973-1974 at Sverodvinsk, the forward portion being sent to Leningrad {{to be used for}} training, the reactor compartment being kept at Zvezdochka. The remaining boats were decommissioned for scrapping, five in 1990 and one in 1996. As of February 2003, K-463, K-316, K-432 and K-493 had been dismantled at Sevmash, with the remaining two at Bolshaya Lopatka, Zapadnaya Litsa, awaiting the same fate. [...] The Alfa reactors use a <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolant</b> that must be kept at a temperature over 123°C to avoid solidifying; a 2002 paper reports that the coolant in both K-123 and K-373 has solidified.

50|$|Since <b>liquid</b> <b>metals</b> {{have low}} moderating power and ratio {{and no other}} {{moderator}} is present, the primary interaction of neutrons with <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolants</b> is the (n,gamma) reaction, which induces radioactivity in the coolant. Boiling in the coolant, e.g. in an accident, would reduce coolant density and thus the absorption rate, such that the reactor has a positive void coefficient, which is dangerous and undesirable from a safety and accident standpoint. This can be avoided with a gas cooled reactor, since voids do not form in such a reactor during an accident; however, activation in the coolant remains a problem. A helium-cooled reactor would avoid this, since the elastic scattering and total cross sections are approximately equal, i.e. {{there are very few}} (n,gamma) reactions in the coolant and the low density of helium at typical operating conditions means that the amount neutrons have few interactions with coolant.|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} primary {{results of the}} Laboratory Directed Research and Development project (LDRD 08 - 0857) Metal Fires and Their Implications for Advance Reactors. Advanced {{reactors}} may employ <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolants,</b> typically sodium, because of their many desirable qualities. This project addressed some of the significant challenges {{associated with the use}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolants,</b> primary among these being the extremely rapid oxidation (combustion) that occurs at the high operating temperatures in reactors. The project has identified a number of areas for which gaps existed in knowledge pertinent to reactor safety analyses. Experimental and analysis capabilities were developed in these areas to varying degrees. In conjunction with team participation in a DOE gap analysis panel, focus was on the oxidation of spilled sodium on thermally massive surfaces. These are spills onto surfaces that substantially cool the sodium during the oxidation process, and they are relevant because standard risk mitigation procedures seek to move spill environments into this regime through rapid draining of spilled sodium. While the spilled sodium is not quenched, the burning mode is different in that there is a transition to a smoldering mode that has not been comprehensively described previously. Prior work has described spilled sodium as a pool fire, but there is a crucial, experimentally-observed transition to a smoldering mode of oxidation. A series of experimental measurements have comprehensively described the thermal evolution of this type of sodium fire for the first time. A new physics-based model has been developed that also predicts the thermal evolution of this type of sodium fire for the first time. The model introduces smoldering oxidation through porous oxide layers to go beyond traditional pool fire analyses that have been carried out previously in order to predict experimentally observed trends. Combined, these developments add significantly to the safety analysis capabilities of the advanced-reactor community for directly relevant scenarios. Beyond the focus on the thermally-interacting and smoldering sodium pool fires, experimental and analysis capabilities for sodium spray fires have also been developed in this project...|$|R
50|$|Fast breeder {{reactors}} {{are more}} susceptible to meltdown than other reactor types, due to the larger quantity of fissile material and the higher neutron flux inside the reactor core, which makes it more difficult to control the reaction.This is not true of the Integral Fast Reactor model EBR II, which was explicitly designed to be meltdown-immune. It was tested in April 1986, just before the Chernobyl failure, to simulate loss of coolant pumping power, by switching off the power to the primary pumps. As designed, it shut itself down, in about 300 seconds, as soon as the temperature rose to a point designed as higher than proper operation would require. This was well below the boiling point of the unpressurised <b>liquid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coolant,</b> which had entirely sufficient cooling ability to deal with the heat of fission product radioactivity, by simple convection.The second test, deliberate shut-off of the secondary coolant loop that supplies the generators, caused the primary circuit to undergo the same safe shutdown.This test simulated the case of a water-cooled reactor losing its steam turbine circuit, perhaps by a leak.|$|E
