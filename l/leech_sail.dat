5000|$|Edges - The {{top of all}} sails {{is called}} the head, the leading edge is called the luff on fore-and-aft sails and on {{windward}} <b>leech</b> symmetrical <b>sails,</b> the trailing edge is the leech, and the bottom edge is the foot. The head is attached at the throat and peak to a gaff, yard, or sprit. For a triangular sail the head refers to the topmost corner.|$|R
25|$|Kicking straps / boom vangs, which {{control a}} boom-footed <b>sail's</b> <b>leech</b> tension by exerting {{downward}} force mid-boom. Normally {{this is a}} system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch cordage but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the kicking strap (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.|$|R
50|$|Computer cut sails {{can produce}} {{the amount of}} twist {{specified}} by the sailmaker, and in different conditions, different amounts of twist may be desirable. Less twist is generally desirable in light air conditions and slackening the luff tension will tighten the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail.</b> This moves the center of effort on the sail toward the trailing edge and reduces twist thus making the sail more powerful but vulnerable to stalling.|$|R
50|$|The Spritsail {{is another}} rig with a four-sided fore-aft sail. Unlike the gaff rig where the head hangs from a spar along its edge, this rig {{supports}} the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail</b> {{by means of}} a spar named a sprit. The forward end of the sprit is attached to the mast but bisects the face of the sail, with the after end of the sprit attaching to the peak and/or the clew of the sail.|$|R
50|$|The crab claw {{may also}} {{traditionally}} be constructed with curved spars, giving {{the edges of}} the sail along the spars a convex shape, while the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail</b> is often quite concave to keep it stiff on the trailing edge. These features give it its distinct, claw-like shape. Modern crab claws generally have straighter spars and a less convex leech, which gives more sail area for a given length of spar. Spars may taper towards the leech. The structure helps the sail to spill gusts.|$|R
50|$|A Chinese gybe on a {{sailing vessel}} {{is a type}} of gybe where the upper section of the main sail moves across the boat, filling from the {{opposite}} side, whilst the lower section and boom remain on the original side of the vessel. It contrasts with a normal gybe, where the whole sail moves across the boat as the boat turns its stern through the wind. A Chinese gybe is usually induced by too little tension on the vang or kicking strap, allowing the boom to rise up and the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail</b> to twist excessively.|$|R
5000|$|Shaping - Barber haulers adjust a spinnaker/jib {{sheeting}} angle inboard {{at right}} angles to the sheet with a ring or clip on the sheet attached to cordage which is secured and adjusted via fairlead and cam cleat. Kicking straps/boom vangs control a boom-footed <b>sail's</b> <b>leech</b> tension by exerting downward force mid-boom. Cunninghams tighten the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. Downhauls lower a sail or a yard and can adjust the tension on the luff of a sail. [...] Outhauls control the foot tension of a boom-footed sail.|$|R
5000|$|The luff of {{the sail}} {{is bound to}} the mast, but unlike the gaff rig where the head is bound to a spar, this rig {{supports}} the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail</b> by means of a diagonal spar or spars named a sprit. [...] The forward end of the sprit spar is attached to the mast, with the after end of the sprit spar attached to the peak. The sprit is steadied and controlled from the deck by a pair of wire vangs attached to the peak of the sail. It {{is said to be the}} ancestor from which the common gaff rig evolved in 16th-century Holland. The foot of the sail may be bent to a boom, or be loose-footed and just controlled by its sheets.|$|R
50|$|Tasman {{noted that}} two of the waka which {{attacked}} his ships in Murderers Bay Nelson in December 1642, had a sail that Tasman referred to as a Tingang sail-a small triangular sail often temporarily hoisted. Later early Europeans from the 1830s onwards gave detailed descriptions of the use, appearance and materials used in Māori sails. Although there were regional variations within New Zealand most sails were temporary and could be hoisted or struck in a few minutes. The roughly triangular sail, usually made from either flax, ti leaves or raupō (bull rushes) or a combination,was set about 1/3 back from the bow. The raupō sail was much lighter. The mast and yard spars were small diameter,with the yard being thinner, about 5m high long and permanently attached to the sail so the rig was raised as a single unit. Loops were woven into both the luff and the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail</b> for attachment to the spars. Tanekaha (Celery Pine) branches were favoured as it was common, (as far south as Nelson). It was a straight, strong and flexible wood. An added advantage may have been that the wood bled red tannin, a colour strongly favoured by Māori.|$|R
50|$|Eagle has a three-masted barque sailing rig, {{with two}} masts fully rigged with 'square sails' and one mast with only 'fore-and-aft' sails. The large sail {{area of the}} 'square sails' provide much of the power while the 'fore-and-aft' sails enable {{superior}} maneuverability. The ship has over 6 mi of running rigging and approximately 22280 sq ft of sail area. To protect sails from chafing, Eagle uses baggywrinkle extensively. The top three yards of the fore- and main masts are moveable, and are kept lowered when not sailing to lower the ship's center of gravity. In addition, the top portion of the fore- and main masts, known as the topgallant masts, may be housed (lowered) by 13 ft when not under sail in order to sail underneath low bridges. Eagles fastest point of sail is when her yards are braced sharp (or pivoted {{as much as they}} can be) and the relative wind (the wind you feel standing on the ship as it moves) is approximately 5-10 degrees aft of the windward <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail.</b> When fully braced, Eagle can sail about 75 degrees off of the true wind. Eagles propeller shaft can also be de-clutched from the engine so the propeller can freewheel, thus lessening drag while under sail.|$|R
60|$|There {{were many}} {{extraordinary}} tales related that night, on board Her Britannic Majesty's ship Coquette. The boatswain affirmed that, while piping below {{in order to}} overhaul the cables, he had heard a screaming in the air, that sounded as if a hundred devils were mocking him, and which he told the gunner, in confidence, he believed {{was no more than}} the winding of a call on board the brigantine, who had taken occasion, when other vessels were glad to anchor, to get under way, in her own fashion. There was also a fore-top-man named Robert Yarn, a fellow whose faculty for story-telling equalled that of Scheherazade, and who not only asserted, but who confirmed the declaration by many strange oaths, that while he lay on the lee-fore-top-sail-yard-arm, stretching forth an arm to grasp the <b>leech</b> of the <b>sail,</b> a dark-looking female fluttered over his head and caused her long hair to whisk into his face, in a manner that compelled him to shut his eyes, which gave occasion to a smart reprimand from the reefer of the top. There was a feeble attempt to explain this assault, by the man who lay next to Yarn, who affected to think the hair was no more than the end of a gasket whipping in the wind; but his shipmate, who had pulled one of the oars of the yawl, soon silenced this explanation, by the virtue of his long-established reputation for veracity. Even Trysail ventured several mysterious conjectures concerning the fate of the brigantine, in the gun-room; but, on returning from the duty of sounding the inlet, whither he had been sent by his captain, he was less communicative and more thoughtful than usual. It appeared, indeed, from the surprise that was manifested by every officer that heard the report of the quarter-master, who had given the casts of the lead on this service, {{that no one in the}} ship, with the exception of Alderman Van Beverout, was at all aware that there was rather more than two fathoms of water in that secret passage.|$|R
