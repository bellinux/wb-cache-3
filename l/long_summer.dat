5|$|The Hungarian Scout {{program had}} four stages. During {{the first three}} years, Bánáthy {{advanced}} three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called Turul, after the mythical bird of Hungary. From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> camp. Bánáthy and his troop attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933. Up until this time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate {{and is one}} of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. The <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53° 43′ N and 51° 38′ N). Aberystwyth, at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over sevenandahalf hours.|$|E
5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> coming to an end.|$|E

25|$|While {{extreme weather}} is rare, {{the city and}} county can {{experience}} severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland.

Daylight at midsummer is before 04:20 and lasts until after 23:00. In midwinter, daylight does not start until 08.49, and is gone by 16:19.|$|E
25|$|Zubarah was {{primarily}} an emporium and pearling settlement that capitalized on {{its proximity to}} pearl beds, possession of a large harbour and its central position on the Gulf routes. Its economy depended on the pearl diving season, which {{took place during the}} <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> months. Pearling would draw Bedouin from the interior of Qatar as well as the {{people from all over the}} Persian Gulf to dive, trade and safeguard the town from attack while the town’s men were at sea.|$|E
25|$|Their third appearance, a Bach {{concert in}} April 1928, was also their last before a <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> break, during which a large {{advertising}} campaign {{was carried out}} to ensure {{the continued existence of}} the group. Adolf Hamm, an organist at the Münster, {{played an important role in}} the campaign; he ensured that after the successful campaign, the choir, which had grown to 63 boys, was able to perform the Christmas Oratorio for Christmas, 1928, and a Passion concert for Easter, 1929. In August, 1929, a working party was founded on the occasion of the first parents' evening, and Jakob Staehelin was elected its first president, making him also the first president of the KKB.|$|E

25|$|Her {{remains were}} found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To {{preserve}} her body during the <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered {{in a mixture of}} ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{proposed}} by Ewing and Donn in 1956 hypothesized that an ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean {{there is little}} evaporation or sublimation and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation, comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude deserts. This low precipitation allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> days, and evaporates more water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this snow may not melt {{during the summer and}} so glacial ice can form at lower altitudes and more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5–20 years, see Arctic shrinkage.) Additional fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also reduce the global ocean water circulation. Such a reduction (by reducing the effects of the Gulf Stream) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe, which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers may move through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, extending into the North Atlantic Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.|$|E

[...] These <b>long</b> <b>summer</b> breaks were repeated in 1852 and 1853 at Torquay and Tenby. [...] Even on holiday, his fame caused him to receive many requests for consultations.

[...] Meanwhile, he continued to see patients, but only in his house, despite seriously deteriorating health. [...] He died on 27 October 1854 at St Cuthbert from a urinary tract infection and suffering from kidney stones. [...] His early death at 39 may have been due to a combination of lifelong frail health and overwork, which Bird himself knew to be destroying him.Coley, p. 364, The Medical Examiner, vol. 11, p. 46, Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston 1850.
