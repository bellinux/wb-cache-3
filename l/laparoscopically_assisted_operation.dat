40|$|Background: Ileocolic {{resection}} for Crohn's {{disease can}} be performed entirely laparoscopically. However, an incision is needed for specimen extraction. This prospective observational study assessed the feasibility of endoscopic transcolonic specimen removal. Methods: Endoscopic specimen removal was attempted in a consecutive series of ten patients scheduled for laparoscopic ileocolic resection. Primary outcomes were feasibility, operating time, reoperation rate, pain scores, morphine requirement and hospital stay. To assess applicability, outcomes were compared with previous data from patients who had <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>operations.</b> Results: Transcolonic removal was successful in eight of ten patients; it was considered not feasible in two patients because the inflammatory mass was too large (7 - 8 cm). Median operating time was 208 min and median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days. After surgery two patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess, drained laparoscopically or percutaneously, and one patient had another site-specific infection. The operation took longer than conventional laparoscopy, with no benefits perceived by patients in terms of cosmesis or body image. Conclusion: Transcolonic removal of the specimen in ileocolic Crohn's disease is feasible {{in the absence of}} a large inflammatory mass but infection may be a problem. It is unclear whether the technique offers benefit compared with conventional laparoscopic surger...|$|R
40|$|Objective:  To {{examine the}} trends in {{hysterectomy}} in New South Wales (NSW) from 1981 to 1999 – 2000 {{and the impact}} of endometrial ablation. Data:  Computerised discharge summaries from private and public hospitals for the years 1981, 1991, 1994 – 1995 and 1999 – 2000 obtained from the NSW Health Department. All records listing hysterectomy in women over the age of 20 in each period were selected and those listing endometrial ablation since 1991 were also selected. Operative procedure, diagnosis, hospital type, length of stay and demographic data were recorded. Annual figures since 1988 – 1989 for hysterectomy and ablation were also obtained. Findings:  Initially it appeared that the introduction of endometrial ablation might reduce hysterectomy rates, but the combined rate of hysterectomy and endometrial ablation continued to rise to a peak in 1992 – 1993 and has declined since. The hysterectomy rate in 1999 – 2000 was lower than in 1981. There has been a marked shift from abdominal to vaginal hysterectomy, with an increase in <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>operations.</b> Overall, the mean age at operation has been rising, although the mean age for vaginal hysterectomy has fallen. The shift to private hospitals and reduction in hospital stay have continued. Conclusion:  The trends are consistent with the increased use of laparoscopic and ablation techniques, improvements in hormonal contraceptive use, and better access to abortion, which have facilitated women's decisions to postpone their births and to conserve their childbearing to older ages. Further development of these techniques {{will have an impact on}} gynaecological training and practice in the next decade. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate short-term results of <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy with those of total abdominal hysterectomy in a prospective, randomized, multicenter study. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred sixteen patients referred for abdominal hysterectomy were randomized to either <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy (58 patients) or abdominal hysterectomy (58 patients). Inclusion criteria were one or more of the following, where a vaginal hysterectomy would be traditionally contraindicated: uterine size larger than 280 g, previous pelvic surgery, history of pelvic inflammatory disease, moderate or severe endometriosis, concomitant adnexal masses or indication for adnexectomy, and nulliparity with lack of uterine descent and limited vaginal access. An upper limit of uterine size was set at 16 weeks' gestation tie, 700 g). RESULTS: There were no differences in terms of patient's age, parity, preoperative hemoglobin levels, mean uterine weight, and total operating time between the 2 groups. Estimated blood losses and postoperative day 1 hemoglobin drop were significantly lower for <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy than for abdominal hysterectomy (P <. 05). There were 1 major and 2 minor complications in the <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy group compared with 2 major and 5 minor complications in the abdominal hysterectomy group (P not significant). Postoperative pain was lower for <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy than for abdominal hysterectomy on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 (P <. 05). Postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy than for abdominal hysterectomy (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that, given adequate training in laparoscopic surgery, <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy may replace abdominal hysterectomy in most patients who require a hysterectomy and have contraindications to vaginal hysterectomy, with all the benefits associated with the vaginal route...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Higuchi's {{transverse}} incision is {{made at a}} {{lower position}} than the Pfannenstiel transverse incision and is superior in terms of cosmetic outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the safety and efficacy of novel forms of reduced port surgery for ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids applying Higuchi's transverse incision. Methods: In 33 patients with ovarian cysts who underwent low-position single-incision laparoscopic surgery (L-SILS) -modified single-port laparoscopy placed in the 2 – 3 -cm Higuchi's incision above the pubis, patient's characteristics and perioperative outcomes were compared with those of patients who underwent multiport laparoscopy (n= 53). In addition, 18 patients with uterine fibroids who underwent dual-port <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> myomectomy without using power morcellators and conventional four-port <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> myomectomy were investigated. Results: There were no significant differences between L-SILS and multiport laparoscopy in tumor diameter, bleeding, hospital stay, or postoperative pain. However, the L-SILS group demonstrated significantly shorter operative and pneumoperitoneum times (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 01). In comparison with cases of uterine fibroids, no significant differences were found in maximum fibroid diameter, operative time, pneumoperitoneum time, or bleeding. However, the dual-port <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> myomectomy group demonstrated a significantly shorter length of hospital stay than the conventional <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> myomectomy group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: We reported novel forms of reduced port surgery applying Higuchi's transverse incision. It was suggested that these procedures are relatively simple, but ensure the same safety and efficacy as conventional methods.

40|$|Recently, <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> bowel resections {{have been}} shown to be less morbid than the {{traditional}} laparotomy, especially for benign conditions such as Crohn's disease. While reports describing <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> bowel resections use a small midline or right transverse incision, we describe a novel <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> approach employing a Pfannenstiel incision for Crohn's patients. We attempted the Pfannenstiel incision since it is well known to be associated with less postoperative pain, decreased ileus and hospital stay, and low rates of wound infection and incisional hernia, compared with midline or right transverse incisions. Furthermore, we found that the Pfannenstiel incision offers additional advantages that may be uniquely suited for Crohn's patients. First, the cosmetic position of the incision is particularly attractive to the young population affected by Crohn's. Second, the Pfannenstiel incision preserves fresh tissue in the midline, right, and left lower quadrants in the event that reoperation or stoma placement are required in the future owing to recurrent disease. We describe our technique in 10 consecutive patients undergoing ileocolectomy for Crohn's disease. Our patients experienced minimal morbidity and were pleased with the cosmetic results of their incisions...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many hysterectomies are now {{performed}} by a <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal technique. This procedure is controversial, partly because of concern about cost. We studied hospital charges and costs for the procedure as compared with those for total abdominal hysterectomy and total vaginal hysterectomy in clinically similar groups of patients. METHODS: From hospital-discharge data and patients' charts, we identified hysterectomies performed in 1993 and 1994 by 96 surgeons at a community teaching hospital to treat benign conditions. The patients were grouped according to the surgical procedures performed {{in conjunction with the}} hysterectomy. Data on hospital charges and cost-to-charge ratios for 64 hospital cost centers were used to assess charges and costs for specific resources, {{as well as for the}} hospitalization overall. RESULTS: Of 1049 patients studied, 26 percent underwent <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy, 54 percent underwent abdominal hysterectomy, and 20 percent underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The average hospital stays were 2. 6, 3. 9, and 2. 9 days, respectively, and the mean total charges (facility charges plus professional fees) for the hospitalizations were $ 6, 116, $ 5, 084, and $ 4, 221 (P< 0. 001 for the comparison of the laparoscopic technique with both other techniques). The mean facility costs were $ 4, 914, $ 3, 954, and $ 3, 116, respectively (P< 0. 001 for the same comparison), with similar findings in all subgroups. The higher charges and costs for <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy were due to higher supply costs, particularly when disposable supplies were used, and to longer operating-room time. CONCLUSIONS: Despite shorter hospital stays, in-hospital charges and costs for <b>laparoscopically</b> <b>assisted</b> vaginal hysterectomy are higher than for either alternative procedure, because of the disposable supplies that are typically used and the longer operating-room time...|$|R
