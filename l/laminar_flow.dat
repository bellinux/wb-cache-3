From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer.

5|$|Krueger flap and Natural <b>Laminar</b> <b>Flow</b> Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural <b>Laminar</b> <b>Flow</b> to reduce fuel burn.|$|E

5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of <b>laminar</b> <b>flow.</b> However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} methodology {{has been}} developed to solve steady <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> in two-dimensional domains of arbitrary shape using body-fitted coordinates. The finite volume procedure was used to discretize the governing equations. Contravariant velocity fluxes were used as the dependent variables in the momentum equations, which retain a strongly conservative form in general curvilinear coordinates. Since non-staggered grids were used, a momentum interpolation was employed to suppress the pressure oscillation. A hybrid differencing scheme was employed to treat the convection-diffusion terms in the momentum equations. The capability of this method to predict flow characteristics in complex geometries was demonstrated by solving four typical fluid flow problems. They are <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> between two concentric cylinders, <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> through a channel with gradual expansion, <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> inside a tube with a constriction and separated flows in a lid-driven cavity.

The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic compensation of path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain <b>laminar</b> <b>flow.</b> This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

40|$|Bedload {{transport}} generally {{depends on}} the bed shear stress and Reynolds number. Many studies conducted for the condition of turbulent flows have revealed the dependence of the transport rate on the bed shear stress, while knowledge of the Reynolds number effect on the transport rate is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> is considered in this paper. A stochastic approach is adopted to explore how the transport rate {{can be associated with}} characteristics of <b>laminar</b> <b>flows.</b> First, the probability of erosion in the absence of turbulence is assumed to depend only on the randomness of bed particles. The probability is then applied to formulate the sediment transport rate, of which the derivation is made largely based on Einstein’s bedload theory. The theoretical result indicates that the dimensionless transport rate for <b>laminar</b> <b>flows</b> is dependent on the dimensionless shear stress and dimensionless particle diameter or the shear Reynolds number. Comparisons are finally made between the derived formula and an empirical correlation available in the literature...|$|R

The experimental data obtained are compared with existing data and predictions by many correlations.

In addition, there are a few heat transfer correlations applicable to narrow rectangular channels.
