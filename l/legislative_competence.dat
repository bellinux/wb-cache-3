40|$|Two {{features}} of German federalism {{have been the}} subject of much criticism in recent years, the veto power of the Bundesrat and the centralization of <b>legislative</b> <b>competences.</b> The former is made responsible for the (in) famous German ‘Reformstau’, the latter for severely limiting autonomous policy-making, and thus innovation, at the Länder level. The paper argues that both complaints about the federal system are exaggerated. Neither does the bicameral structure completely block reforms, nor are the Länder immobilized by the corset of centralized legislation. But as long as the Länder make little use of existing opportunities for policy competition and learning, Germany is also clearly not benefiting fully from the advantages of federalism...|$|R

For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland. However, {{under the terms of the}} Scotland Acts, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. Such [...] "devolved matters" [...] include education, health, agriculture and justice. The Scotland Act 1998 enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues. A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has tax powers. Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of Germany's federalism have been long identified {{as one of}} the main obstacles to legitimate and efficient governance. In 2006, the grand coalition adopted a federal reform which aims to disentangle the intertwined levels of government by reducing the influence of the Länder governments in federal policy-making and strengthening the Länder by granting more <b>legislative</b> <b>competences</b> to the federal states. In this article, I summarize the reasons for the constitutional change, provide a short overview of the reform process, and evaluate its results.

As is demonstrated in this article, it was essentially the normalization of emergency powers that made the transition towards a more centralized government possible.

It analyzes two opportunity structures through which regions can participate in EU policy-control, i. e. the national parliamentary channel and the Subsidiarity Monitoring Network of the Committee of the Regions. The findings reveal that regional participation in the EWS is considerably limited and disproportionate both between and within the Member States, thus bringing to light new challenges for the implementation of a multilevel inter-parliamentary cooperation in European affairs.
