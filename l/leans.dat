5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider <b>leans</b> to the right relative to the bike, the bike <b>leans</b> to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E

The significant contribution {{of this paper is}} the ISM Model for sustainable <b>Lean</b> implementation. The ISM-based <b>Lean</b> implementation structure offers greater understanding of implementation process at more microlevel as compared to UNIDO–ACMA Model. ISM Model focuses on successful implementation of <b>Lean</b> in a company where as UNIDO–ACMA seeks sustenance of <b>Lean</b> practices throughout the cluster. To implement <b>Lean</b> successfully, sustenance of <b>Lean</b> practices and perfection at each phase are absolutely essential. ISM-based <b>Lean</b> model advocates implementation of eight <b>Lean</b> practice bundles in sequential order.

5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire <b>leans</b> from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lean</b> Manufacturing (LM) {{has been}} used in {{production}} processes to help manufacturing companies maintain competitive advantages for decades. However, with the increasingly fierce competition and pressure to sustain survival and long-term growth, enterprises cannot be satisfied with just improving the performance of a single process. Therefore, adoption of <b>lean</b> to the whole product development processes has become a necessity. There is evidence that <b>lean</b> thinking and some <b>lean</b> manufacturing tools are able to improve Product Development (PD) processes. Thus, terms of <b>Lean</b> Product Development (<b>Lean</b> PD) and <b>Lean</b> Product and Process Development (<b>Lean</b> PPD) are becoming popular in engineering fields. In this project, the research aimed to improve the tooling design situation in Chinese aerospace by implementing <b>lean</b> techniques to the design process. Tooling is an indispensible part of aircraft manufacturing and assembly. The quality and development time can influence aircraft quality and delivery time. However, there is little research about the <b>lean</b> techniques implementation based on aircraft tooling design characteristics and there are few <b>lean</b> frameworks for aircraft tooling design process. Therefore, this research will be conducted to fill this gap. The research comprised four phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature review about <b>lean</b> (<b>lean</b> thinking and <b>lean</b> manufacturing), <b>Lean</b> PD and <b>Lean</b> PPD, tooling design, <b>lean</b> models/frameworks and the relationship between <b>lean</b> and organisational culture was conducted. In the second phase, data and information from three Chinese aircraft manufacturing companies (Company A, B and C) and literature were collected and analysed, aiming to discover the current <b>lean</b> implementation status in tooling design process and find improvement opportunities. In the third stage, a <b>lean</b> framework for tooling design process was synthesised. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by academic and industry experts. Finally, the research can contribute to companies which need a <b>lean</b> transformation. Moreover, the <b>lean</b> framework also {{could be used as a}} reference for research in <b>lean</b> and tooling design field...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Since the {{introduction}} of <b>lean</b> manufacturing by Toyota and publication by Womack and Jones, organizations have realized sizeable gains through <b>lean</b> process improvement. The spread of <b>lean</b> practices across organizations and industries – from manufacturing to healthcare and construction – requires adjustments of the <b>lean</b> process and, {{in the case of}} construction engineering, modification of the traditional <b>lean</b> paradigm (stationary product versus the traditional mobile product). Consequently, success in <b>lean</b> manufacturing projects is closer to 20 %, and less than 2 % of manufacturing jobs in the United States are truly <b>lean.</b> Previous studies show that this unsatisfactory result occurs because mangers use inappropriate practices and rely solely on financial measures and consequent performance measures. This leads to an overall lack of synchronization between <b>lean</b> goals and actual practices. Given the challenges associated with adopting <b>lean</b> and synchronizing strategy beyond financial measures, this study attempts to resolve the confusion surrounding <b>lean</b> implementation by providing a systematic, clear description of effective and efficient routes through which organizations in different industries (or sectors) can adopt appropriate <b>lean</b> strategies. The following steps are taken to resolve the confusion in <b>lean</b> implementation: (a) a literature review of <b>lean</b> principles, <b>lean</b> practices, performance measures and performance measurement system; (b) an investigating of <b>lean</b> principles to integrate the literature with a survey of <b>lean</b> experts; (c) creation of a <b>lean</b> conceptual map that integrates <b>lean</b> principles with <b>lean</b> practices and performance measures; (d) incorporation of the <b>lean</b> balanced scorecard as a performance measurement system based on validated performance measures obtained through a survey of different manufacturing sectors in the United States; (e) identification of causal relationship between <b>lean</b> principles using Decision Making Trial Evaluation Laboratory method (DEMATEL), to construct an industry-specific strategy map with information from a survey of <b>lean</b> manufacturing companies in the United States (f) an investigating of the difference between the strategy maps constructed for each sector, and the cause and the central factors for each <b>lean</b> sector; and (g) a suggestion of an effective <b>lean</b> strategy for each sector. This thesis identifies a path for management to better invest resources in the aspects of <b>lean</b> implementation that are in acute need of improvement, by focusing on the most salient and central <b>lean</b> objectives.

40|$|<b>Lean</b> {{construction}} borrows concepts from <b>lean</b> {{manufacturing and}} Toyota Production System {{in order to}} eliminate waste and add value to the construction process. Manufacturing processes utilizing <b>lean</b> principles have matured and developed {{a clear understanding of}} the relation between <b>lean</b> and safety. Because <b>lean</b> in construction is a relatively new phenomenon, there is not a completely developed understanding of how <b>lean</b> practices affect safety in construction. The <b>Lean</b> Construction Institute and the Academic Forum for <b>Lean</b> Construction has recently targeted this area for focused research. Since all safety incidents imply waste in time and resources, <b>lean</b> and safety have a common ground in the minimization of waste. This thesis researches the common ground of <b>lean</b> and safety in waste minimization and proposes a framework for understanding their relationship. This thesis also critically analyzes <b>lean</b> and safety principles to form an insight to the relationship between <b>lean</b> theories as well as practices and safety issues reported in construction literature. Further, literature also revealed the safety strategies and checklists that companies typically incorporate in their program. A comparative analysis of <b>lean</b> and safety is employed to understand their relations in a better way. This framework establishes that <b>lean</b> and safety have a strong relationship in the context of construction. Future work is needed to show that <b>lean</b> practices indeed strongly affect safety by reducing the number of incidents...|$|R
