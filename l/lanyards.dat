25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord <b>lanyards.</b> It also allows easy swapping of <b>lanyards</b> without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E
25|$|When blown by the wind, flags {{are subject}} to wave-like motions that grow in {{amplitude}} {{along the length of}} the flag. This is sometimes ascribed to the flag pole giving vortex shedding; however, flags that are held by <b>lanyards</b> also can be seen to flap.|$|E

At the theater, <b>Lanyard</b> discovers the diamonds are sewn into her mink coat but before he can leave her dressing room, Iris enters and admits that Robards had given her the diamonds. While <b>Lanyard</b> phones Jamison, Iris sneaks out an open window and heads {{to the airport to}} catch a flight out of the country.|$|R
25|$|All {{employees}} of the U.S. Virgin Megastores could be identified by their trademark red or black t-shirts which had the Virgin logo {{on the front and}} the word STAFF on the back, as well as required <b>lanyards</b> with their first name printed on them.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} {{to the small}} size of flash drives is that they are easily misplaced, left behind, or otherwise lost. This is a particular problem if the data they contain are sensitive (see data security). As a consequence, some manufacturers have added encryption hardware to their drives—although software encryption systems which can be used in conjunction with any mass storage medium achieve the same thing. Most drives can be attached to keychains, necklaces and <b>lanyards.</b> The USB plug is usually fitted with a removable protective cap, or is retractable.|$|E
25|$|When {{converted}} to the RA, {{there was a}} shortage of insignia, so on 27 March 1942 the troops were ordered {{to cut off the}} 'KING'S' and 'L.I.' from the ends of their cloth shoulder titles, leaving 'SHROPSHIRE', which led to the regiment's nickname 'the Shropshire Gunners'. They were allowed to keep their light infantry green Field service caps instead of the RA's red and blue, and officers could retain their green <b>lanyards</b> and KSLI buttons. All ranks exchanged their KSLI cap badges for RA 'gun' or 'bomb' badges. Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert devised a distinctive embroidered arm badge for the regiment, of a light infantry bugle-horn embroidered in gold on a green background. This was worn throughout the unit's service in the RA.|$|E

50|$|To avoid {{losing the}} reel, a <b>lanyard</b> {{may be used}} to attach the diving reel to the diver. This <b>lanyard</b> can clip to the {{buoyancy}} compensator or go around the wrist. Alternatively, the <b>lanyard</b> can be long enough to float above the diver and stay out of the way. If the <b>lanyard</b> clips to the buoyancy compensator, the user should take care to release if there is surface boating activity, as boats may drag divers up by their SMB reels.|$|R
25|$|The {{company was}} marching from Melville Barracks to the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, {{to attend a}} boxing tournament. It was divided into three platoons; the rear platoon {{consisted}} of new recruits {{who had not yet}} received uniforms. They were generally under the command of cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs); the only adult present was the contingent adjutant, Lieutenant Clarence Murrayfield Carter, a regular Royal Marines officer. The column was about fifteen yards long and was marching three abreast on the left-hand side of the road. It was showing no lights, there being no official requirement to do so, and the boys in uniform were wearing Royal Marines standard-issue dark blue battledress and berets, although they had white belts and white <b>lanyards</b> on their shoulders.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a tassel is {{attached}} to the hilt. During the Ming Dynasty these were usually passed through an openwork pommel, and in the Qing {{through a hole in the}} grip itself; modern swords usually attach the tassel to the end of the pommel. Historically these were likely used as <b>lanyards,</b> allowing the wielder to retain the sword in combat. There are some sword forms which utilize the tassel as an integral part of their swordsmanship style (sometimes offensively), while other schools dispense with sword tassels entirely. The movement of the tassel may have served to distract opponents, and some schools further claim that metal wires or thin silk cords were once worked into the tassels for impairing vision and causing bleeding when swept across the face. The tassel's use now is primarily decorative.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the uniforms}} {{worn by the}} Australian Army have changed {{significantly}} over the past century, the accoutrements worn over this period have remained relatively similar. In the British Army regiments have traditionally often worn their own distinctive uniforms. However, in contrast {{there is very little}} practical difference between the dress of each unit in the Australian Army, with the majority of personnel wearing the same basic uniform (although there are some minor exceptions, worn on general duties and ceremonial uniforms—but not DPCU when worn as dress of the day or in the field—for instance with some units wearing black badges of rank, unit badges and other accoutrements, instead of the usual gold and yellow or silver and white worn respectively by all corps, while a number of Scottish companies and pipes and drum bands wear distinctive tartans and other items of traditional dress, including headdress, highland dress jacket, kilt, sporran, hose-top socks, and gaiters). Instead, the main uniform distinctions between corps and units include corps and regimental badges, berets, <b>lanyards,</b> and unit colour patches.|$|E

5000|$|Back at his hotel, <b>Lanyard</b> {{receives}} {{a call from}} Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him {{to stay away from}} the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. <b>Lanyard</b> decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang (Paul Fung), a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to <b>Lanyard</b> but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton (Richard Fraser), Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on <b>Lanyard.</b> At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed <b>Lanyard.</b> When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone. Woolerton claims Robards pushed him out of the car on the outskirts, and said he suspects <b>Lanyard</b> was the murderer.|$|R
25|$|Corps and regimental badges {{include both}} hat and collar badges (usually smaller {{versions}} of the hat badge). The majority of corps badges in the Australian Army are copied from the badges of the equivalent corps in the British Army. Berets include the general duty dark blue (worn by service corps and others not eligible to wear a special-to-corps or unit beret), while other colours include black (armoured corps), rifle green (Royal Australian Regiment), fawn or sand / tan (SASR), Sherwood green (commandos), maroon or dull cherry (airborne), scarlet (military police), slate grey (nursing corps) and light blue (aviation and personnel on service with the United Nations). <b>Lanyards</b> vary in colour by corps and unit are mostly worn on the right shoulder, although units of the infantry corps wear them on the left, as do {{some members of the}} artillery, and the Australian Federation Guard. Different colours and designs are allocated to each corps and many units. Unit colour patches were re-introduced in 1987 for units that could trace their lineage back to units of either the 1st or 2nd AIF, while the current Series II colour patch was adopted in 1995, introducing a system of patches designed for all units and organisations of the Army. At this time the practice of wearing patches on the shoulder ceased, and they were worn on the right-hand side of the puggaree on the slouch hat instead.|$|E
500|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} {{was issued}} with a clamshell holster {{similar to the}} French Modèle 1892 revolver. [...] The earliest Type 26 holsters were black, and the cotton <b>lanyards</b> issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon. A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of holsters are stamped {{on the inside of}} the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with the year of manufacture. [...] Very early holsters, issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod. A few holsters developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. Holsters produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late production Type 94 Nambu pistol holsters, with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition.|$|E

50|$|A <b>lanyard</b> is a {{short cord}} {{attached}} to something to enable it to be handled or secured. In {{the case of the}} Regimental <b>Lanyard</b> it is the whistle which has to be secured. Therefore, the wearing of a <b>lanyard</b> without a whistle is considered as improper.The Regimental <b>Lanyard</b> is 24 inches long including the hook. It is made of black cotton-cum-woolen material and has three black knots. The first knot is fitted one inch below the loop holding the hook, the other being the runners showing from under the armpit and the other in between the two.|$|R

Jobs's contributions to most of his patents were to [...] "the look and feel of the product." [...] His industrial design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with him for 200 of the patents. Most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed to utility patents (inventions). He has 43 issued US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with [...] "magnification" [...] feature was issued the day before he died. Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers, Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.|$|E
2500|$|While dao {{have varied}} greatly over the centuries, most single-handed dao of the Ming period and later, {{and the modern}} swords that are based [...] on them share a number of characteristics. Dao blades are {{moderately}} curved and single-edged, though often with {{a few inches of}} the back edge sharpened as well; the moderate curve allows them to be reasonably effective in the thrust. Hilts are sometimes canted, curving in the opposite direction as the blade which improves handling in some forms of cuts and thrusts. Cord is usually wrapped over the wood of the handle. Hilts may also be pierced like those of jian (straight-bladed Chinese sword) for the addition of <b>lanyards,</b> though modern swords for performances will often have tassels or scarves instead. Guards are typically disc-shaped often with a cupped shape to prevent rainwater from getting into the sheath, and to prevent blood from dripping down to the handle, making it more difficult to grip. Sometimes guards are thinner pieces of metal with an s-curve, the lower limb of the curve protecting the user's knuckles; very rarely they may have guards like those of the jian.|$|E

5000|$|The diamond knot (or knife <b>lanyard</b> knot) is a knot for {{forming a}} {{decorative}} loop {{on the end}} of a cord such as on a <b>lanyard.</b> [...] A similar knot, also called the diamond knot, is a multistrand stopper knot, that is similar in appearance (although the footrope knot is really more similar, but it is simply an upside down diamond knot). To avoid confusion, it is advisable to call this knot the knife <b>lanyard</b> knot. This knot is a four strand diamond knot implemented in two strands.
