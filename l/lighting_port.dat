Up to 40 % of the ring circumference is available for insertion devices. The lattice has been obtained by giving up the constraint of zero dispersion in the straight sections. However, for many SR experiments, the resulting reduction in brilliance is not of importance. An application of the PID structure for a 3 GeV storage ring is presented and discussed.
