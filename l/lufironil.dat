40|$|Summary: During the {{toxicological}} {{examination of}} the fibrosuppressive agent, <b>Lufironil</b> (INN), in rats a dose-dependent positive reaction for urinary bilirubin was observed. This positive reaction was found in quantitative assays, and when using test Strips. The positive reaction for bilirubin in these assay Systems {{was caused by a}} metabolite of <b>Lufironil.</b> It was not due to drug toxicity, and it was not caused by any endogenous Substrate produced under the influence of <b>Lufironil.</b> The cömpound responsible for this reaction was isolated by HPLC and its structure determined by spectroscopic rnethods. The structure was confirmed by syrithesis, starting from pyridine- 2, 4 -dicarboxylate. The synthesized cöm-pound and the cömpound in urine gave an identical reaction with the test reagent for bilirubin...|$|E
