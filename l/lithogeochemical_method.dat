40|$|Alteration zones (more {{commonly}} {{foot wall}} alteration zones) {{are related to}} volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposits and represent unique features that may be targeted during exploration. Of these, the chloritic foot wall alteration pipe is the most extensive and characteristic of VMS deposits. This feature is geochemically identified by a strong relative enrichment in aluminium and magnesium and a coupled depletion in calcium and sodium, giving rise to chloritic rocks in the primary environment of formation. During high grade regional metamorphism such chloritic precursor rock types are replaced by an unusual mineral paragenesis, typically containing magnesium rich cordierite, phlogopite, orthoamphiboles or orthopyroxenes and aluminium rich minerals such as sillimanite and corundum. This suggests that the unusual geochemical features of the alteration zone, retained during the deformation and metamorphism, should be recognisable in lithogeochemical exploration. The massive sulfide deposit {{in the eastern part}} of the metamorphic Namaqua Province, South Africa, at Areachap, Kantienpan and the defunct Prieska Cu–Zn Mine are hosted by a Mid-Proterozoic volcano sedimentary succession known as the Areachap Group. These deposits were affected by a complex deformation and metamorphic history and represent examples of upper amphibolite to granulite grade metamorphosed VMS deposits. The application of the known lithogeochemical methods is especially complicated where the geology is not well understood, due to the poor rock exposure of complexly deformed and metamorphosed areas, such as {{in the eastern part of}} the Namaqua Province. The box plot presents a more readily applicable <b>lithogeochemical</b> <b>method</b> to characterize and identify the alteration process, but it was designed for relatively un-metamorphosed environments. It is demonstrated here that the box plot may also be applied to high-grade metamorphic terrains and that the mineral phases used in defining the boxplot in low grade metamorphic environments may be replaced by their equivalents in high grade metamorphic terrains. The compositional trends of the metamorphic minerals themselves may be used in defining the boxplot for high grade metamorphic terrains. These include the transition of: annite to phlogopite; grossular to almandine or pyrope, augite to enstatite or clinoenstatite, and hornblende to gedrite or cummingtonite. Close to the ore zone, the relative Mg content of pyroxene, cordierite and biotite are higher than further away from this zone. It could be demonstrated that the changes in the mineral compositions are gradational when comparing unaffected rocks with progressively more altered wall rocks. Conclusions based on an application of the isocon method demonstrate that primary footwall alteration zones in the Areachap Group's VMS deposits are characterized by elemental depletion of Na 2 O, CaO, Sr, Ni, V and La and enrichment of MgO, Fe 2 O 3 (total), S, Zn, SiO 2, Co and F. It is shown that the whole rock compositions of rocks that were independently identified as the metamorphic equivalents of altered rocks, using the isocon method, plot in the correct place in the box plot for high grade regionally metamorphosed terrains. This establishes the box plot as an effective and practical tool for lithogeochemical exploration for VMS deposits in complexly deformed high grade metamorphosed terrains.

40|$|Petiknäs South is a {{producing}} {{underground mine}} {{in the eastern part}} of the Skellefte district and contained 6 Mt of pyritic massive sulfide ore grading 5 % Zn, 1 % Cu, 1 % Pb, 2. 5 g/t Au and 105 g/t Ag prior to mining. The deposit is hosted within volcanic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Skellefte Group and consists of several stacked ore lenses (from oldest to youngest: C, B, D and A). The mine sequence comprises coherent and volcaniclastic units of rhyolitic to basaltic andesitic composition, and post-ore andesite sills and mafic dykes. The mine stratigraphy dips subvertically and youngs consistently southwards and the volcanic rocks have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. Application of immobile-element <b>lithogeochemical</b> <b>methods</b> to 469 samples has allowed classification of the mine sequence into a series of chemostratigraphic units, while the degree of hydrothermal alteration of these units has been quantified using mass change methods. The main alteration minerals are sericite, chlorite, garnet, quartz and locally carbonate. Intense chlorite-garnet alteration occurs immediately below the A and D ore lenses, and in the distal footwall of the C and B ore lenses. A synvolcanic felsic sill was emplaced in the proximal footwall slightly after formation of the massive sulfide lenses. Consequently, a major part of the proximal footwall is only weakly altered and zones of strong alteration are truncated by the sill. The alteration zones are interpreted as hydrothermal upflow or feeder zones. Haloes of serizitization occur around the ore lenses and are wider than the zones of chlorite-garnet alteration and alteration zones with Na 2 O and CaO depletions occur on a semi-regional scale, but are most intense close to the ores. Alteration zones below and around the ore lenses are characterized by large mass gains of FeO, MnO, MgO and K 2 O together with large mass gains or losses in silica. The latter alteration zones are approximately three times larger than the actual ore lenses, and consequently could provide a good exploration guide to ore. Godkänd; 2006; 20111007 (andbra...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In {{remote sensing}} studies, {{especially}} those in which multi-spectral image data are used, (i. e., Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper), various statistical methods are often applied for image enhancement and feature extraction (Reddy, 2008). Principal component analysis is a multivariate statistical technique which is frequently used in multidimensional data analysis. This method attempts to extract and place the spectral information into a smaller set of new components that are more interpretable. However, the results obtained from this method are not so straightforward and require somewhat sophisticated techniques to interpret (Drury, 2001). In this paper we present a new approach for mapping of hydrothermal alteration by analyzing and selecting the principal components extracted through processing of Landsat ETM+ images. The study area {{is located in a}} mountainous region of southern Kerman. Geologically, it lies in the volcanic belt of central Iran adjacent to the Gogher-Baft ophiolite zone. The region is highly altered with sericitic, propyliticand argillic alterationwell developed, and argillic alteration is limited (Jafari, 2009; Masumi and Ranjbar, 2011). Multispectral data of Landsat ETM+ was acquired (path 181, row 34) in this study. In these images the color composites of Band 7, Band 4 and Band 1 in RGB indicate the lithology outcropping in the study area. The principal component analysis (PCA) ofimage data is often implemented computationally using three steps: (1) Calculation of the variance, covariance matrix or correlation matrix of the satellite sensor data. (2) Computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix or correlation matrix, and (3) Linear transformation of the image data using the coefficients of the eigenvector matrix. Results By applying PCA to the spectral data, according to the eigenvectors obtained, 6 principal components were extracted from the data set. In the PCA matrix, theeigen vector differences between the means of the level of significance between two bands (or spectral significance of the PC). The higher value is regarded as the Target Value of the bands which show a lower correlation. The components having maximum spectral significance of PCs, in bands 1 and 3, 5 and 7 and 5 and 3, were selected for enhancement of iron oxides, clay minerals and carbonate minerals, respectively. In each PC matrix, the sum of the significances is regarded as the spectral weight of that PC. The spectral weight of the extracted PCs, was found to be as follows: PC 5 > PC 4 >PC 2 >PC 3 >PC 7 >PC 1 The inverse PC 4 and –PC 3 provide valuable information on vegetation mapping. In order to map the alteration zones and igneous rocks outcropped in the study area, the color composites of the PC 5, -PC 4 and average of each PC are included in RGB, respectively. The spectral proportion of each PC pertaining to each mineral was calculated as spectral significance in the two bands (e. g. Bands 5 and 7 for clay minerals and Bands 3 and 1 for Fe oxide minerals) divided by spectral weight of that PC. Based on the obtained results, the selectivity of the extracted components for enhancement of clay minerals and Fe oxide minerals was calculated and images of these minerals were produced using the following expressions: Fe oxide minerals: Clay minerals: For carbonate minerals, the proportion of each PC is calculated in terms of the eigenvectors of bands 5 and 3. The selectivity of the PCs used in enhancing of spectral data of carbonate minerals is as follows: PC 5 >PC 2 >PC 1 >PC 3 >PC 4 >PC 7 In the remotely sensed image, PC 5 with high spectral weight was selected as the informative PC for clay minerals, iron oxides and carbonate minerals. This is becausepropylitic alteration and the formation of carbonate minerals can be easily enhanced in the processed images. Eventually, overlapping of the processed images provides patterns of hydrothermal alterationwhich indicate the areas to be prospected. In order to validate the obtained results of the image processing with geological evidence,petrographic studies of rock samples collected from major outcrops in the study area were made. It was found that quartz, calcite, epidote, sericite and chlorite are the main constituents of sericiticand propylitic alteration assemblages in the study area. The minerals are virtually enhanced in Landsat ETM+ using the proposed methods and confirm the results obtained from multispectral data analysis. Conclusion This study provides a new and improved approach to obtain the most meaningful spectral data for oxides, carbonates and clay minerals in multispectral images. As these minerals are typically found in hydrothermal alteration, the method presented in this article can be used for enhancement of such mineral spectral data, which can be very helpful in prospecting and exploration for hidden mineral deposits.

40|$|The Skellefte {{district}} {{is one of}} the most important mining regions in Sweden and Europe. The district contains more than 85 pyritic Zn-Cu-Au-Ag massive sulfide deposits. The discovery of new ores, which likely are located > 200 m below surface is a challenge and requires improved exploration methods, which in turn require a better understanding of the geology and alteration patterns of known volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposits in the district. The Petiknäs South ore deposit lies in the eastern part of the Skellefte district. Between 1992 and 2006, 5. 3 Mt of ore grading 4. 9 % Zn, 0. 9 % Cu, 0. 9 % Pb, 31 % S, 2. 4 g/t Au and 102 g/t Ag were mined in an underground operation by Boliden Mineral AB. The ores are pyritic massive sulfides, hosted within altered, deformed and metamorphosed volcanic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Skellefte Group. The deposit contained several ore lenses at three stratigraphic levels. This study indicates that the Petiknäs South ore deposit occurs on the southern limb of a steeply plunging, tight, upright, F 2 -anticline. The mine stratigraphy dips subvertically and youngs consistently southwards. A major thrust fault truncates the down-dip portion of the deposit at the 700 m level. The rocks generally show one penetrative tectonic foliation and have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. The following six mine-scale units occur from north to south (footwall to hanging-wall) : diffusely stratified andesite breccias (Unit 1 a), thick dacitic pumice breccia (Unit 1 b) overlain by feldspar-porphyritic rhyolitic domes and sills with hyaloclastitic and peperitic contacts (top of Unit 1 b and Unit 1 d), the B-C ore lens enveloped by a thin screen of reworked rhyolitic volcaniclastic rocks (Unit 2), thick andesitic and basaltic andesitic pumiceous mass-flow deposits (Unit 3), volcanic sandstones and siltstones containing large quartz-phyric pumice clasts, and strongly altered volcanic rocks enveloping the D-, and A-ore lenses (Unit 4), and finally the hanging-wall complex comprising feldspar-quartz porphyritic rhyolite sills (Unit 5). The andesite breccias, dacite pumice breccia and high-Ti rhyolites (Units 1 a and 1 b) represent an andesite-dacite-rhyolite shield volcano whereas the feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite (Unit 1 d) corresponds to a cryptodome-sill-tuff volcano with peperitic margins. The rhyolitic sandstones (Unit 2) were emplaced via turbidity currents under subaqueous conditions below wave base and the main B-C ore lens formed at the sea-floor within this facies. The intermediate mass-flow breccias (Unit 3) were rapidly emplaced in subaqueous conditions following a pyroclastic eruption and the host unit of the D-, and A-ore lenses (Unit 4) was deposited by turbidity currents below wave base. The hanging-wall fault causes repetition of Units 3 and 4. The rhyolitic sills of the hanging-wall complex (Unit 5) were intruded into wet volcaniclastic sediments. Post-ore and post-alteration andesite and felsic sills and mafic dykes (Unit 6) intruded most of the mine sequence. Lithogeochemical studies show that the thick andesite and dacite breccias, and rhyolites of the lower footwall (Units 1 a, 1 b) belong to a high-TiO 2 fractionation trend, whereas rocks of the upper footwall (Unit 1 d), the host unit to the B-C ore lenses (Unit 2) and most of the felsic rocks higher in the stratigraphy belong to a low-TiO 2 trend. This change from a high-TiO 2 to a low TiO 2 series corresponds closely to the change from an early andesite-dacite-rhyolite shield volcano to a later rhyolitic cryptodome-sill-tuff volcano. The B-C ore horizon is considered the most favorable stratigraphic horizon for mineral exploration and lies between calc-alkaline to transitional, felsic volcanic rocks (Unit 2) and tholeiitic, basaltic-andesitic and andesitic juvenile mass-flow deposits (Unit 3) that were derived from a different and relatively distal volcanic center. This ore horizon can be traced along strike for several hundred meters and its position has also been located on the northern limb of the regional anticline, 700 m north of Petiknäs South. Furthermore, the Petiknäs South ore horizon can be correlated with the ore horizon of the Renström mine which is located 2 km to the east. These extensions of the Petiknäs South ore horizon provide potential drill targets for new VMS ore lenses. Application of immobile-element <b>lithogeochemical</b> <b>methods</b> has allowed definition of a series of chemostratigraphic units, which can be correlated throughout and beyond the mine, even where the rocks are strongly altered. At the Kristineberg and Rävliden mines in the western part of the Skellefte district it has been shown that lithogeochemical techniques can also be applied to intensely altered rocks that have been metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The chemostratigraphic correlations at Petiknäs South support and verify the volcanic-stratigraphic correlations based on lithology and facies. The results show that the ore lenses occur at different stratigraphic positions within clastic stratigraphic intervals of dominantly rhyolitic composition. Six alteration types have been distinguished based on mineral assemblage. Intense chlorite-sericite-quartz-garnet±feldspar alteration is found immediately below the ore lenses and locally in the distal footwall and represents the strongest alteration. These zones are interpreted to represent the upflow zones of hot hydrothermal fluids. Haloes of sericite alteration occur around the ore lenses and are wider than the zones of chlorite-sericite-garnet. Mass change calculations show that alteration zones below the ore lenses are characterized by large mass gains of FeO, MnO, MgO and K 2 O together with large mass gains or losses in silica. The latter alteration zones are about three times larger than the actual ore lenses, and consequently could provide a good exploration guide to ore. Other alteration zones with Na 2 O and CaO depletions occur on a semi-regional scale, but are most intense close to the ores. Surprisingly, the proximal part of the footwall complex, which is dominated by syn-volcanic felsic intrusions, is only weakly altered, which suggests that these intrusions were emplaced slightly after formation of the massive sulfide lenses at the waning stage of hydrothermal alteration. The Manus basin in Papua New Guinea is a back-arc basin where VMS ores are presently forming and represents a good modern analogue to the Petiknäs South ores. The rocks from the Manus basin are basalt, basaltic-andesite, andesite and rhyodacite, similar to rocks from the Petiknäs South mine sequence, and the ores are located just above a felsic proximal facies association. The results of this study can be used to help identify (1) felsic proximal facies associations, (2) ore horizons and (3) favorable hydrothermal alteration zones, in other parts of the Skellefte district and elsewhere.

40|$|The main {{exploration}} methods {{which have}} been used in the Skellefte district are prospecting for ore boulders in young glacial deposits and electrical geophysical methods. The discovery of new ores which likely are located at deep levels (> 200 m), requires improved exploration methods, which in turn require {{a better understanding of the}} geology and alteration patterns of the known VMS deposits. This thesis seeks to improve the understanding of the geology and alteration patterns of VMS deposits in the Skellefte district by providing new data and new interpretation of the geology and alteration system of the Petiknäs South VMS deposit. The Skellefte district is an important ore province, containing more than 80 pyritic Zn-Cu-Au-Ag massive sulfide deposits within volcanic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Skellefte Group. The Petiknäs South volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposit is a producing underground mine in the eastern part of the Paleoproterozoic Skellefte district. The deposit consists of several ore lenses (A, B, C and D) and prior to mining contained 6 Mt of ore grading 5 % Zn, 1 % Cu, 1 % Pb, 2. 5 g/t Au and 105 g/t Ag. The deposit occurs on the southern limb of a tight, steeply plunging, upright, anticline. The mine stratigraphy dips subvertically and youngs consistently southwards. A major thrust fault truncates the downdip portion of the deposit at the 700 m level of the mine. The volcanic rocks of the mine sequence generally have one penetrative tectonic foliation and have been metamorphosed to greenschist facies, although garnet-biotite bearing rocks are present locally. Application of immobile-element <b>lithogeochemical</b> <b>methods</b> to 469 samples has allowed classification of the mine sequence into a series of chemostratigraphic units, while the degree of hydrothermal alteration of these units has been quantified using mass change methods. From oldest to youngest, the main units are: The footwall complex (Unit 1) consists of rhyolite B and minor rhyolite C, B/C, and dacite feldspar-porphyritic rhyolitic cryptodomes, sills and volcaniclastic rocks, and is overlain by rhyolitic sandstone-siltstone beds, an up to 20 m thick unit hosting the B/C ore lens (Unit 2). The B/C ore lenses formed a single lens prior to intrusion of the late andesite sills. Unit 2 is overlain by unmineralized basaltic andesite volcaniclastic rocks (Unit 3). Above this, Unit 4 is host to the D and A ore lenses. This unit comprises mainly rhyolitic volcaniclastics with several thin andesitic intercalations. A WNW-ESE trending fault separates Unit 4 from Unit 5, which comprises feldspar-quartz porphyritic rhyolite sills and sandstone- siltstone volcaniclastic rocks. The lower part of Unit 5 is a mass flow deposit of distinctive low-Ti mafic composition that can be traced for 700 m eastwards from the proximal part of the mine. Unit 6 comprises the post- ore andesite sills and mafic dykes. A portion of the chemostratigraphic sequence (Units 1 and 2) has also been recognized on the northern limb of the Petiknäs South anticline. In summary, 6 chemostratigraphic units can be identified at the Petiknäs South mine and these can be correlated throughout and beyond the mine, even where they are strongly altered. Two good chemostratigraphic marker horizons were identified: one is of basaltic andesite and andesite composition (unit 3) and one is of low-Ti mafic composition (unit 5 a) and both markers can be correlated on the mine-scale and semi-regional scale. The chemostratigraphic results show that ore lenses (B/C, D and A) occur at different stratigraphic positions within clastic stratigraphic intervals of dominantly rhyolitic composition. The most favorable exploration horizon (the B/C ore horizon) is located at the contact between a felsic clastic and a basaltic-andesitic clastic unit. Based on identification of magmatic affinity, chemostratigraphy revealed that the volcanic succession at Petiknäs South comprises calc-alkaline to transitional footwall rocks representing a proximal facies association and this succession is overlain by tholeiitc juvenile volcaniclastic rocks which were derived from a different and relatively distal volcanic center. In terms of ore location chemostratigraphy revealed that the main ore body at Petiknäs South is located at the contact between rhyolitic calc-alkaline to transitional and basaltic-andesitic tholeiitic rocks. This ore horizon can be traced along strike for several hundred meters and its position has also been located on the northern limb of the regional anticline, 700 m north of Petiknäs South. These extensions of the Petiknäs South ore horizon are potential drill targets for new VMS ore lenses. The main alteration minerals are sericite, quartz, chlorite, garnet, and locally carbonate. Intense chlorite-garnet alteration occurs immediately below the A and D ore lenses, and in the distal footwall of the B and C ore lenses. These zones are interpreted as hydrothermal upflow or feeder zones. Haloes of serizitization occur around the ore lenses and are wider than the zones of chlorite-garnet alteration. Carbonatization occurs in narrow zones throughout the mine sequence. Sericitic alteration in felsic footwall rocks that show only small mass changes in K and Si is explained by hydration at low water/rock ratios. By contrast sericitic altered felsic rocks immediately below the B/C ore lens show large gains in K and Si and are attributed to alteration by hot fluids. Restoration of the Petiknäs South stratigraphy and alteration system prior to deformation indicates that the Petiknäs South deposit originally contained three stacked ore lenses: from oldest to youngest, the B/C, D and A lenses. The B/C and the A ore lens were formed at the seafloor above a zone of hydrothermal upflow and the D ore lens is interpreted to have formed in the footwall of the A ore lens via replacement. Alteration zones below the B/C and the A ore lens and around the D ore lens are characterized by large mass gains of FeO, MnO, MgO and K 2 O together with large mass gains or losses in silica. The latter alteration zones are around three times larger than the actual ore lenses, and consequently could provide a good exploration guide to ore. Other alteration zones with Na 2 O and CaO depletions occur on a semi-regional scale, but are most intense close to the ores. The proximal part of the footwall complex, which is dominated by synvolcanic felsic intrusions, is only weakly altered, which suggests that the intrusions were emplaced slightly after formation of the massive sulfide lenses. The results of this study can be used to help identify ore horizon and favorable alteration zones in other parts of the Skellefte district and elsewhere. Godkänd; 2005; 20061218 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|The massive {{sulphide}} deposits at Areachap and Kantienpan Cu-Zn Mine are {{hosted by}} a ~ 1600 Ma old volcano sedimentary succession {{known as the}} Areachap Group, {{in the eastern part}} of Namaqua Metamorphic Province, South Africa. The deposits were affected by a complex deformation and metamorphic history and represent examples of upper amphibolite to granulite grade metamorphosed volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) deposits. The host rocks of both ore deposits are peraluminous-gneisses and the dominant sulphide minerals in the ore zone are pyrite, pyrrhotite sphalerite, and chalcopyrite and trace amounts of galena. Other ore related minerals include barite and anhydrite. The metamorphic minerals in the alteration zones at the Areachap and Kantienpan VHMS deposits are characterized by the presence of plagioclase, almandine and pyrope, enstatite and clinoenstatite, cummingtonite and gedrite, cordierite, sillimanite, and retrograde chlorite and chamosite. <b>Lithogeochemical</b> <b>methods</b> are widely used in exploration geochemistry to identify the primary alteration zones related to VHMS mineralization, as these zones are often exposed, while the massive sulphide ore body itself may be concealed. Especially in areas that were not affected by high grade metamorphism and intensive deformation. Some of these methods include the variation in the relative abundance of major element concentrations throughout the rock successions, mineral chemistry of silicates and spinel minerals near the ore zone, and normative compositions of the rock successions. However, the application of these methods is limited by complex geology in regional metamorphic terranes, such as the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. Therefore, in addition, three of the more advanced lithogeochemical approaches, known as the Isocon method, the Box Plot and Pearce Elemental Ratios, are combined here and adapted for application in such regions. Based on the mineral chemistry, it is evident that plagioclase is more Ca-rich adjacent to the ore zone, pyroxene has the highest relative Mg* ratio (Mg* ratio = 100 x cationic ratio of Mg / (Mg + Fe + Ca)), the almandine and pyrope components of garnet are high and the spessartine and grossular components are low. In addition, the Mg-rich variety of mica (phlogopite) is more common near the ore zone and the peraluminous nature of the footwall zone is revealed by the presence of gahnite. Cordierite and retrograde chlorites show the highest Mg#’s (Mg# = Mg/ (Mg + Fe)) in the ore zone. In addition to the above, Pearce Element Ratio analyses of cordierite, pyroxene and garnet may be used to define proximity to sulphide mineralization. Geochemically, the ore zone and alteration zones at Areachap and Kantienpan VHMS ore deposits display a high peraluminous ratio (Al 2 O 3 / (Na 2 O+K 2 O+CaO)) confirming the peraluminous nature of these zones as indicated by the mineral chemistry discussed above. The intervals identified in sampled borehole core with low CaO and Na 2 O and with high MgO and K 2 O contents represent the alteration zone in the original footwall rocks of the deposit. Isocon studies have shown that the alteration zones at the Areachap and Kantienpan deposits are enriched in Mg, Fe (total), S, Zn, Si, Co and F and depleted in Na, Ca, Sr, Ni, V and La. Elements that behaved relatively immobile include Zr, Ti, P, Mn, Al, Y, and U. The box plot, alteration index versus the chlorite-carbonate-pyrite index, was originally proposed to illustrate the combined effects of hydrothermal and diagenetic alteration and is based on characteristic primary mineral reactions in regions not affected by regional metamorphism. It is demonstrated here that these primary mineral reactions are preserved in a unique set of metamorphic minerals, and that the box plot can be modified for high-grade metamorphic rock types. When samples with very high Mg contents (MgO>>K 2 O, AI> 90 % and CCPI> 98 %) are plotted in the box plot they may be classified as representative of anomalous areas that are highly prospective. Samples with high Mg contents (MgO>K 2 O, AI> 64 % and CCPI> 93 %) may be considered representative of areas that may be classified as of moderate priority in an exploration programme. The findings of the mineral chemical and geochemical investigations of the footwall alteration at the Kantienpan, Areachap and Prieska Cu-Zn ore bodies are used to define various statistical factors. The applicability of these factors in lithogeochemical exploration is demonstrated by calculating the respective factor scores for a regional lithogeochemical data set. It is demonstrated how these factors could be used to identify samples collected from localities that are highly prospective for the discovery of concealed VHMS style mineralization. Based on the statistical analyses of the regional data set, the altered rocks may be distinguished from the metapelitic rocks by their high scores for the alteration factor and low scores for the peraluminous factor. The peraluminous rocks may be separated from the hornblende-gneisses by their high scores for the peraluminous factor, and from the amphibolites by their very low ortho-amphibolite factor scores and high peraluminous factor scores. The variation, of trace elements in the surface calcrete layer that conceals the mineralization in the studied areas, displays the geochemical signature of mineralization, but the concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb are much lower at and near surface and increase down depth within the profiles. The absolute concentrations and peak to background ratios of the elements of interest at the surface therefore depend on the thickness of the underlying calcrete layer in the area. Two methods, a total analysis (x-ray fluorescence, XRF) and partial extraction (NH 4 EDTA solution), were applied in to evaluate results, which would be successful and commercially viable in a general exploration programme, using regolith samples. The results of the two methods above were then compared to another patented partial extraction method (mobile metal ion, MMI) on a data set previously reported on by Rossouw (2003). At Kantienpan, where the sand cover is very shallow to absent, dispersion appears to be more related to the secondary redistributions of gossaniferous clasts, than to dispersion of mobile metal ions on the surface of sand particles. The XRF method shows a wider dispersion halo here than methods based on partial extraction. Whereas, at Areachap, where a relatively thick sand (approximately one metre) covers the calcrete layer, partial extraction (based on a NH 4 EDTA solution extraction) results in a larger, recognizable, dispersion halo than that detected by XRF. The MMI results show a larger span for Zn, followed by NH 4 EDTA and finally XRF. For Cu, the NH 4 EDTA method exhibits the largest span followed by XRF and then MMI. The anomalous Cu, Zn and Pb contents extracted by partial extraction methods from the wind blown sand deposits indicate that these elements were derived from the ore minerals related to the massive sulphide deposits. However, Mn and Fe contents analysed by XRF also show high values that could not be only related to derivation from massive sulphide ores. Some of the high concentrations of these elements in the sand cover is ascribed to the weathering of other iron-rich rock forming minerals. Thesis (PhD (Geology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
