5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael {{and demand}} that he perform a series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> him. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Song (960–1276) were a Chinese dynasty. To their north {{were the}} Jurchens, a {{confederation}} of semi-agrarian tribes from Manchuria in northeast Asia. While the Song and Jurchen {{had once been}} military allies, the Jurchen tribes, unified {{under the rule of}} Wanyan Aguda, plotted a revolt in 1114 to end their vassalage under the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. Aguda established the Jin dynasty in 1115 and adopted the title of emperor. The Jin negotiated a joint attack with the Song against the Khitans. They planned the attack for 1121 and then rescheduled to 1122. In 1122, the Jurchens captured the Liao Supreme and Western Capitals. The Song tried yet failed to capture the Liao Southern Capital of Yan (modern Beijing), which fell later that year to the Jin. The military weakness of the Song gave the Jin more diplomatic <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> them. Negotiations between the Song and Jin produced a treaty in 1123, but bilateral relations deteriorated because of territorial disputes over the Sixteen Prefectures. In 1125, the Jurchens invaded the Song.|$|E
5|$|When {{the gunmen}} {{stop at a}} restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and {{exchange}} gunfire. One suspect is killed while the other manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates {{a story about the}} men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.|$|E

25|$|International {{politics}} play {{an important}} role in IMF decision making. The clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF finances.

25|$|The {{corporate}} campaign {{was developed to}} augment, and sometimes supplant, the community campaign.

25|$|The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament briefly gained <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> Labour Party {{policy at}} the {{beginning}} of the decade, but soon went into a long eclipse.

25|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} over the earliest mention of Zubarah in written documents. Qatar's Memorial, a 1986 Arabic history book, alleges that a functional self-governing town existed {{before the arrival}} of the Utub.

However, after Yamasaki and Kato were humiliated in a disastrous attempt to force a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori in 2000, Koizumi became the last remaining credible member of the YKK trio, which gave him <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> the reform-minded wing of the party.|$|E

25|$|DAT was {{available}} {{as early as}} 1987 in Japan and Europe, but device manufacturers delayed introducing the format to the United States {{in the face of}} opposition from the recording industry. The recording industry, fearing that the ability to make perfect, multi-generation copies would spur widespread copyright infringement and lost sales, had two main points of <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> device makers.

The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations. On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices. In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex.|$|E
25|$|Where Michael is concerned, Fiona is {{not entirely}} willing {{to let go of}} their past relationship, which {{continues}} to simmer.

However, she is accused of the British Consulate bombings as the antagonist Anson Fullerton tricks her into confessing to a crime she did not commit. Anson uses this <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> Michael and forces him to do work for himself. To remove this leverage, Fiona eventually surrenders and is arrested by the FBI as Michael watches in vain. In the series finale, she and Michael are living happily and raising Charlie as their son.|$|E

50|$|Alpha's {{leverage}} ratio was around five times. Beta's leverage {{was up to}} 10 times, depending upon {{the quality of its}} asset portfolio. Subsequent SIVs, such as Centauri and Dorada, raised the leverage to around 20 times. Typically banks are leveraged between 25 and 50 times, so most SIVs operated with leverage of approx half that of traditional banks. By 2004, Sedna was offering notes that were <b>leveraged</b> <b>over</b> 100 times that attempted to achieve a spread of 10% or more in the medium term.|$|R
50|$|A major {{initiative}} of the Obama Administration is Power Africa, which aims to bring energy to 20 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. By reaching out to its international partners, whether commercial or public, the US has <b>leveraged</b> <b>over</b> $14 billion in outside commitments after investing only $7 billion USD of its own. To ensure that Power Africa reaches the region's poorest, the initiative engages in a transaction based approach to create systematic change. This includes expanding access to electricity to more than 20,000 additional households which already live without power.|$|R
25|$|Next to the CPC, {{a second}} secret army command center, labeled Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC), {{was set up}} in 1957 on the orders of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR).

However, after Emma hears the whispers of the dagger, she meets with Gold, who reveals {{the truth to}} Emma, about him using a magic potion to turn Excalibur into a conduit, so that when Emma killed all of the Dark Ones, their magic was {{transferred}} into Gold, allowing Gold to reclaim his life as the Dark One, and creating a new Dagger in the process, with a reversed color scheme of a black blade with silver engravings. (Excalibur was still tethered to the Darkness, so when Gold became the Dark One again, the Dagger reappeared.) He adds that he is more powerful than ever before, since he now wields the combined power of every Dark One that ever lived including her. Emma is very cross about this and tells him that she now has <b>leverage</b> <b>over</b> Gold, threatening to tell Belle at any moment the truth about her husband. In exchange for Emma keeping the secret, Gold agrees to help her enter the Underworld to rescue Hook. At the lake, Emma is joined by Gold, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, Robin, and Henry, as they approach the ferry to descend into the Underworld.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model on {{the leverage of}} 8 ̆ 5 nancial intermediaries, where debt are held by risk averse agents and equity by the risk neutral. The paper shows that in an unregulated competitive market, 8 ̆ 5 nancial intermediaries choose to be <b>leveraged</b> <b>over</b> the social best level. This is because the leverage of one intermediary imposes a negative externality upon others by reducing their pro 8 ̆ 5 t margins. The paper thus founds capital adequacy regulation upon the market failure and suggests that this regulation should bind not only commercial banks, but all 8 ̆ 5 nancial intermediaries, including private equities and hedge funds...|$|R
