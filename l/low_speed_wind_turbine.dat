40|$|Growth rate of wind {{velocity}} Abstract. Traditional wind turbines are difficulty {{to work well}} in built-up areas due to wind conditions of low speed, turbulence and frequent changing direction. A long-term wind observation {{work has been done}} to understand the characteristics of urban wind by installing a small weather station on the balcony at top floor of a residential building. Based on the observation results, a new structure for <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> in built-up areas was designed. This structure can be used for either horizontal axis wind turbine or vertical axis wind turbine. Some mesh models were established to simulate the effect through CFD software. In this structure, growth rate of {{wind velocity}} is about 1. 25 times; wind turbulence converts to laminar; and yawing angel of turbine motor shafts needn’t change any more. Prototype testing draws better conclusions: growth rate of wind velocity is more than 1. 4 times. Therefore, traditional wind turbines can work well in built-up areas through this new structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wind {{energy is}} one of the cost {{effective}} renewable energy source. It is generated by horizontal axis and vertical axis wind turbines. Wind speed should be in the range of 5 m/s to 15 m/s for its effective generation. <b>Low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> development is in progress. Many leading research organizations, research labs in universities and wind energy industries around the globe are trying to develop micro or mini wind tunnel for feeding the electricity needs of urban houses. Energy generation from wind involves lot of electrical, mechanical and wind related parameters. Study of these parameters and their effect on electrical output is research topic for many decades. Testing of wind turbine with variation in wind parameters, electrical machines and tower type etc. are the major problems. Research centres of many establishments of leading companies such as suzlon has facilities to do such research work. Academic fraternity finds extremely difficult. One of the options is computer simulation. Wind tunnels of various sizes are available in leading educational organizations and companies. However most to them are of small and medium sizes and are suitable for performing specific tests pertaining to the particular product. This paper focuses on study of various wind tunnel parameters, types of tunnels, wind tunnel size and shape, air delivery, inlet-outlet dimensions and length of wind tunnel. Cooling of air, type of testing which can be performed etc are presented in this paper by keeping the major focus on electrical aspects in setting up wind tunnel...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of wind energy {{installations}} exist on rich wind resource sites.

For these <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> resource areas, <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> technology is required. For this reason, this DTU Wind Energy master project, in cooperation with Ming Yang Wind Power European R&D Centre ApS, looks into {{the design of a}} <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade.

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are {{designed}} to deliver optimal power at rated <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> Site specific designs, therefore are highly desirable. Lift based turbines are more efficient than stall based turbines. Stall regulated turbines require suitable section profiles. However, the three dimensional effects dominated by rotation are not properly understood. The <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blades are highly flexible. Aeroelastic analysis incorporating both structural dynamics and computational fluid dynamics forms {{the basis of this}} study. Of many effects, the blade flexibility plays a crucial role in optimal design. This requires a good understanding of the aeroelastic behavior of turbine rotors. Effect of flexibility on turbine performance is still unexplored. Following the demand for lighter blades, new composite materials and advanced fabrication methods were introduced, resulting in reduced structural damping, a property which until recently was not possible to model and enhance. Therefore it is necessary to accurately construct the computational model of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade. This report describes the structural modeling of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade similar to NAL's 500 kW <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade designed for Indian wind conditions.

40|$|Malaysia {{experiences}} wind {{of strength}} 3 - 4 m/s average annually. Hence the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> already existing {{in the world}} market is not feasible economically to be implemented in Malaysia since it operates in the wind strength of 8 - 15 m/s. Thus {{the aim of the}} research work is to establish a suitable <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> for electricity generation in Malaysia. After nearly 15 years of research work, a <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> based on the average <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of Malaysia has been successfully designed, built and tested. This particular <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is called “Eqwin Turbine”. Eqwin is the short form of Equatorial Wind and thus this particular type of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is not only good for Malaysia but also for all countries in the equatorial regions. Eqwin starts to operate in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of as <b>low</b> as 2. 5 m/s and has been designed to have its maximum rating at 5 m/s wind. The structures have been designed to withstand the Malaysia once in 50 years <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of 23 m/s. The design had been taken into consideration of the easiness of local manufacturing (manpower and technology), availability of material and installation to ensure effectively low production cost. Estimated Eqwin will have a minimum lifetime of 15 years with very nearly maintenance free. The tested prototype was of 3 m diameter capable of producing 0. 5 - 1. 5 kW maximum power in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> ranges from 3 – 5 m/s at a height of 10 m above ground. Currently work is being concentrated at building a 10 m diameter prototype to operate at 30 m height for enhancing wind energy harness. To justify the quantum of Eqwin usage in Malaysia, wind power maps for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak had also been developed. The maps show that Eqwin Turbines could be used for electricity generation in about 60 % of the country, especially good in rural areas of Sabah and Sarawak where power grid is not available.

This paper {{reports on}} the design cost and scaling model of a small scale superconducting <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generator, where the levelized cost of energy (COE) was calculated. The {{proposed}} design of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{is based on the}} vertical axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (VAWT) type that drives the superconducting generator.

Once the design has been accomplished, all the cost of parts and components must be accounted and contributes to the overall cost of generating electrical energy from the superconducting <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generator. The cost elements include the initial capital cost (ICC), balance of station (BOS), operation and maintenance (O&M), levelized replacement cost (LRC) and annual energy production (AEP).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the upper}} latitudes, <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> provide an {{effective}} means to generate wind power.

The Weibull parameters are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood, the mean power densities, the maximum energy carrying <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and the most probable <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> are also calculated and compared over these three cities. Finally, the cumulative <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> distributions over the wet and dry seasons are also analyzed. The {{results show that the}} shape and scale parameters for Kribi, Douala and Limbe are 2. 9 and 2. 8, 3. 9 and 1. 8 and 3. 08 and 2. 58, respectively. The mean power densities through Weibull analysis for Kribi, Douala and Limbe are 33. 7 W/m 2, 8. 0 W/m 2 and 25. 42 W/m 2, respectively. Kribi’s most probable <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and maximum energy carrying <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> was found to be 2. 42 m/s and 3. 35 m/s, 2. 27 m/s and 3. 03 m/s for Limbe and 1. 67 m/s and 2. 0 m/s for Douala, respectively. Analysis of the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and hence power distribution over the wet and dry seasons shows that in the wet season, August is the windiest month for Douala and Limbe while September is the windiest month for Kribi while in the dry season, March is the windiest month for Douala and Limbe while February is the windiest month for Kribi.

Wind data for the 10 meteorological stations in Sabah and Sarawak had been obtained from `Malaysia Meteorological Department', Petaling Jaya, Selangor. Wind data for a period of 5 consecutive years (1998 - 2002) for each meteorological station had been processed, analyzed and used in this research. All the 5 meteorological stations in Sarawak (Kucing, Sri Aman, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri meteorological stations) are situated near the coast line whereas there is none in the vast interior areas of the country. This, in fact caused some hindrance to the process of establishing the wind map of Sarawak itself. To accelerate the process, wind data for Bario, Belaga and Kapit had been established through the wind strength correlations between these places and the existing meteorological stations in Sarawak and Labuan. Sabah on the other hand, although all the 4 existing meteorological stations in the country also situated near the coast line but these locations are seems to be well arranged like a circle encircling the entire country. Hence, the wind data for only a single interior location had been established through wind strength correlation. The said identified location was Tongod and the wind data has been predicted through the wind strength correlation between this location and all the 4 existing meteorological stations in Sabah (Kota Kinabalu, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau meteorological stations) and Labuan. Wind, roughness and obstacle data for each o f t he meteorological and identified w ind strength correlated stations in Sabah and Sarawak had been processed in accordance to the need and requirement of the WAsP Commercial Software. The processed data were then fed into the software in order to establish the wind map for Sabah and Sarawak at the heights of 20 and 50 meters above ground level. Wind data from Mulu meteorological station had been used in validating the accuracy of prediction portrayed the wind map of Sarawak for the height of 20 meters above ground. The outcomes of the validation test were very satisfactory. Three types of wind maps for Sabah and Sarawak had been established i. e. the North East Monsoon Season, the South West Monsoon Season and the Yearly Wind Maps.

The aim {{of this research is}} to further the understanding of conditioning monitoring of <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> through the development of a test rig, leading to a computer simulated model of the drive train. A turbine drive train is subjected to a highly dynamic speed input, and this has {{led to the development of}} a system for driving the test rig with a variable speed input. The driving data is derived from two Supergen <b>Wind</b> Consortium exemplar <b>turbine</b> models at 2 MW and 5 MW. The control and data acquisition for the condition monitoring rig has been developed to incorporate signal conditioning and filtering hardware for signals. This research aims to understand and verify the behaviour of the Durham test rig through characterisation of the torsional behaviour and natural response. Relevance Harsh environmental conditions offshore not only affect the machine and support structure but also acces-sibility for inspection and maintenance. Tavner et al. [1] produced statistical reliability analysis of known <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> failures and demonstrated that the root cause of many failures is centred on the drive train and its subsystems. These results, combined with the high mean time to repair (MTTR) of drive train components, such as the gearbox and generator, due to the offshore location make the drive train a key focus for condition monitoring. The MTTR could be controlled through planning maintenance strategies which would be aided by an effective, reliable and cheap condition monitoring system. The remote nature of offshore sites means that reducing the number of signals to be communicated is of great importance. It has been demonstrated that fault frequencies can be detected in stator current [2], speed signals [3], stator electrical power and torque, and the Durham test rig seeks to utilise these readily available signals to develop and prove diagnostic and monitoring techniques...|$|R
40|$|Objective Tuberculosis {{transmission}} {{in healthcare}} facilities contributes {{significantly to the}} TB epidemic, particularly in high HIV settings. Although improving ventilation may reduce transmission, {{there is a lack}} of evidence to support low-cost practical interventions. We assessed the efficacy of wind-driven roof turbines to achieve recommended ventilation rates, compared to current recommended practices for natural ventilation (opening windows), in primary care clinic rooms in Khayelitsha, South Africa. METHODS: Room ventilation was assessed (CO 2 gas tracer technique) in 4 rooms where roof turbines and air-intake grates were installed, across three scenarios: turbine, grate and window closed, only window open, and only turbine and grate open, with concurrent <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> measurement. 332 measurements were conducted over 24 months. FINDINGS: For all 4 rooms combined, median air changes per hour (ACH) increased with <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> quartiles across all scenarios. Higher median ACH were recorded with open roof turbines and grates, compared to open windows across all <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> quartiles. Ventilation with open turbine and grate exceeded WHO-recommended levels (60 Litres/second/patient) for 95 % or more of measurements in 3 of the 4 rooms; 47 % in the remaining room, where <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> were lower and a smaller diameter turbine was installed. CONCLUSION: High room ventilation rates, meeting recommended thresholds, may be achieved using wind-driven roof turbines and grates, even at <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> Roof <b>turbines</b> and air-intake grates are not easily closed by staff, allowing continued ventilation through colder periods.

This work {{in one of the}} Blade System Design Studies (BSDS) funded through Sandia National Laboratories. The BSDS program was conducted in two phases. In the Part I BSDS, GEC assessed candidate innovations in composite materials, manufacturing processes, and structural configurations. GEC also made recommendations for testing composite coupons, details, assemblies, and blade substructures to be carried out in the Part II study (BSDS-II). The BSDS-II contract period began in May 2003, and testing was initiated in June 2004. The current report summarizes the results from the BSDS-II test program. Composite materials evaluated include carbon fiber in both pre-impregnated and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) forms. Initial thin-coupon static testing included a wide range of parameters, including variation in manufacturer, fiber tow size, fabric architecture, and resin type. A smaller set of these materials and process types was also evaluated in thin-coupon fatigue testing, and in ply-drop and ply-transition panels. The majority of materials used epoxy resin, with vinyl ester (VE) resin also used for selected cases. Late in the project, testing of unidirectional fiberglass was added to provide an updated baseline against which to evaluate the carbon material performance. Numerous unidirectional carbon fabrics were considered for evaluation with VARTM infusion. All but one fabric style considered suffered either from poor infusibility or waviness of fibers combined with poor compaction. The exception was a triaxial carbon-fiberglass fabric produced by SAERTEX. This fabric became the primary choice for infused articles throughout the test program. The generally positive results obtained in this program for the SAERTEX material have led to its being used in innovative prototype blades of 9 -m and 30 -m length, as well as other non-wind related structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} in {{wind energy system}} is growing worldwide to reduce dependency on fossil fuel and to minimize the adverse impact of climate change. Currently, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> technology with gearbox is dominating the world market share. However, {{the problems associated with}} induction generator based <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are reactive power consumption, mechanical stress and poor power quality. Moreover, the gearbox requires regular maintenance as it suffers from faults and malfunctions. Therefore, it is important to adopt technologies that can enhance efficiency, reliability and reduce system cost of wind based power generation system. The performance of a variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> can be enhanced significantly by using a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) without a gearbox. The main features of PMSG based <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are; gearless operation, higher efficiency, enhanced reliability, smaller size, reduced cost and low losses. The main aim of this thesis is to develop improved control strategies for an efficient and reliable grid interface system for a gearless, direct drive variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> This thesis focuses on several aspects of modelling and control of interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous generator based grid connected variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with maximum power extraction (MPE). Both the indirect and direct control strategies are addressed for IPM synchronous generator based variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> The main contributions of this thesis are; (i) development of parameter measurement methods to determine the parameter of an IPM synchronous generator, (ii) development of an improved indirect vector control scheme for the IPM synchronous generator based direct drive variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> incorporating maximum torque per ampere trajectory (MTPA) and maximum power extraction (MPE) algorithm (iii) development of direct torque and flux (DTFC) control scheme for the IPM synchronous generator based direct drive variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> and (iv) development of control and power management strategy for a three level converter based STATCOM with Supercapacitor energy storage to enhance the performance of the proposed wind energy conversion system under various disturbances...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis {{the theory}} and {{practical}} use of modal analysis is explained, giving {{an introduction to the}} possibilities of modal analysis. The master thesis starts with a look at wind power and the design of a modern <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> Two models, one for constant <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and one for variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> are presented. An example shows how modal analysis can be utilized to evaluate a network's dynamic stability. Simulations are performed on a two-area network where different wind power models are tested and compared. A two-mass model is used to model a constant <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> The model consists of an asynchronous generator, a turbine, and a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> shaft with a tensional stiffness. The model representing the variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is based on a DFIG model included in the simulation software. The two-area network consists of two areas connected together through a long line between Bus 5 and Bus 6. Area 1 has two production sources, one placed in Bus 1 and one placed in Bus 2. The second area represents a large network modelled as a very large synchronous generator with a high inertia. The calculations have showed how modal analysis can be used to evaluate a system by using linearized differential equations and how the systems robustness against small disturbances can be altered by changing the systems parameters. Simulations have verified that a two-mass model must be used when modelling a constant <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> The inertia of the turbine will greatly influence the model's behaviour and must therefore be included in the model. Eigenvalues analysis performed during different <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> have documented that wind power will not become less stable towards small disturbances when operated at <b>low</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> conditions. </p...|$|R

The new grid code proposes that the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> should remain connected to the grid during voltage disturbances. Three phase voltage sags and faults cause reduction in voltage at the point of interconnection to the grid when fixed <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> connected to squirrel cage induction generators are employed resulting in disconnection of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> from the grid.

The control architecture is equipped with an event-based supervisor for the supervision level and fuzzy proportional integral or discrete adaptive linear quadratic as proposed controllers for the execution level.

40|$|Owing to the {{rotational}} {{sampling of}} turbulence, wind shear and tower shadow effects grid connected variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{could lead to}} the power fluctuations which may produce flicker during continuous operation. A model of an megawatt (MW) -level variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with a doubly fed induction generator is presented to investigate the flicker mitigation. Taking advantage of the large inertia of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rotor, a generator torque control (GTC) strategy is proposed, so that the power oscillation is stored as the kinetic energy of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rotor, thus the flicker emission could be reduced. The GTC scheme is proposed and designed according to the generator rotational speed. The simulations are performed on the national renewable energy laboratory 1. 5 MW upwind reference <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> model. Simulation results show that damping the generator active power by GTC is an effective means for flicker mitigation of variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> during continuous operation. keywords: asynchronous generators;oscillations;power generation control;torque control;wind power plants;wind turbines;GTC strategy;continuous operation;doubly fed induction generator;flicker emission;flicker mitigation strategy;generator active power;generator torque control;kinetic energy;megawatt-level variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> turbine;power oscillation;tower shadow effects grid connected variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> turbines;turbulence;upwind reference <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> model;variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> turbines;wind shear;wind <b>turbine</b> roto...|$|R
