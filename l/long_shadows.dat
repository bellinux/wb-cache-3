5000|$|In Justice League Unlimited, the {{character}} <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> is based directly on Apache Chief and is voiced by Gregg Rainwater. Here he {{is a member}} of the Ultimen (the group itself a reference to the Super Friends). <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> has the ability to increase his size, increasing his strength (he also demonstrates superhuman strength, fighting lava men hand-to-hand even before growing). He also gains enhanced hearing. <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> comes off as the most innocent and selfless member of the Ultimen, a quality which sets him apart from his somewhat greedy teammates and catches the eye of Wonder Woman. He is also the only member of the Ultimen to express interest in joining the Justice League, the others being more concerned with the material rewards of their current arrangement. When the team discovers that they are clones and that their cellular structure is breaking down, <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> remains the voice of reason as the others become increasingly unstable, Wind Dragon in particular. When they are unable to find a cure, his teammates begin to destroy the building that serves as their headquarters in order to find Amanda Waller. <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> assists in evacuating the civilians from the building, then tries to reason with Wind Dragon when he decides to destroy the Justice League. After all but Wind Dragon are defeated, <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> convinces him to stop fighting, citing Wind Dragon's former appreciation of the Justice League as heroes. The Ultimen are incarcerated by Project Cadmus, but <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> is allowed to remain with the Justice League (thanks to the efforts of Wonder Woman and Batman) for the remainder of his clone lifespan. <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> dies sometime in between this episode and [...] "Panic in the Sky". Numerous clones of <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> and the Ultimen appear in [...] "Panic in the Sky" [...] when Galatea and the Ultimen army attack the Watchtower. Some of the <b>Long</b> <b>Shadow</b> clones are defeated by Atom Smasher.|$|R

25|$|The cricket {{ground was}} a winsomely green oval {{surrounded}} by grass banks and large leafy trees. Because of the trees, playing hours were set between nine-thirty and four-thirty, otherwise <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> overcast the wicket. Until nearly {{nine in the}} morning the ground would be shrouded in mist; then it suddenly dispersed and the arena was bathed in sunlight like the stage of an amphitheatre.|$|E
25|$|In {{their bright}} whites, the figures clearly {{stand out from}} the rest of the image. The light is {{characteristic}} of the early evening of a summer day in the Mediterranean. The already low sun appears from the direction of the viewer on the two sides to seeing women whose <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical Valenciano for Luminismo, one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaquín Sorolla.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{extended}} version can be heard on the Thriller 25 album, released in 2008. Price appeared as Sir Despard Murgatroyd in a 1982 television production of Gilbert & Sullivan's Ruddigore (with Keith Michell as Robin Oakapple). In 1983, Price played the Sinister Man in the British spoof horror film Bloodbath at the House of Death. He appeared in House of the <b>Long</b> <b>Shadows,</b> which teamed him with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine. Although Price had worked {{with each of the}} actors at least once in previous decades, {{this was the first time}} all had teamed up. One of his last major roles, and one of his favorites, was as the voice of Professor Ratigan in Walt Disney Pictures' The Great Mouse Detective in 1986.|$|E

He appoints Half Moon, then returns to the present day, where he appoints Crag Where Eagles Nest as the Stoneteller of modern times to resolve a crisis due to the current Stoneteller dying of old age without a successor.|$|E
500|$|The third series, Warriors: Power of Three, was {{released}} from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: The Sight (April 24, 2007), Dark River (December 26, 2007), Outcast (April 22, 2008), Eclipse (September 2, 2008), <b>Long</b> <b>Shadows</b> (November 25, 2008), and Sunrise (April 21, 2009).

500|$|In the painting, a black magpie {{is perched}} on a gate in a wattle fence as {{sunlight}} falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus. Michael Howard of Manchester Metropolitan University called the painting [...] "an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites {{of the sky and}} landscape". Curator Lynn Orr, then of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere: ...|$|E
500|$|Others {{argued that}} legal reform of {{skyscraper}} construction {{was needed for}} {{public health and safety}} reasons, an area in which U.S. law was normally more supportive of state intervention. The risk of fire was one concern; while skyscrapers might be relatively fireproof, their height made conventional fire-fighting difficult. Architect Charles Bragdon considered a large scale, devastating high-rise fire to be inevitable if regulation was not forthcoming. The Baltimore fire of 1904 was widely cited as an example of this risk and, although Baltimore had few high rise buildings, city lawyers argued that the taller buildings had caused the flames to spread through the city during the blaze. Baltimore subsequently passed a law in 1904, banning buildings higher than [...] Other campaigners argued that skyscrapers were compromising access to light and air, noting that when tall buildings rose straight up from the sidewalk, they cast <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> across the street, preventing healthy sunlight from reaching smaller buildings below.|$|E
500|$|The team's {{goal was}} to create the [...] "best, most {{realistic}} civilian flight simulator", which would provide an immersive world for the player. Radio communications between ATCs, AI planes and the player occur in real-time: a [...] "sophisticated audio splicing system" [...] gathers pre-recorded voice fragments into contextually appropriate sentences. The team recorded the engine noise {{of each of the}} game's planes, and they designed cockpits more interactive than those in Flight Unlimited. Roughly 300 times more terrain area was included in Flight Unlimited II than in its predecessor. To generate the terrain, the team combined digital elevation maps with satellite imagery rendered at four square meters per pixel. The images were taken at 9:30am, because the <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> provided an illusion of depth. 3D models were used for all buildings taller than nine stories. Because of the terrain detail, the game was the first to allow players to follow VFR. Initially, the team planned to include only VFR flight, but they later enabled IFR to [...] "ease navigation". The team hoped to add more terrain and planes and a multiplayer feature after the game's release.|$|E

500|$|Erika Ramirez and Andrew Hampp of Billboard {{felt that}} the song mixed [...] "uncanny" [...] styles and noted that as the chorus starts, {{listeners}} [...] "can see Beyonce singing this from the stage surrounded by smoke machines." [...] USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in [...] "Jealous" [...] along with [...] "Haunted", the singer [...] "embodies success and privilege on the surface, {{but there is a}} sense that her contentment is fragile". Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci observed that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. Writing for Clash magazine, Mike Diver praised Beyoncé's vocal performance noting, [...] "When Beyoncé truly unleashes her vocals on ballad-tempo moments... 'Jealous', she immediately casts <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> over singers who might have tried to shift her from the top table of pop". Mike Wass of Idolator considered [...] "Jealous" [...] to be an update of the singer's [...] "If I Were a Boy", sung by a grown woman. He went on to praise the [...] "frank, honest and vulnerable" [...] characteristics the singer decided to showcase in the song, opposed to her other material where she was reluctant to discuss about them. Wass finished his review by noting that [...] "Jealous" [...] would be a [...] "dark horse for a radio single down the line". Brittany Spanos of The Village Voice described the song as a [...] "grown up version" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] with lyrics about [...] "persistent mistrust". Latifah Muhammad of BET deemed the song a [...] "distant cousin" [...] to [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and stated that its turning point comes during several lines of the bridge.|$|E

The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer; Cohan's comment on Cagney’s performance was, [...] "My God, what an act to follow!"

2500|$|The Second Boer War cast <b>long</b> <b>shadows</b> {{over the}} history of the South African region. The {{predominantly}} agrarian society of the former Boer republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the scorched earth policy of Roberts and Kitchener. The devastation of both Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region. Many exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon the farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning and salting of the fields {{in the course of the}} scorched earth policy.

2500|$|Warriors: Power of Three is {{the third}} arc in the Warriors {{juvenile}} fantasy novel series about anthropomorphic feral cats. The arc comprises six novels which were published from 2007 to 2009: The Sight, Dark River, Outcast, Eclipse, <b>Long</b> <b>Shadows,</b> and Sunrise. The novels are published by HarperCollins under the pseudonym Erin Hunter, which refers to authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui Sutherland and plot developer/editor Victoria Holmes. Power of Three details the experiences of protagonist of the first series Firestar's three grandchildren, initially known as Jaykit, Hollykit, and Lionkit, whom a prophecy foretells will have [...] "the power of the stars in their paws". The arc's major themes deal with forbidden love, the concept of nature versus nurture, and characters being a mix of good and bad. Though the novels have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List and have been nominated for several awards, none of the novels in Warriors: Power of Three have won a significant literary award.|$|E
2500|$|Margit lived a happy {{childhood}} {{until the}} age of eight, when she fell victim to rape. This was the first of three and perhaps the mildest one. She was an adventurous tomboy, who was pleased to do long rambles far away from home. She often took the family dog the long walks, but unfortunately it never accompanied her the times she fell victim to violences. The second rape occurred when she was ten years old and was exceptionally brutal. The rapists used the handle of an axe during the rape, thus causing lifelong injury to her. In other words, damaged her urethra, and after this she has to [...] "trot to a water closet" [...] every half an hour. The rape was performed by three (to her) unknown men in the ages 40 – 60 years old. Margit hid this terrible thing from everyone, including her own mother, until in the age of 60 when she took a close friend into confidence. Sandemo has dealt with these events in the 38th volume of the novel series Sagan om Isfolket, Små men kastar långa skuggor (in English: Small Men Throw <b>Long</b> <b>Shadows).</b> This time from a character's point of view. In October 2004, she stated in her interview given to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she killed her third rapist. He was a wandering pedlar, to whom she fell victim to at the age of twelve. [...] In her own words, she killed this man by throwing a big rock at his head and then lugged the dead body down a hill and put and hid it in a ditch. The third rape revived both previous rapes and she flew into a fit of rage.|$|E
