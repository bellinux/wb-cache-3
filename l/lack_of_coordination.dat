5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, {{investigators}} from a House of Representatives committeeconcerned about the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> between civil and military air traffic controllersimposed a 60-day deadline on the CAB and the Air Force to establish new control procedures. The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E
50|$|However, CARP {{experienced}} slow implementation due to: {{the land}} evaluation {{processes of the}} time, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> guidelines for landowner compensation, troubles with landowner-tenant negotiations, and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> institutional <b>coordination</b> between agrarian administrative agencies.|$|R
50|$|Linda Down is an American woman {{born with}} {{cerebral}} palsy. She completed the 26.1 mile 1982 and 1984 New York City Marathon on crutches, because <b>of</b> her <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>coordination</b> {{as well as}} muscle spasticity.|$|R
50|$|Measurement of {{the effect}} of these {{measures}} is also difficult due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> data and <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> efforts between policy-makers and implementing partners.|$|R
5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, {{and most of these}} aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E
30|$|Minimal hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) can be coupled with poor driving skills {{and a higher}} risk of motor car accidents due to poor attention and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> visuomotor <b>coordination</b> [6, 7]. Poor psychometric performance is associated with driving difficulties [8].|$|R
5|$|The CAB {{issued the}} {{following}} Probable Cause statement:The Board determines the probable {{cause of this}} accident was the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> command <b>coordination</b> and decision, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> judgment, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of the equipment resulting in loss of power in three engines creating an emergency situation which the crew could not handle.|$|R
50|$|THC acetate ester was {{investigated}} {{as a possible}} non-lethal incapacitating agent {{as part of the}} Edgewood Arsenal experiments at some point between 1949 and 1975. It was noted to have about twice the capacity to produce ataxia (<b>lack</b> <b>of</b> voluntary <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> muscle movements) as did THC when administered to dogs.|$|R
5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon, some IJN anti-aircraft units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the anti-aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the anti-aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was of limited effectiveness due to several factors, including preemptive {{action by the}} Ustaše militia and Italian delays. The area of operations straddled the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation within the NDH, which led to mutual suspicion and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination.</b> Both insurgent factions avoided fighting the Axis and NDH forces, instead focusing on fighting each other. After Operation Trio, the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, his Supreme Headquarters and the Partisan main force, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades, withdrew from their base of operations around Foča. After briefly reorganising around Zelengora mountain south-east of Foča, they moved their operations to western Bosnia {{for the remainder of}} 1942.|$|E
25|$|During {{the end of}} 1967, seven RLAF T-28s flew {{support for}} Royalist troops engaged in the Battle of Nam Bac; unfortunately, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> air-ground <b>coordination</b> {{rendered}} the air strikes ineffective. RLAF logistical support of ground troops via helicopter also proved inadequate.|$|R
5|$|The {{region that}} is now Belarus was first settled by Baltic tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area {{was taken over by}} Slavic tribes. The {{takeover}} was partially due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> military <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.|$|R
50|$|Persons with HDLS {{can suffer}} from tremors, {{decreased}} body movement, unsteadiness (Parkinsonism, muscles {{on one side}} of the body in constant contraction (spastic hemiparesis), impairment in motor and sensory function in the lower extremities (paraparesis), paralysis resulting in partial or total loss of all extremities and torso (tetraparesis), and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> voluntary <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> muscle movements (ataxia).|$|R
5|$|While the Japanese {{were able}} to launch 108 {{aircraft}} in just seven minutes, it took Enterprise and Hornet over an hour to launch 117. Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the enemy {{as soon as possible}} was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Geralda was {{the second}} cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda {{produced}} wind gusts as strong as , which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231people and caused over $10million in damage (1994USD). Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCFD {{verification}} {{and validation}} (V&V) are fundamental activities of credibility analysis for aerodynamic simulations. Through these activities, {{a large number}} of data resources will be generated. How to efficiently manage and utilize these treasures is the key problem for benchmark database. In this paper an operable design of open benchmark database is studied and proposed with emphasis on administration, availability, data reliably, unified data standards and open system architecture. The purpose is to provide a paradigm of aerodynamic open benchmark database for CFD V&V, and to overcome some universal obstacles in current aerodynamic database such as <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> continuity and necessary communication. Besides, some recent efforts of credibility analysis for aerodynamic simulations in China are briefly introduced...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the peasants' arsenals, Egypt's military possessed modern arms and artillery. The use of cannons on open battlefields in particular inflicted heavy losses on the rebels.

5|$|On October27, the Yemen {{government}} requested {{assistance from}} the international community, unable to provide disaster assessments or cope with the rebuilding. The storm affected areas of Yemen that already had poor infrastructure and lack of food, and were generally under a state of political unrest, which made recovery difficult. In some areas, relief distribution was duplicated due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> while some areas did not receive help. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs coordinated the relief efforts, {{in conjunction with the}} governors of the most affected areas. The government focused on streamlining disaster activities and toward future mitigation. However, there was no coordinated disaster plan as of September 2009, and the scale of the disaster proved too great for ministries to handle. The Ministry of Public Works helped reopen roads, which allowed for the transport of relief goods, and the damaged Sayun Airport was repaired to withstand future floods. By December 2008, most roads, power systems, hospitals, and communication services were restored. The government also enacted the Fund for Hadramout and Al-Mahara Reconstruction, which failed to promptly distribute aid assistance.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordination.</b> The type {{and degree of}} symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor {{has been shown to}} result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
50|$|The {{county and}} region are {{struggling}} economically. The reasons include: a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> inter-municipal <b>coordination</b> and cooperation, a changing employment base and {{a dearth of}} jobs paying a living wage, out-migration of young people, an aging population, the need for workforce development, and an inequitable local tax structure.|$|R
