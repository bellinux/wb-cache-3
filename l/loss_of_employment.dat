5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the criminal penalties, the use <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> contracts, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> government <b>employment,</b> monetary penalties, non-disclosure agreements, forfeiture of property, injunctions, revocation of passports, and prior restraint are used to deter such speech.|$|R
30|$|Figure 5 {{shows the}} {{dramatic}} dynamics of sectoral structural change and their implications for VET. The declining {{number of employees}} in the production industries and the corresponding decrease in apprenticeships for skilled workers {{would not be a}} problem for VET if <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and training places were replaced by the service sector. But this is not the case. Figure  5 shows that the declining number of employees in industry coincides with an even larger reduction of apprentices. In addition, an expansion <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the service sector corresponds with a clearly lower increase in apprentices.|$|R
30|$|Coming to the {{socio-economic}} {{implications of}} these import restraint scenarios, we note that Indonesia would see income losses among migrant palm oil workers and, of course, among the owners of palm oil plantations. However, the economic dynamics of an expanding sector has also been linked by other authors to land ownership conflicts and other social problems. We might expect that these tensions in social relations and land ownership issues in rural communities would be moderated if their key economic stimulus is weakened. The downside socio-economic effects of a decrease in oil palm production are <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> but these {{are unlikely to be}} serious for the resident rural poor population (in contrast to migrant workers).|$|R
5|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of people {{employed}} in the motor vehicle assembly industry in Ohio was reported to be around 31,000, down from about 40,000 throughout the 1990s, while in the motor vehicle parts production industry in Ohio, in December 1997, employment stood at approximately 122,000 employees; however, that number dropped by about 26% to 90,000 employees by 2004. Despite the growth facts above, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> is more likely to directly affect Ohio's economy. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information estimates that there will be 3,300 less assembly employees and 2,400 less parts manufacturing employees in 2012 than 2002. Major firms operating in the state include Ford, Honda, and General Motors. Some major motor vehicle assembly production plants in the state include the Toledo Complex, Lordstown Assembly, Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant, Ohio Assembly, and Toledo North Assembly. France-based Faurecia Group operates a division in Toledo.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
5000|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women {{introduces}} [...] "maternity {{leave with}} pay or with comparable social benefits without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> former <b>employment,</b> seniority or social allowances".

5|$|In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, {{replaced}} in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As {{a direct result}} <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> mill <b>employment,</b> the number <b>of</b> people living in Homestead dwindled. By {{the time of the}} 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.|$|R
30|$|That the pome {{industry}} adjusts {{better to}} the shocks is again {{seen in the}} labor markets. Despite the smaller <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pre-harvest <b>employment</b> in the pome industry compared to the prunus industry in percentage terms, the pome industry hires more post-harvest labor {{in response to the}} shocks. This is because the output decrease is smaller for the pome industry than the prunus industry.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|However, {{they remain}} {{protected}} from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> {{the decline of the}} middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.|$|E
25|$|An ex-employee {{could not}} recover damages for breach of {{contract}} in respect of injured feelings and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> prospects arising from the harsh and humiliating manner of the dismissal or for any loss sustained because the fact of dismissal itself might {{make it more difficult}} to obtain alternative employment.|$|E
30|$|A topical example are {{the effects}} which highly {{innovative}} {{industries such as}} consumer electronics have on traditional manufacturing industries particularly in highly developed countries like the U.S. Attracted by the innovations, consumers increasingly spend on smart phones, say, while expenditures on, e.g.,, household supplies, linen, upholstery grow much less, if at all. The effects of the innovation induced substitution are completely mediated by the price mechanism and result in a redistribution of income increases, if not of absolute income. In this particular case, it also amounts to an international redistribution of income increments often associated with “globalization”. Since the highly innovative consumer electronics industry has substantial parts of its value chain located in Asia, it contributes to new employment opportunities and rising income there. In contrast, traditional industries in the U.S. suffer from the substitution competition which causes <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and contributes to stagnating labor income here.|$|R
5000|$|Article 11 {{outlines}} {{the right to}} work for women as [...] "an unalienable right of all human beings."

[...] Dismissal {{on the grounds of}} maternity, pregnancy or status of marriage shall be prohibited with sanction.|$|R
25|$|Some IMF {{policies}} may be anti-developmental; {{the report}} said that deflationary effects of IMF programmes quickly led to <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> output and <b>employment</b> in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high.

25|$|Despite {{effective}} treatment and education efforts, leprosy stigma {{continues to be}} problematic in endemic developing countries. Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished or marginalized populations where social stigma {{is likely to be}} compounded by other social inequities.

40|$|The problem <b>of</b> {{unrecorded}} <b>employment</b> {{can cause}} serious {{results on the}} socio-economic structure and public finance of a country. This problem has reached to an unavoidable level in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). According to the study, the amount of unrecorded workers for the year of 2000 has been found as 21, 000. The estimated economic <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> this <b>employment</b> approximately constitutes 6, 4 % of GNP, 14 % of public revenues, 75 % of public deficit and 80 % of public investments.

25|$|The men {{who worked}} at the mine during the 19th century {{travelled}} from a wide area, and many stayed each week in the lodging shops (bunkhouses) built at the mine. In time the company built dozens of houses in Glenridding and Glencoyne. Mining work was carried out by groups of men who took contracts to do specific jobs, and were paid by their results. Those who worked transporting ore out of the mine or processing the ore were paid at weekly rates. The closure of the mine resulted in a major <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the area.|$|E
25|$|Food {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic. In transitory food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time. At the food production level, natural disasters and drought result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food. Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.|$|E
30|$|The lack <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{security}} {{is based on}} the fact that there are no job openings in sectors other than the construction industry and that the reconstruction of the city center will need still more time. Therefore there are no urban facilities that could be sources <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the new settlements. Alexander (2012) underlined how the damage to infrastructure and the reduction in services available resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> productive <b>employment</b> in L’Aquila. Prior to the earthquake Universitá degli Studi dell’Aquila was the main employer in the city. Following the earthquake conditions became difficult due to the large amount of damage, with some important buildings destroyed. The suspension of enrollment fees also made it difficult for the university to continue to function, and enrollments fell by 6  % over the first three semesters after the earthquake (Alexander 2012).|$|R

New technologies used by the IRS, such as e-filing, are simplifying the process and already threatening a portion of this industry as goals set by Congress call for at least 80% of federal returns to be submitted electronically by 2007. According to IRS testimony from 2004, 45% of revenue agents and officers would become eligible for retirement in the following 5 years and there is concern about the loss of their work force as their hiring efforts struggle to keep pace with attrition. In addition, the IRS would not go completely out of commission until 3 years after the FairTax was enacted, providing employees time to find other employment. Proponents claim the projected 10.5% growth in the economy {{during the first year of}} the FairTax would provide plenty of new jobs to these workers that are typically well educated and well equipped with transferable skills (see creative destruction).|$|E
25|$|However loans became {{difficult}} to negotiate due to money market issues, {{and so the}} budget for Operation Phoenix was cut back to £6.8 million.

Works on the Gippsland electrification was to be completed to Warragul station by 1953, but due to the funding cuts the time line was revised to 1954. 500 of the precut houses were cancelled, the Victorian contribution to joint carriage stock for use on The Overland was cut to 6 sitting cars, and work at Newport Workshops building locomotives, carriages and livestock trucks was suspended. Outside rolling stock contractors were also told to slow down, and to defer claims for progress payments until the 1953-54 financial year.|$|E

Due to shame and embarrassment, they may avoid school or work, or repeatedly change jobs and move to another town. Significant developments may occur such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> divorce, becoming housebound, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide attempts. According to some reports, 74% of persons with ORS avoid social situations, 47% avoid work, academic or other important activities, 40% had been housebound for at least 1 week because of ORS, and 31.6% had experienced psychiatric hospitalization.
