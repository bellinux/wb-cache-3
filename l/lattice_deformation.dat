As Si/Fe flux ratio during the MBE growth became smaller than Si/Fe = 2. 0, the lattice constants deviated from those of β-FeSi 2 single crystal, which indicated an enhanced <b>lattice</b> <b>deformation</b> at the lower Si/Fe ratio.

In many cases, the metastable phases are employed as precursors for controlled formation of nanocomposites. This contribution shows how the microstructure of crystalline metastable phases {{and the formation of}} nanocomposites can be concluded from X-ray diffraction experiments by taking advantage of the high sensitivity of X-ray diffraction to macroscopic and microscopic <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> and to the dependence of the <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> on the crystallographic direction. The <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> were determined from the positions and from the widths of the diffraction lines, the dependence of the <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> on the crystallographic direction from the anisotropy of the line shift and the line broadening. As an example of the metastable system, the supersaturated solid solution of titanium nitride and aluminium nitride was investigated, which was prepared in the form of thin films by using cathodic arc evaporation of titanium and aluminium in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Within the perturbative theory up to second order we show that corrections of the conductivity due to the deformations cancel each other exactly. We argue that these corrections vanish to any order in perturbative expansion. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} in anharmonic {{one-dimensional}} crystal lattices pairing of electrons or holes in a localized bisolectron state is possible due to coupling between the charges and the <b>lattice</b> <b>deformation</b> that can overcompensate the Coulomb repulsion. Such localized soliton-like states appear as traveling ground bound singlet states of two extra electrons in the potential well created by the local <b>lattice</b> <b>deformation.</b> We also find the first excited localized state of two electrons in a soliton-like <b>lattice</b> <b>deformation</b> potential well given by a triplet state of two electrons. The results of the analytical study of interacting electrons in a lattice with cubic anharmonicity are compared with the numerical simulations of two electrons in an anharmonic lattice taking into account of the (local) Hubbard electron-electron repulsion. We qualitative agreement between both approaches for a broad interval of parameter values. For illustration we give expressions for the bisolectron binding energy with parameter values that are typical for biological macromolecules.

40|$|In-plane {{stacking}} {{disorder is}} not only characterised by the discontinuous transitions through line-defects presented in the previous chapter, but also by continuous transitions through <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations.</b> We introduce an interplanar bond order criterion to distinguish AB and AC type transitions between two consecutive hexagonal layers. Many of these {{are found to be}} Shockley partial screw dislocations, with a characteristic deformation that is spread across two consecutive layers. How the deformation is spread between the layers varies from case to case, which decreases positional order even more strongly than the continuous transitions presented in the previous chapter. These deformations can be traced until far away from the dislocation, both in layers above and below. The relative deformation between two consecutive hexagonal layers does have a well defined width. The deformed layers act as templates for the consecutive layers, which are deformed as well. The transitions between lateral position therefore take place even far away from the dislocation core, but the transition between AB and AC stacking does not. The full island boundary usually consists of a complex combination of both discontinuous and continuous transitions. Furthermore, we show that the regions, in which the stacking changes, contain a much higher concentration of vacancies. These vacancies cause tiny <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> themselves due to the osmotic pressure imbalance caused by the missing particle, pointing towards a mechanism for the stabilisation of <b>lattice</b> <b>deformations</b> through vacancies...|$|R

Because of the bidimensional shrinkage along the latter two axes, volumetric contraction occurred below 30 K. The λ_ 2 -axis coincides with the crystallographic b-axis. The intersection angle between the λ_ 1 -axis and the crystallographic c-axis was ～ 78. 8 ° at 11 K, and it steadily decreased to ～ 20. 1 ° with in-creasing temperature up to 178 K.
