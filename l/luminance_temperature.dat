The system is designed to handle data from many different formats (vector, raster, tabular) and many different sources (models, radar images, ground truth surveys, optical images). All the data are referenced to a single georeference plane, and average or typical values for parameters defined within a polygonal region are stored in a tabular file, called an info file. The info file format allows tracking of data in time, maintenance of links between component data sets and the georeference image, conversion of pixel values to `actual' values (e. g., radar cross-section, <b>luminance,</b> <b>temperature),</b> graph plotting, data manipulation, generation of training vectors for classification algorithms, and comparison between actual measurements and model predictions (with ground truth data as input) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Global warming {{has been}} {{an issue that is}} gaining more {{attention}} in recent years, and part of the contribution is the urban heat island effect. In recent years the technology of remote sensing image process {{has come a long way}} and works well with GIS in synthesized analysis of environment on large scales. This study employs satellite remote sensing in combination with geographic information system to monitor and analyze temperatures in the whole aspects of a metropolis. This study applies the technology of satellite remote sensing to monitor and analyze temperatures in the whole aspects of a metropolis by reverse algorithm of the thermal IR section of the satellite images taken above Taichung City by the Landsat 5 satellite in 1995, 2009 and 2011 in order to obtain ground surface <b>luminance</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This study further calculates the intensities of heat island and investigates the distribution of the heat island effects by incorporating natural factors such as wind directions, wind speeds and ocean current to understand the current heat island effects in the metropolis of Taichung. Additionally, it has been discovered from the analytic results of the industrial parks, among which the peak intensities of heat island were between 0. 6 - 0. 7, that the industries inside the high-temperature areas included metal manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, electronics, chemical, optoelectronics, glassware, paper and textile industries, of which the machinery manufacturing and metal-related industries produced the strongest intensity of heat island...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the high}} {{lighting}} efficiency and long lifecycle, the light-emitting diode (LED) {{plays a major role}} in the green earth activities; energy saving and carbon offset. Since the LED lights have the better energy efficiency, they have gradually become the major source of LCD backlight. The luminance of LED light source must be adjusted suitably when used for the backlight source or lighting, therefore, the pulse wave modulation (PWM) is a commonly used technique for the LED light modulation. However, when the LED is applied to the field sequential color LCD for a long time, the trigger pulse will readily affect the LED light performance.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the design of}} a white light solid state lamp, presenting a controlled quality of the emitted luminous flux in terms of both <b>luminance</b> and color <b>temperature.</b> Exploiting the same principle of color mixing adopted in RGB light sources, the designed fixture is based on three LED arrays implementing two primary color emitters (red and green) and a cool white light source. The regulation of intensity and color temperature is achieved by independently adjusting, by PWM dimming, the luminance of each LED array. The compensation of temperature effects is implemented by a feed-forward controller, that only requires sensing the voltage drop of each LED array. The proposed design and digital control strategy is cost effective and guarantees color temperature variations lower than 2 % and full control of the lamp luminance...|$|R
40|$|A {{mixed model}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} construct optimal cross-over designs. In a cross-over experiment the same subject is tested {{at different points in}} time. Consider as an example an experiment to investigate the influence of physical attributes of the work environment such as <b>luminance,</b> ambient <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity on human performance of acceptance inspection in quality assurance. In a mixed model context, the subject effects are assumed to be independent and normally distributed. Besides the induction of correlated observations within the same inspector, the mixed model approach also enables one to specify the covariance structure of the inspection data. Here, several covariance structures are considered either depending on the time variable or not. Unfortunately, a serious drawback of the inspection experiment is that the results may be influenced by an unknown time trend because of inspector fatigue due to monotony of the inspection task. In other circumstances, time trend effects can be caused by learning effects of the test subjects in behavioural and life sciences, heating or aging of material in prototype experiments, etc. An algorithm is presented to construct cross-over designs that are optimally balanced for time trend effects. The costs for using the subjects and for altering the factor levels between consecutive observations can also be taken into account. A number of examples illustrate utility of the outlined design methodology. Optimal; Models; Model;...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of historical buildings are very energy inefficient; as energy costs continue to rise, they need smarter energy management strategies, since traditional ways of improving energy efficiency through structural retrofits are very expensive and not always possible in historical buildings. The paper shows {{the development of a}} new smart strategy to improve the energy efficiency of historical buildings without significant construction work. The strategy is based on Information Technologies and Wireless Sensor Networks, Building Information Modelling and interoperable energy simulation tools and also requires and stimulates an improvement of human awareness and competence. The paper reports the results of the first phase of the Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces project that addresses reduction in energy usage and the CO 2 footprint of existing public buildings and spaces, by an intelligent ICT-based service which monitors and manages the energy consumption. Preliminary results have led to the development of a middleware tool which enables the interoperability of software and Wireless Sensor Networks to monitor energy consumption, controlling environmental parameters such as <b>luminance</b> and <b>temperature</b> to take advantage of natural resources (i. e. daylight and solar energy) in order to ensure the best possible comfort conditions with the most efficient use of energy.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} perceptually meaningful image editing and present two techniques for manipulating the apparent depth of objects in an image. The user loads an image, selects an object and specifies whether the object should appear closer or further away. The system automatically determines target values for the object and/or background that achieve the desired depth change. These depth editing operations, based on techniques used by traditional artists, manipulate either the <b>luminance</b> or color <b>temperature</b> of {{different regions of the}} image. By performing blending in the gradient domain and reconstruction with a Poisson solver, the appearance of false edges is minimized.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to perform edge {{detection}} in color-infrared images from the point of view of Clifford algebras. The main idea is that such an image can be seen as a section of a Clifford bundle associated to the RGBT-space (Red, Green, Blue, Temperature) of acquisition. Dealing with geometric calculus and covariant derivatives of appropriate sections with respect to well-chosen connections allows to get various color and temperature information needed for the segmentation. We show in particular how to recover the first fundamental form of the image embedded in a LSHT-space (<b>Luminance,</b> Saturation, Hue, <b>Temperature)</b> equipped with a metric tensor. We propose applications to color edge detection with respect to a given hue interval and to edge detection in color-infrared images with constraints on temperature. Others applications related to different choices of connections, sections and embedding spaces for nD images may be considered from this general theorical framework...|$|R
40|$|Primates show {{activity}} patterns {{ranging from}} nocturnality to diurnality, {{with a few}} species showing activity both during day and night. Among anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans), nocturnality is only present in the Central and South American owl monkey genus Aotus. Unlike other tropical Aotus species, the Azara’s owl monkeys (A. azarai) of the subtropics have switched their activity pattern from strict nocturnality to one that also includes regular diurnal activity. Harsher climate, food availability, {{and the lack of}} predators or diurnal competitors, have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in primate activity patterns. However, the observational nature of most field studies has limited an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this switch in activity patterns. The goal of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that masking, namely the stimulatory and/or inhibitory/disinhibitory effects of environmental factors on synchronized circadian locomotor activity, is a key determinant of the unusual activity pattern of Azara’s owl monkeys. We use continuous longterm (6 – 18 months) 5 -min-binned activity records obtained with actimeter collars fitted to wild owl monkeys (n = 10 individuals) to show that this different pattern results from strong masking of activity by the inhibiting and enhancing effects of ambient <b>luminance</b> and <b>temperature.</b> Conclusive evidence for the direct masking effect of light is provided by data showing that locomotor activity was almost completely inhibited when moonlight was shadowed during three lunar eclipses. Temperature also negatively masked locomotor activity, and this masking was manifested even under optimal ligh...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{substantiate}} {{an extensive}} use of daylight in commercial buildings {{it is necessary to}} demonstrate that, other than just providing potential energy savings, natural lighting can foster further benefits (financial, environmental and in terms of productivity) for both the owners and the occupants. Specifying daylighting solutions for energy efficiency can be a very complex task, where many factors (e. g. illuminance, glare, solar gains, views) can diverge from each other making design choices extremely difficult. Nonetheless, to foster the design of energy-conscious buildings which are also conducive to human well-being, these variables have to be related with qualitative and behavioural factors such as time/duration of exposure, directionality and spectral composition of visible radiation, psychological stimulation and user preference. Correlating literature research with lighting standards and field measurements, this paper looks at the relationship between quantitative physical factors of the luminous environment (e. g. horizontal/vertical illuminance, <b>luminance</b> ratio, colour <b>temperature),</b> qualitative aspects of vision (e. g. uniformity, distribution, contrast) and physio-psychological human response to daylighting. The aim of the study consists in defining a framework to implement existing recommendations based not only on photopic requirements for visual tasks but also containing awareness of the demands for photobiological stimulation that can influence the well-being of occupants, whilst also enhancing energy savings...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of LED lighting, nowadays designers and architects have more flexibility to evoke emotions and create certain atmospheres in a space by means of artificial lighting. The perceived atmosphere in a space is an experience of the surroundings in relation to ourselves; it is an affective evaluation of the environment (Scholten et al., 2003; Vogels, 2008). Previous studies related to atmosphere perception have given valuable insight into the relation between white light and the perceived atmosphere (Vogels et al., 2008). Moreover, in (Seuntiens and Vogels, 2008) four atmospheres (cosy, relaxing, activating and exciting) were designed by professional lighting designer for a standard living room and verified by end users. This study found clear commonalities between the professional lighting designers {{with respect to the}} chosen light characteristics to evoke a certain atmosphere in the room. However, it was not clear how much variation in light characteristics was allowed before an initially perceived atmosphere disappears. In the present research three experiments were conducted to investigate the allowed variation in light characteristics (<b>luminance,</b> color <b>temperature,</b> hue and saturation) on two atmospheres, namely cosy and activating. In the first study, a tuning experiment was conducted in order to investigate the allowed variation in light characteristics on the initially perceived “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere. In general, the results of the first experiment showed that participants allowed quite some variation in light characteristics in both atmospheres. On average participants allowed an increase in luminance of the white light sources of a factor two to four compared to the initial luminance level, and a decrease in luminance of at least a factor of two. Furthermore, a consistent change of about 800 K was allowed for the increase in color temperature in the “cosy” atmosphere and the decrease in color temperature in the “activating” atmosphere. Due to technical limitations, the decrease in color temperature in the “cosy” atmosphere and the increase in color temperature in the “activating” atmosphere were not investigated in this study. Finally, the allowed change in hue and chroma of the colored luminaires was found to be larger in the “activating” atmosphere than in the “cosy” atmosphere. In order to investigate the effect of a change in light characteristics on the perceived atmosphere, a difference scaling experiment was conducted. In this experiment, participants compared the average allowed change in light settings as obtained from the first study to the light settings corresponding to a “cosy” or “activating” atmosphere as reference. A short version of the original atmosphere questionnaire of Vogels (2008) was used to assess the perceived atmosphere in the room. The results showed that an increase in luminance of the white light sources reduced the cosiness and tenseness of the atmosphere, and enlarged its liveliness and detachment (with a reverse effect for a decrease in luminance). A decrease in color temperature was found to increase the cosiness, and to reduce the liveliness and detachment of the atmosphere. With regard to the colored luminaires, a change in hue was found to mainly affect the cosiness and detachment, whereas a decrease in chroma mainly affected the liveliness and detachment. In a follow-up experiment participants assessed the perceived atmosphere for the allowed change in light settings without the initial “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere as a reference to compare with. In general, similar trends with respect to the changes in the atmosphere were found, however, the effects were considerably smaller. This indicates that participants found it more difficult to distinguish the atmosphere related to the different light settings when they could not directly compare them. In this study, boundaries for the allowed variation in <b>luminance,</b> color <b>temperature,</b> hue and chroma were obtained for the “cosy” and “activating” atmosphere. In addition, the results gave further insight into the relation between light and perceived atmosphere. However, this research also has its limitations in the sense that some light characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of the light, and its dynamics, as well as the spatial configuration of the light sources, were not included. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these aspects on perceived atmosphere further. Man-Machine Interaction GroupElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} a novel concept called perceptually meaningful image editing and present techniques for manipulating the apparent depth {{of objects and}} creating the illusion of motion in 2 D images. Our techniques combine principles of human visual perception with approaches developed by traditional artists. For our depth manipulation technique, the user loads an image, selects an object and specifies whether the object should appear closer or further away. The system automatically determines <b>luminance</b> or color <b>temperature</b> target values for the object and/or background that achieve the desired depth change. Our approach for creating the illusion of motion exploits the differences between our peripheral vision and our foveal vision by introducing spatial imprecision to the image. quite substantial. In fact, many of the visual effects created by traditional artists can now be {{explained in terms of}} the features of the human visual system. By tapping into this wealth of knowledge, a new class of image editing techniques which are perceptually meaningful can be developed. We define a perceptually meaningful editing technique as one designed to explicitly trigger certain visual cues. In this paper we present two such techniques- one designed to manipulate the apparent depth of objects in an image and the other designed to introduce the illusion of motion to an otherwise visually static image. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{relationship}} among current density distribution, heat and temperature based on current continuity equation, ohm law and three-dimensional heat transfer model. The relationship between luminance distribution and current spreading of GaN blue light emitting diode (LED) is studied. Luminance distribution is {{proved to be an}} effective method of distinguishing the performance of current spreading. Because of the close relationship among <b>temperature,</b> <b>luminance</b> distribution and current density, a qualitative method of optimizing electrode structure and current spreading is proposed. With different currents and heat sink temperatures, the current non-uniformity and the luminance distribution of LED are analyzed. Temperature or current density crowding results in heat accumulation, increase of non-radiative recombination and the restriction of the emitting photons, hence thermal flux is an important factor influencing the luminance distribution. Through carrier transport mechanism, the reason for the <b>temperature</b> influence on <b>luminance</b> distribution is explained. Optimized contact electrode structure can improve current spreading and luminance uniformity, also considerably increase the reliability of high power LED.

40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} studied by applying methods of direct scaling to color appearances of stimuli perceived under different conditions of adaptation. This study differs from previous work {{in a number of}} ways. The color appearances of surface color stimuli were scaled by both magnitude estimation and magnitude production psychophysical methods. Changes in color appearances resulting from variations in correlated color temperature of adapting illumination, luminance factors of samples, illuininance, and surround induction conditions were scaled by a group of seven observers who had been trained to describe their perceptions in a uniform manner. This factorial approach to chromatic adaptation- influences on color appearance has yielded information about changes throughout a color solid rather than a single planar section of that solid. A distinction was made between absolute and relative attributes of color appearance. valuations of both internal and external consistency indicate that the data generated have relatively high precision and validity. The results indicate that chromatic adaptation induces smooth, continuous changes in color appearance. The nature of these changes depends upon correlated color <b>temperature,</b> <b>luminance</b> factor, and illuminance of surface color stimuli. Saturation, or colorfulness, is most susceptible to change and is highly dependent upon luminance factor and illuminance in addition to color temperature. These dependencies are systematic and explicit in the results presented here. Hue appearance of a given sample depends primarily upon color temperature of adapting illumination. Little or no change in hue was found for the range of variation in illuminance and luminance factor included in this study. In general, the hues of' all stimuli change with adaptation but there are important exceptions. The results do not support a linear model for the chromatic adaptation process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{the formation}} and systemization of a basis of knowledge and information, which is indispensable to turn a design support for kinetic structures into representation {{by means of a}} 3 d animating program. Representation of kinetic structures by means of the existing ordinary software sources is possible, Nevertheless, such representation lacks of different important features and functions and results eventually in the total absence of a real model of the construction, which is valuable to the user of the program especially in the field of the kinetics, where everything depends on the movement: design not only requires, but demands for visualisation. A personal interest in kinetic architecture and therefore in the physical movement of structural elements in a building, as well as an attempt to “fathom” the possibility of changing this concept to visualization and modern reality by the use of a software are the main incentives of this master thesis. First, a general research will be performed in order to check the existence of similar or semisimilar proposals. The area in which the research will be held is the Bibliography in kinetic architecture and parametric design. A comparison of animation and 3 D prototype software in well-known programs will focus on whether virtual weather conditions are considered as a parameter to the animation {{of the structure of the}} programs and case studies of several existing kinetic structures will be performed, in order to point out flaws and/or helpful commands in the programs in connection with the presentation of kinetic architecture. Criteria for the choice of the software: ability to customise and to produce geometric modelling, animation in relation to time (video animation) and the simulation after taking into consideration weather factors.
