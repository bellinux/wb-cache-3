Instead of offering a <b>linear</b> <b>set</b> of tracks for recording, the TS required the user to record short sequences (12 tracks each) {{to use as a}} base for song structure, then chaining them and optionally layering another 12 linear tracks on top of the chained blocks. The sequencer editing options included quantization with audition, controller editing and scaling and MIDI functions per track, as well as copying whole or parts of tracks to anywhere else. The keyboard could store up to 30 songs with 100 sequences per song, memory-permitting, and everything was kept in memory when the synth was turned off. Modern synthesizers, with larger and better sequencers, demand the user to save their work before power down, since the sequencer memory is not backed up.|$|E

They would approach the Solar System with random velocities, mostly from the region of the constellation Hercules because the Solar System is moving in that direction. The fact that no comet with a speed greater than the Sun's escape velocity has yet been seen places upper limits to their density in interstellar space. A paper by Torbett indicates that the density is no more than 1013 (10 trillion) comets per cubic parsec.

5000|$|The {{mathematical}} models used {{in classical}} electromagnetism, quantum electrodynamics (QED) {{and the standard}} model all view the electromagnetic force as a <b>linear</b> <b>set</b> of equations. In these theories electromagnetism is a U(1) gauge theory, whose topological properties do not allow any complex nonlinear interaction of a field with and on itself. For example, in the QED vacuum the field fluctuates randomly {{as a consequence of}} the uncertainty principle but these fluctuations cancel each other out with no overall observable effect. However, there are many observed nonlinear physical electromagnetic phenomena such as Aharonov-Bohm (AB) and Altshuler-Aronov- Spivak (AAS) effects, Berry, Aharonov- Anandan, Pancharatnam and Chiao-Wu phase rotation effects, Josephson effect, Quantum Hall effect, the de Haas-van Alphen effect, the Sagnac effect and many other physically observable phenomena which would indicate that the electromagnetic potential field has real physical meaning rather than being a mathematical artifact and therefore an all encompassing theory would not confine electromagnetism as a local force as is currently done, but as a SU(2) gauge theory or higher geometry. Higher symmetries allow for nonlinear, aperiodic behaviour which manifest as a variety of complex non-equilibrium phenomena that do not arise in the linearised U(1) theory, such as multiple stable states, symmetry breaking, chaos and emergence. [...] In higher symmetry groups, the electromagnetic field is not a calm, randomly fluctuating, passive substance, but can at times can be viewed as a turbulent virtual plasma that can have complex vortices, entangled states and a rich nonlinear structure.|$|E
50|$|As a {{constraint}} matures in {{the design}} flow, it tends to work its way {{from the end of}} the flow to the beginning.As it does this, it also tends to increase in complexity and in the degree that it contends with other constraints.Constraints tend to move up in the flow due to one of the basic paradoxes of design: accuracy vs.influence. Specifically, the earlier in a design flow a constraint is addressed, the more flexibility there is toaddress the constraint. Ironically, the earlier one is in a design flow, the more difficult it is to predict compliance.For example, an architectural decision to pipeline a logic function can have a far greater impact ontotal chip performance than any amount of postrouting fix-up. At the same time, accurately predicting theperformance impact of such a change before the chip logic is synthesized, let alone placed or routed, is verydifficult. This paradox has shaped the evolution of the design closure flow in several ways. First, it requiresthat the design flow is no longer composed of a <b>linear</b> <b>set</b> of discrete steps. In the early stages of VLSI it wassufficient to break the design into discrete stages, i.e., first do logic synthesis, then do placement, then dorouting. As the number and complexity of design closure constraints has increased, the linear design flowhas broken down. In the past if there were too many timing constraint violations left after routing, it wasnecessary to loop back, modify the tool settings slightly, and reexecute the previous placement steps. If theconstraints were still not met, it was necessary to reach further back in the flow and modify the chip logicand repeat the synthesis and placement steps. This type of looping is both time consuming and unable toguarantee convergence i.e., it is possible to loop back in the flow to correct one constraint violation only tofind that the correction induced another unrelated violation.|$|E
