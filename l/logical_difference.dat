40|$|Abstract. Ontologies undergo {{changes for}} reasons such as changes in knowledge, meeting varying {{application}} requirements. Thus, for {{different versions of}} a considered ontology, {{it is important to}} clarify the difference between them. The difference above refers to the <b>logical</b> <b>difference,</b> not syntactic one. Examples of the <b>logical</b> <b>difference</b> include the difference in taxonomy, concept subsumption difference and query difference. These has been well investigated for the lightweight description logicEL because of its tractability and successful application in bio-medical ontologies. FuzzyEL + has been put forward and applied in view-based searching in Semantic portals. Thus comes the problem of comparing fuzzy ontologies of different versions and clarifying the difference. In this paper, we define the <b>logical</b> <b>difference</b> of two fuzzyEL + ontologies. For fuzzyEL + ontologies of different versions we investigate how to compute the difference in taxonomy and concept subsumption difference. We also explore how to compute approximation of the <b>logical</b> <b>difference</b> of twoEL terminologies. Our work can be applied in the scenario of EL + ontologies with access control if the set of all access rights is a linear order. ...|$|E

For the lightweight description logic EL, we present a tractable algorithm which, given two terminologies and a signature, outputs a set of concepts, which {{can be regarded as}} the <b>logical</b> <b>difference</b> between the two terminologies. As a consequence, the algorithm can also decide whether they imply the same concept implications in the signature. A prototype implementation CEX of this algorithm is presented and experimental results based on distinct versions of Snomed ct, the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms, are discussed. Finally, results regarding the relation to uniform interpolants and possible extensions to more expressive description logics are presented. ...|$|E

Existing approaches do so by explicitly specifying variation points inside the architectural specification of the entire product line, usually with optional and alternative elements of some form.

We contribute a new product line architecture modeling approach that unites the two. Our approach uses change sets to group related architectural differences and relationships to govern which change set combinations are valid when composed into a particular product architecture.

40|$|Wittgenstein {{attached}} overarching personal {{importance to}} questions of moral value. Yet his written treatments of ethics are brief and obscure, while his views on language have had a strong, albeit intermittent and diffuse, influence on analytic moral philosophy. His remarks on ethics seem to be totally at odds with realist and cognitivist accounts. Both the Tractatus and 'A Lecture on Ethics' maintain that ethics transcends linguistic expression, and later remarks seem to point {{in the direction of}} a communal variant of expressivism and relativism. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language was invoked in the 1980 s by Oxford philosophers like John McDowell and Sabina Lovibond against the still prevailing non-cognitivist mainstream. These ‘anti-anti-realists’ maintained that, from a Wittgensteinian perspective, all indicative sentences, including moral ones, make claims to truth. My article discusses this proposal, historically, exegetically, and substantively. Anti-anti-realism (AAR) chimes with Wittgenstein’s deflationary account of truth. But that account is not committed to the conclusion that all propositions that can be called ‘true’ or ‘false’ have the same semantic status. Indeed, anti-anti-realism is at odds with Wittgenstein’s view that the similarity in linguistic form disguises <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> between moral and descriptive proposition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} explore for what {{purposes}} and by what means medieval personal names {{can be used}} in social historical research. Bynames derived from place names are examined in the present paper, as they prove to be essential sources in research into medieval migration history. From registers {{and to a lesser extent}} from charters of other types (sales contracts, civil procedural documents), the author has collected approximately 12, 000 personal names of serfs and burghers. Information on migration history deduced from the names (e. g. distance, legal status of the previous place of residence) is compared with the characteristics of medieval urban development. In doing so, the author relies on the so-called centrality score system, elaborated by András Kubinyi, which at present is the most accepted and effective method in research into urban, and more broadly, settlement history. With respect to the seven categories of settlements defined by Kubinyi, one can observe substantial and <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> concerning the proportion of the incomers, the distance of migration and the legal status of the emissive settlements. These facts also suggest that Kubinyi’s categories (in fact, hierarchical levels demonstrating prosperity) do identify settlements at different levels of their development...|$|R
40|$|The `Full Chip' module of an ASIC {{is made up}} {{of various}} {{partitions}} and similar to individual partitions, it also goes through various stages of the physical design. The initial design-planning works on the existing pins of a partition, adds feed-thru pins and performs custom placement and routing on signal and clock nets. Near tape-in, ECO (Engineering Change Order) forces manual changes to design as opposed to taking it through full implementation cycle. At the final stages, when layout database of each partition meets the requirements, a bottom up integration is carried out to create full chip layout. All these stages can create <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> between layout and RTL of the top level interface. In order to verify that no unintentional logical change has happened to full chip, a robust formal verification strategy with numerous practical considerations is necessary.

Global macroeconomy changes imply a new set of rules that are followed by the economies of the region and a redefinition of the terms to face the problems of access to income and ways of overcoming food insecurity and poverty in the rural and peri-urban areas. The agriculture sectorial context contemplates critical aspects for the design of strategies to alleviate poverty: the phenomena of dual-modality of agrarian structures (co-existence of a peasant and entrepreneurial agriculture with the <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> in the management of their resources); the important differences of the peasant sector itself and the growth of non agricultural rural employment at rates far superior that those of agriculture, which are decreasing in various countries. The wide scope of the heterogeneity of poverty demands that there be more ways to have access to employment or other forms of income. This supposedly implies the elaboration of typologies for the design of differentiated policies based on these forms, in particular, the different combinations of small land employment and rural agricultural and non agricultural employment with urban or peri-urban employment. Highly diversified technological demand to supply agro/silvicultural/pasture eco-regional scenarios, together with crops and cropping alternatives for intensive rural and peri-urban production of quality and innocuous products, require...|$|R

A secondary objective is to identify whether differences in seven modeling characteristics are related to differences in outcome of these cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed full economic evaluations of endocrine treatments of early breast cancer published in the English language between 2000 and December 2010. Information from these publications was abstracted regarding outcome, quality, and modeling methods. ResultsWe identified 20 economic evaluations comprising 5 different endocrine therapeutic strategies, which are all assessed more then once. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the reported outcomes varied widely for identical therapies. For anastrazole compared to tamoxifen, incremental life-years gained even ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 550 with an ICER ranging from € 3, 958 to € 75, 331. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained ranged from 0. 092 to 0. 378 with a cost per QALY gained varying from € 3, 696 to € 120, 265. These large differences in outcome were related to different modeling methods, with differences in time horizon and use of a carryover effect as most prominent causes. ConclusionDespite similar comparators and <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> due to transferability issues, the outcomes of the included studies varied widely. To increase comparability and transparency of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, standardization of modeling methods for different therapeutic groups/diseases and the availability of a detailed and complete description of the model used in the evaluation is advocated.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} {{faunistic}} diversification and refers to part of the distribution area of a sciaenid fish Micropogon furnieri (Desmarest, 1822) Jordan & Evermann 1884, widely distributed. Such species is characteristic of the tropical area and occurs along the Brazilian coast with highest abundance south of Cabo Frio. The analysis of variations of six meristic characters and eight body proportions and of some reproduction and growth features has shown that along the coast between latitudes 23 ºS and 33 ºS diversifi cation occurs within the species; such diversification implies {{in the existence of}} two populations, one occupying the area between 23 ºS and 29 ºS (area I) and the other between 29 ºS and 33 ºS (area II). The eco <b>logical</b> <b>differences</b> between the two mentioned areas according to our point of view is the reason for the species diversification in the whole area under observation. The differences recorded as the characteristics studied were suf ficient enough to illustrate the existence of two populations reproductively isolated suggesting that some gene exchange, if any, between both populations occurs in a very low rate. Our results show that abundance estimates of M. furnieri in this area must be made for each population as a whole until further studies on genetic characters are developed which may confirm the existence of gene exchange and if so, the gene flow rate. As the present study does not cover the total area of occurrence of Micropogon furnieri no hypothesis is extended to the general pattern of diversification (eventual presence of sub-species) and no systematic "status" and names are given to the populations identified...|$|R

Isolated femoral adipocytes from white women were more responsive to insulin than those from black women with 0. 72 mno]/l causing a 55 + 4 % inhibition of isoprotorenol-stimulated lipolysis compared to a 27 + 10 % inhibition in black women (p< 0. 01). Furthermore, isolated femoral adipocytes from white women showed improved glucose uptake (247 + 36 %) than those from black women (128 + 28 %) in the presence o f 7. 0 nmol/l insulin (p< 0. 05). The low responsiveness of adipocyte lipolytic activity to insulin in black women in the presence o f relatively low insulin levels, may account for the high plasma FFA levels observed in these women which may, in turn account for their higher in vivo insulin resistance. It is proposed that the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance within the black obese population is strongly influenced by their adipocyte metabolism. 1, Ernest Philani Buthelezi, declare that this dissertation is my own work and has not been submitted or incorporated in another dissertation or thesis for any other degree...|$|R

The reader is reminded that the argumentative framework of my paper was set by Hans Crombag’s interpretation of the present doctrine of human rights as a sympathetic but naïve legacy of the classical theory of natural law. It is Crombag’s view—one that is shared by many positivists like him—that that theory is basically the same whether it is presented by an Aristotle, a Thomas Aquinas, or a John Locke. It is not my view. Indeed, as I wrote in the paper, I did “not intend to add to or comment on the long debate [...] . on the relationship between the classical theories of natural law (in the tradition of Saint Thomas) and natural rights (the Lockean tradition). ” For my purpose, it was enough to argue that the present doctrine of human rights fits a Hobbesian view of human beings and their relationships, but does not fit either a Lockean or a Thomistic or an Aristotelian view of those things. It was not necessary—indeed it would have been false—to argue that the latter authors share the same view.
