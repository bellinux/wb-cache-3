5|$|Jeff Gordon {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner. Reutimann made contact with Johnson, forcing him to collide with the wall and damage his car's suspension on lap two. The first caution of the race was subsequently given. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution, and Johnson drove to his garage to change his front and rear suspension. Jeff Gordon maintained his lead on the lap eight restart. Kurt Busch passed Jeff Gordon on the <b>low</b> <b>side</b> of the track for the lead position four laps later. After starting twenty-ninth, Robby Gordon had moved up thirteen positions to sixteenth by lap 34. One lap later, Johnson's car was fitted with a new driveshaft.|$|E
5|$|The term men's bikini is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} swim briefs. Men's bikinis can have high or <b>low</b> <b>side</b> panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and sun tanning. The posing brief standard to bodybuilding competitions {{is an example of}} this style. Male punk rock musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs. The 2000 Bollywood film Hera Pheri shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be women from a distance.|$|E

25|$|Gordon C. Rhea {{acknowledges}} the officially reported Union casualties of 17,666, but suspects {{that some of}} the returns—particularly in Warren's corps—were falsified on the <b>low</b> <b>side,</b> to minimize the negative impact of the battle on the public. He estimates Grant's loss at 17%. He accepts Union estimates of 11,000 Confederate casualties.|$|E
25|$|Side reins {{are usually}} used for more {{advanced}} horses. They give the horse something {{to take contact}} with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too <b>low.</b> <b>Side</b> reins may be attached from the bit to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to the billets of the girth.|$|E
25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to {{the window in the}} north wall. The other is a <b>low</b> <b>side</b> window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter and may have been used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E

25|$|Originally the Low German house {{took its}} {{simplest}} and basic form, the Zweiständerhaus or two-post farmhouse. This had {{two rows of}} uprights on which the ceiling joists rested. The two rows of posts {{ran the length of}} the building and created the great central threshing floor or Diele characteristic of this type of farmhouse. On the outside of the rows of uprights, underneath the eaves, <b>low</b> <b>side</b> rooms or bays known as Kübbungen were often built with non load-bearing external walls. These Kübbungen acted as stables or stalls for the cattle and gave this type of house its alternative name of Kübbungshaus. A classic feature of the Zweiständerhaus is that the loft is not supported by the outside walls but only by the two rows of uprights that form part of the hall sides or walls.|$|E
500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the <b>low</b> <b>side,</b> by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that's it. They never showed us any accounts, and then they got bought out by Sony." ...|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a <b>low</b> <b>side</b> run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E

Prior to restoration work performed between 1990 and 2001, the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees, but the tower now leans at about 3.99 degrees. This means {{the top of the}} tower is displaced horizontally [...] from the centre.|$|E

A likely Moot Hill as it is unclear where the chapel stood. Also known as the Monk's {{graveyard}} and Jockey's cap, as it {{was used as a}} viewing platform to watch horse races at festival times. A Moot Hill of Chapelton is recorded in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland as being specifically excluded by King James from a grant of lands including Lainshaw, Robertland and Gallowberry to Alexander Hume in the 15th-century.|$|E

50|$|In a sauté, all the {{ingredients}} are heated at once, and cooked quickly. To facilitate this, {{the ingredients}} are rapidly moved around in the pan, either {{by the use of}} a utensil, or by repeatedly jerking the pan itself. A sauté pan must be large enough to hold all of the food in one layer, so steam can escape, which keeps the ingredients from stewing and promotes the development of fond. Most pans sold specifically as sauté pans have a wide flat base and <b>low</b> <b>sides,</b> to maximize the surface area available for heating. The <b>low</b> <b>sides</b> allow quick evaporation and escape of steam. While skillets typically have flared or rounded sides, sauté pans typically have straight, vertical sides. This keeps the ingredients from escaping as the pan is jerked or stirred.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{layout of}} Anglo-Saxon churches {{was a tall}} nave without aisles linked to a smaller, square-ended (not apsidal) chancel by a chancel arch. [...] St John the Baptist's Church follows this form; and the nave and chancel arch, along with parts of {{the north and south}} chancel walls, survive from the 11th century. [...] On {{the north side of the}} nave, fragmentary remains of a 12th-century porticus (a <b>low</b> <b>side</b> chapel, similar to a transept) can be seen: on the inside, there is a blocked round-headed opening, while on the outside a roofline is visible. [...] A similar porticus of the 13th century existed on the south side; its remnants can still be seen.|$|E
2500|$|Smith, {{the well}} known antiquarian, in 1895 {{describes}} the mound as being 22 paces in diameter, [...] {{high on the}} <b>low</b> <b>side</b> and [...] high on the high side. He states that it is well cared for and that a flight of steps, not clearly visible today, ran up from its base to the top. However significantly he makes no reference to any remains of the chapel itself. The 1897 25" [...] to the mile OS shows a path at the Chapelhill House side of the mound and a possibly a curving path or steps up. Smith also states that the mound was repaired some fifty years before, which fits in with the approximate dates for the likely construction of the Chapelton (old) house, by or for James McAlister who is given {{as the owner of}} Chapelton at around this time, and it is stated in 1874 that the chapel ruins were found some 40 years before, i.e. around 1834. The 1846 record states that they had been found recently however (Topo Dict Scot).|$|E

60|$|After {{a minute}} or two he saw the punt; she was {{swinging}} about in the rush of tide and seemed to forge towards him. A rippling line marked her painter. He stopped swimming and let himself drift. He must not be carried past; and presently he made a quick stroke and felt a triumphant thrill when his numbed fingers clutched the craft's <b>low</b> <b>side.</b> For all that, he had not conquered yet. He was tired, and it is hard to get on board a floating punt.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo ran {{off after}} the umbrella, very much {{interested}} in proving to James, by actual experiment, that the air was a real thing. When he came with it, he was himself inclined {{to make the first}} experiment from the <b>low</b> <b>side</b> of the shed. He could climb up, by means of a fence at the corner. James advised him, however, to try it first from the end of a woodpile, which was pretty high, but yet not so high as the shed. James was not quite sure that the experiment would succeed, and he was afraid that Rollo might get hurt.|$|E
