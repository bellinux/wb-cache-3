5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin <b>ligase.</b> The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with <b>ligase</b> by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and <b>ligase</b> activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane, which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A <b>ligase.</b> Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|DNA <b>ligase</b> III {{along with}} its {{cofactor}} XRCC1 catalyzes the nick-sealing step in short-patch BER in humans. DNA <b>ligase</b> I ligates the break in long-patch BER.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} implicates the supplementary role of {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA <b>ligase</b> I's function of joining Okazaki fragments. When the PCNA binding site on DNA <b>ligase</b> I is inactive, DNA <b>ligase</b> I's {{ability to connect}} Okazaki fragments is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes Okazaki fragments, the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA <b>ligase</b> I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the lagging strand, and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.|$|E
25|$|DNA <b>ligase</b> 3 is {{an enzyme}} that in humans is encoded by the LIG3 gene.|$|E
25|$|Recently, new {{findings}} have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of teratogenicity. Cereblon is a 51 kDa protein localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous {{parts of the}} body. It acts {{as a component of}} the E3 ubiquitin <b>ligase,</b> regulating various developmental processes, including embryogenesis, carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation, through degradation (ubiquitination) of unknown substrates. Thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon, inhibiting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin <b>ligase,</b> resulting in accumulation of the <b>ligase</b> substrates and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and FGF10. This disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors, possibly causing both multiple birth defects and anti-myeloma effects.|$|E
25|$|NS5 : the {{presence}} of this 105 kDa protein results in inactivation of STAT2 (via the signal transduction of the response to interferon) when it is expressed alone. When NS5 is cleaved with NS4B by a protease (NS2B3) it can degrade STAT2. In fact, after the cleavage of NS5 by the protease, there is an E3 <b>ligase</b> association with STAT2, and the E3 <b>ligase</b> targets STAT2 for the degradation.|$|E
25|$|Stability – A {{subset of}} docking motifs recruit E3 {{ubiquitin}} <b>ligase</b> to their substrates. The resulting polyubiquitination targets the substrate for proteosomal destruction.|$|E
25|$|Johanson–Blizzard {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} mutations in the UBR1 gene, which encodes one of several ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> enzymes of the N-end rule pathway.|$|E
25|$|This first {{successful}} evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could {{provide support for}} the RNA World hypothesis. In another recent study, an RNA <b>ligase</b> ribozyme was converted into a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution of the inactive deoxyribo-analog of the ribozyme. The new RNA <b>ligase</b> deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which {{had no effect on}} activity, and had a catalytic efficiency of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4L is a {{ubiquitin}}-protein <b>ligase</b> (E3) that accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in {{the form}} of a thioester and then transfers it to specific substrates.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the enzyme}} {{responsible}} for the backbone cyclization of cyclotides has been isolated from the medicinal plant Clitoria ternatea. This enzyme was named butelase 1 in accordance to the local name of the plant (Bunga Telang <b>Ligase).</b> Butelase 1 {{has been shown to}} cyclize the linear precursor of kalata B1 with >95% yield at a remarkable rate of 5.42×105 M1 s1. The <b>ligase</b> also cyclizes various bioactive peptides of animal origin, such as human antimicrobial peptide histatin, conotoxin from cone snail and insect antimicrobial peptide thanatin.|$|E
25|$|First, gamma-glutamylcysteine is {{synthesized}} from L-glutamate and cysteine via {{the enzyme}} gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (glutamate cysteine <b>ligase,</b> GCL). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Cullin-4B is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the CUL4B gene {{which is located}} on the X chromosome. The extreme N-terminus of CUL4B is disordered and, currently, it is unclear what {{structural}} and functional qualities it possesses. CUL4B binds to the beta-propeller of the DDB1 adaptor protein which interacts with numerous DDB1-CUL4-Associated Factors (DCAFs). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of substrates to the ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> complex. At the C-terminal end, CUL4B interacts with the RBX1/ROC1 protein via its RING domain. RBX1 is a core component of Cullin-RING ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> (CRL) complexes and functions to recruit E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. Therefore, the C-terminus of CUL4B - along with RBX1 and activated E2 enzymes - compose the catalytic core of CRL4B complexes. CUL4B is also modified by covalent attachment of a NEDD8 molecule at a highly conserved lysine residue in the C-terminal region. This modification appears to induce conformational changes which promotes flexibility in the RING domain of cullin proteins and enhanced ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|E3 ubiquitin-protein <b>ligase</b> NEDD4 {{also known}} as neural {{precursor}} cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the NEDD4 gene.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 {{can also}} {{function}} independently of its ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> activity. NEDD4 interacts with VEGFR2, {{leading to the}} degradation of VEGFR2 irrespective of whether the HECT domain is catalytically active.|$|E
25|$|The S.cerevisiae protein Swe1 is also {{regulated}} by degradation. Swe1 is hyperphosphorylated by Clb2-Cdc28 and Cdc5 {{which may be}} a signal for ubiquitination and degradation by SCF E3 ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> complex as in higher eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|The protein complex SCFβ-TrCP1/2 is an E3 {{ubiquitin}} <b>ligase</b> that {{functions in}} Wee1A ubiquitination. The M-phase kinases Polo-like kinase (Plk1) and Cdc2 phosphorylate two serine residues in Wee1A which are recognized by SCFβ-TrCP1/2.|$|E
25|$|In JBS, {{mutations}} in the UBR1 gene alter, disrupt or prevent {{the synthesis of}} ubiquitin <b>ligase.</b> In the pancreatic acinar cells, UBR1 is more highly expressed {{than anywhere else in}} the body. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system directly related to insufficient activity of ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> has been established as the cause of both congenital and progressive inflammatory damage, fatty tissue replacement, connective tissue proliferation and errors in innervation of the acini and islets, correlating to failures of normal apoptotic destruction of damaged cells and constitutive malpresence of proteins. This also applies to other areas affected by deleterious UBR1 expression, such as the craniofacial area, musculoskeletal and nervous systems, dentition and organs.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 can bind and ubiquitinate the {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC), leading to down-regulation of sodium channel activity. However, in vivo studies have implicated the NEDD4 family member NEDD4-2 {{as the main}} <b>ligase</b> responsible for ENaC regulation.|$|E
25|$|The high optimum {{temperature}} for T. aquaticus allows researchers to study reactions under conditions for which other enzymes lose activity. Other enzymes isolated from this organism include DNA <b>ligase,</b> alkaline phosphatase, NADH oxidase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, amylomaltase, and fructose 1,6-disphosphate-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} cell long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA <b>ligase</b> catalyzes the {{reaction}} between a fatty acid molecule with ATP (which is broken down to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate) {{to give a}} fatty acyl-adenylate, which then reacts with free coenzyme A to give a fatty acyl-CoA molecule.|$|E
25|$|Detyrosination: {{the removal}} of the C-terminal {{tyrosine}} from alpha-tubulin. This reaction exposes a glutamate at the new C-terminus. As a result, microtubules that accumulate this modification are often referred to as Glu-microtubules. Although the tubulin carboxypeptidase has yet to be identified, the tubulin—tyrosine <b>ligase</b> (TTL) is known.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest are DNA ligases. These molecules have demonstrated remarkable chemoselectivity in RNA branching reactions. Although each repeating unit in a RNA strand owns a free hydroxyl group, the DNA <b>ligase</b> takes {{just one of}} them as a branching starting point. An accomplishment unattainable with traditional organic chemistry.|$|E
25|$|The NEDD4-2 protein {{consists}} of an amino-terminal Ca2+-phospholipid binding domain (C2), 4 WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains) and the carboxyl-terminal HECT domain (ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> domain). The WW domains in the protein are responsible for binding the substrates, regulatory proteins and adaptors. These domains generally recognize PPxY (or similar) motifs in the target proteins.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Liddle's Syndrome {{has been}} implicated with {{autosomal}} dominant activating mutations in the WW interaction motif in the β-(SCNNB_HUMA) and γ-(SCNNG_HUMA) subunits of the Epithelial sodium channel ENaC. These mutations abrogate the binding to the ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> NEDD4, thereby inhibiting channel degradation and prolonging the half-life of ENaC, ultimately resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption, plasma volume extension and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 {{activity}} can be regulated by auto-inhibition, whereby the C2 domain binds to the HECT domain {{to create an}} inhibitory conformation of the protein. This auto-inhibitory conformation can be disrupted {{by the presence of}} calcium, by proteins that bind to NEDD4 to prevent this conformation, or by phosphorylation of NEDD4 at specific tyrosine residues to activate NEDD4 ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|Missense, {{nonsense}} and {{splice site}} mutations of the UBR1 gene in both {{parents have been}} found with JBS, confirming the homozygous nature of the JBS phenotype. Variability of the phenotype, associated with residual ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> activity in some patients, has also been attributed to hypomorphic mutations occasionally found in either of the carrier parents. The UBR1 gene is located on human chromosome 15.|$|E
25|$|Rising {{levels of}} sterols {{increase}} the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and proteolysis. Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase transmembrane domain sense {{the higher levels}} of cholesterol, {{which leads to the}} exposure of Lysine 248. This lysine residue can become ubiquinated by the E3 <b>ligase</b> AMFR, serving as a signal for proteolytic degradation.|$|E
25|$|During {{lagging strand}} synthesis, DNA <b>ligase</b> I connects the Okazaki fragments, {{following}} {{replacement of the}} RNA primers with DNA nucleotides by DNA polymerase δ. Okazaki fragments that are not ligated could cause double-strand-breaks, which cleaves the DNA. Since {{only a small number}} of double-strand breaks are tolerated, and only a small number can be repaired, enough ligation failures could be lethal to the cell.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's teratogenic action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000. As of 2015 the main theories were inhibition {{of the process of}} angiogenesis, its inhibition of cereblon, a ubiquitin <b>ligase,</b> and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species which in turn kill cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of recombinant DNA {{is in many}} ways the simplest step of the molecular cloning process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA <b>ligase)</b> that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA mixture containing randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the host organism.|$|E
25|$|Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, {{which are}} {{synthesized}} but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote {{the initiation of}} mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin <b>ligase</b> known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.|$|E
