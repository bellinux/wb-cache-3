40|$|Everyone uses <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> {{in their}} daily life, like knife and fork. Moreover, many people use <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> in their {{profession}} as well as during leisure time. It is important that they can work with <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> that provide comfort. Until now, the avoidance of discomfort was emphasized during the design process of <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> like screwdrivers, <b>hand</b> saws and paint brushes. In the near future, the focus will shift towards providing comfort. However, some questions need to be answered to make this shift, like: What does the end-user mean with comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools?</b> How can we translate this into <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> design and the design proces? How can we evaluate <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> on comfort? These questions are answered in the current thesis. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|To design {{comfortable}} <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> {{knowledge about}} comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> is required. We investigated which factors determine comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> according to users. Therefore, descriptors of comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> {{were collected from}} literature and interviews. After that, the relatedness of a selection of the descriptors to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> was investigated. Six comfort factors could be distinguished (functionality, posture and muscles, irritation and pain of hand and fingers, irritation of hand surface, handle characteristics, aesthetics). These six factors can be classified into three meaningful groups: functionality, physical interaction and appearance. The main conclusions were that (1) the same descriptors were related to comfort and discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> (2) descriptors of functionality are most related to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> followed by descriptors of physical interaction and (3) descriptors of appearance become secondary in comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} same factors {{underlie}} comfort in using {{different kinds of}} <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> (screwdrivers, paintbrushes and handsaws). The underlying factors of the <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> are identified using principal components analysis. The relationships between comfort descriptors (i. e. statements in end-users' own words {{that are related to}} comfort) and comfort factors (i. e. groups of comfort descriptors) with comfort experience are calculated. It is concluded that the same factors (functionality, physical interaction adverse effects on skin and in soft tissues) underlie comfort in different kinds of <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> however their relative importance differed. Functionality and physical interaction are the most important factors of comfort in using screwdrivers and paintbrushes (beta 0. 73 and 0. 67, respectively) and functionality was {{the most important factor in}} using handsaws (beta 0. 72). Moreover, the most important comfort descriptors differ between different kinds of <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> 'Has a nice feeling handle' (beta 0. 27), 'fits the hand' (beta 0. 43) and 'offers a high task performance' (beta 0. 43) are the most important comfort descriptors in using screwdrivers, paintbrushes and handsaws, respectively. Moreover, similarities are seen: 'Fits the hand' is associated with comfort in all studied <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> The results are applied in a flow chart, which designers can use to address the appropriate comfort descriptors in the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> design process. © 2006 Elsevier B.
