5000|$|Upon release, Enter the Gungeon {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{and holds}} a Metacritic score of 84/100 for PC {{and one of}} 82/100 for PlayStation 4. Jed Whitaker of Destructoid rated the game 9.5/10, with praise that the repetitive entering of Gungeon [...] "never quite feels all that repetitious", however stating that [...] "the only part of Gungeon that will surely turn off some people is the difficulty." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly Spencer Campbell summarizes the game as [...] "overwhelming", giving it a score of 9.0/10, however, also decries the difficulty to be too high by saying [...] "Even though {{there were a few}} times that I yearned [...] for an easier difficulty ..., Enter the Gungeon difficulty is actually one of the game's strong points." [...] Vince Ingenito from IGN regards the large variety of guns in the game to be especially pleasing, but stating that a few guns are not very original or plain boring, rating the game 8.5/10. For Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair gave Enter the Gungeon a score of 4.5/5, highlighting the game's [...] "terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world", naming it to be [...] "an absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall". The Escapist Joshua Vanderwall gave the game 3.5/5 stars, criticizing that [...] "the difficulty often comes from the game refusing to provide you the necessary tools", also stating that [...] "the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> reasonable at first, but there are regular spikes that less proficient players will find incredibly frustrating".|$|E

By the end of Chapter 2, you will have learned that electromagnetism employs a vector quantity called the potential (one component is measured in the familiar unit of volts).

40|$|The {{design and}} {{animation}} of digital 3 D models {{is an essential}} task for many applications in science, engineering, education, medicine and arts. In many instances only an approximate representation is required and a simple and intuitive modelling and animation process, suitable for untrained users, {{is more important than}} realism and extensive features. Sketch-based modelling {{has been shown to be}} a suitable interface because the underlying pen-and-paper metaphor is intuitive and effective. In this paper we present LifeSketch, a framework for sketched-based modelling and animation. Threedimensional models are created with a variation of the popular “Teddy ” algorithm. The models are analysed and skeletons with joints are extracted fully automatically. The surface mesh is bound to the curved skeletons using skinning techniques and the resulting model can be animated using skeletal animation methods. The results of our evaluation and user study suggest that modelling and animation tasks are considerable more efficient than with traditional tools. The <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> flat and a half page document was sufficient to familiarise users with the tools functionality. Users were satisfied with the automatically extracted joints, but some users struggled selecting the appropriate rotation axes and angles for animating the resulting 3 D objects.

40|$|Formal {{verification}} {{techniques can}} be classified into two categories: deductive theorem proving and symbolic state enumeration. Each method has complementary advantages and disadvantages. In general, theorem provers are high reliability systems. They {{can be applied to}} the expressive formalisms that are capable of modelling complex designs such as processors. However, theorem provers use a glass-box approach. To complete a verification, it is necessary to understand the internal structure in detail. The <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> steep and modeling and verifying a system is very time-consuming. In contrast, symbolic state enumeration tools use a black-box approach. When verifying a design, the user does not need to understand its internal structure. Their advantages are their speed and ease of use. But they can only be used to prove relatively simple designs and the system security is much lower than the theorem proving system. Many hybrid tools have been developed to reap the benefits of both theorem proving Systems and symbolic state enumeration Systems. Normally, the verification results from one system are translated to another system. In other words, there is a linkage between the two Systems. However, how can we ensure that this linkage can be trusted? How can we ensure the verification system itself is correct? The contribution of this thesis is that we have produced a methodology which can provide a formal linkage between a symbolic state enumeration system and a theorem proving system based on a verified symbolic state enumeration system. The methodology has been partly realized in two simplified versions of the MDG system (a symbolic state enumeration system) and the HOL system (a theorem proving system) which involves the following three steps. First, we have verified aspects of correctness of two simplified versions of the MDG system. We have made certain that the semantics of a program is preserved in those of its translated form. Secondly, we have provided a formal linkage between the MDG system and the HOL system based on importing theorems. The MDG verification results can be formally imported into HOL to form the HOL theorems. Thirdly, we have combined the translator correctness theorems with the importing theorems. This combination allows the low level MDG verification results to be imported into HOL in terms of the semantics of a high level language (MDG-HDL). We have also summarized a general method which is used to prove the existential theorem for the specification and implementation of the design. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in a case study: the verification of the correctness and usability theorems of a vending machine...|$|E

40|$|Stenting Aortic Coarctation and Recoarctation. Immediate Results, Short and Mid-term Follow-up José Alonso, Alberto Sciegata, Luis Jmelnitsky, Horacio Faella The use of stents for the {{treatment}} of aortic coarctation and recoarctation is a recently developed therapeutic modality. We would like to communicate our immediate results, complications and mid term follow-up. During a 7 year period, we performed stent angioplasty in 47 patients with a diagnosis of aortic coarctation, 37 of which were native and 10 were re-coactations. Patients' mean age was 13 (6 to 37) years and mean weight was 46 (24 to 75) Kg. All procedures were performed percutaneously through the femoral artery and performed under general anesthesia. Fifty-one stents were implanted; conventional catheter balloons in 21 patients and balloon in balloon catheters (BIB) in the remaining 26. Thirty one Palmaz stents were implanted (17 P 4014, 10 P 308, 5 P 5014) and 20 CP stents (8 zigs x 39 mm: 11. 8 zigs × 34 mm: 6. 8 zigs × 55 mm: 1. 8 zigs × 28 mm : 1 and 8 zigs × 22 mm: Four of them were covered CP stent. Gradient reduction from a mean of 33 ± 17 mmHg (10 - 84 mmHg) to 0 ± 5. 16 mmHg (0 - 30 mmHg) (p< 0. 001) and an increase in diameter at the coarctation site from x: 5. 5 ± 2. 7 mm (1. 7 - 12. 2 mm) to x: 15 ± 3. 2 mm (5. 2 - 18. 3 mm) (p< 0. 001) was achieved. There were 3 major complications, 2 cerebrovascular accidents and 1 rupture of the femoral artery which needed surgical repair and 8 minor complications: 2 bleedings at the access site, 3 transient systemic hypertension, 2 diminished pulse and 1 transient cerebrovascular accident with full recovery. We had 2 conventional balloon ruptures. Three patients had wrong positioning of the stent, 2 of them underwent a second stenting in proper position, one of them currently under follow-up. Another 2 had late distal migration and underwent a new procedure with correct stenting. All the balloon ruptures and wrong positioning occurred with conventional balloons. During the mid-term follow up, between 1 month and 6. 8 years (mean 3. 8 years), we lost track of 15 patients and the rest were evaluated clinically, by X-rays, echocardiographically, by pressurometry and in selected patients by means of CT scan. Two patients were re-dilated and another 2 are waiting for a new angioplasty with high pressure balloons. Nine patients had previous antihypertensive treatment, which could be discontinued in 5. We conclude that stenting in native and postsurgical coarctation of the aorta is an effective and safe procedure. The morbidity of the method is progressively diminishing with the development of better and new specific materials, like BIB balloons and CP stents.
