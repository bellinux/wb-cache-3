30|$|A <b>Lambert</b> <b>shading</b> {{material}} {{was assigned to}} the polygonal plane. The type of material selected does not affect the displacement mapping. A new 2 D file texture node was created and connected to the Lambert Material as a displacement map attribute. The file node allows the importation of an image into Maya. A filter type can be chosen for the image, which will affect the quality of the image. However, it will also {{have an effect on the}} 3 D geometry shape when the image is converted into a 3 D object. For the SEM image the Gaussian filter was selected. The filter will give the best image quality, resulting in a smooth 3 D model. It did not affect the main features of the object.|$|E
