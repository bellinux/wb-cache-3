50|$|The Standard of the President of Ukraine is {{a square}} royal blue banner, {{featuring}} a tryzub, bordered by gold ornament and external {{fringe of the}} same colour. The staff is wooden with a round onyx top decorated with an embossed <b>lay-on</b> yellow ornament.|$|E
50|$|Stilts {{are often}} {{required}} to plaster most ceilings {{and it is}} typically harder to <b>lay-on</b> and work than walls. For short ceilings one can also work with milk crates. The difficulty of working upside down often results in plaster bombs splattering on the floors, walls and people below.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lay-on</b> and mix is {{the same}} as with regular texturing. however after a uniform and smooth coat is placed on the ceiling and the edges are cut in; a special {{rectangular}} sponge with a handle is run across the ceiling in overlapping and circular motions. This takes some skill and practice to do well.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{then keep}} an older trowel {{that has a}} decent bend in it (banana curve) {{to be used for}} the purpose of [...] "texturing"; if called for by the homeowner. A <b>lay-on</b> trowel tends to be too flat for this and the vacuum caused by the water can stick it to the wall, forcing him to tear it off and thus he has to rework the area.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the plaster}} {{is on the}} wall and starts to set (this can be {{determined}} by the table that sets first), the plasterer gingerly sprinkles water onto the wall; this helps to stall the setting and to create a slip. He then uses his trowel and often a wetted felt brush held in the opposite hand and lightly touching the wall ahead of the trowel to work this slip into any small gaps (known as [...] "catfaces") in the plaster as well as smooth out the rough <b>lay-on</b> and flatten any air bubbles that formed during setting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lay-on</b> {{phase is}} the same as smooth but it is added with a thicker coat. Once the coat is on uniformly the {{plasterer}} then goes back and birds his corners. Staying away from the corner he then gets a trowel with a nice banana curve in it and starts to run it over the wall in a figure eight or Ess pattern, making sure to cross all areas at least once. He adds a little extra plaster to his trowel if needed. The overall effect is layers of paint-like swaths over the whole of the ceiling or wall. He can then just walk away and let it set with care taken not too leave any globs and to make sure the corners look smooth and linear.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a {{development of a}} mathematical model for a <b>lay-on</b> instrument capacitor that takes into account an actual electrode thickness. Validity check of the mathematical model has been carried out in the paper. The paper contains quantitative evaluations and recommendations on design optimization of the <b>lay-on</b> instrument capacitor. </p...|$|E
