40|$|Reliance on {{carbohydrates}} during {{flower forcing}} {{was investigated in}} one early and one late flowering cultivar of azalea (Rhododendron simsii hybrids). Carbohydrate accumulation, invertase activity, and expression of a purported sucrose synthase gene (RsSUS) was monitored during flower forcing under suboptimal (natural) and optimal (supplemental <b>light)</b> <b>light</b> <b>conditions,</b> after a cold treatment (7 °C + dark) to break flower bud dormancy. Post-production sucrose metabolism and flowering quality was also assessed. Glucose and fructose concentrations and invertase activity increased in petals during flowering, while sucrose decreased. In suboptimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> RsSUS expression in leaves increased as compared to optimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions,</b> indicating that plants in suboptimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> have a strong demand for carbohydrates. However, carbohydrates in leaves were markedly lower in suboptimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to optimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> This resulted in poor flowering of plants in suboptimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> Post-production flowering relied on the stored leaf carbon, which could be accumulated under optimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> in the greenhouse. These results show that flower opening in azalea relies on carbohydrates imported from leaves and is source-limiting under suboptimal <b>light</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

2500|$|At 21:04 (UTC+3), on 8 June 2016, two {{perpetrators}} {{dressed in}} suits and ties {{arrived at the}} Max Brenner Cafe in the Sarona Market complex near HaArba'a Street in Tel Aviv. They inspected the area and then sat down on chairs outside, ordering desserts. At 21:27 the perpetrators stood up and fired at the diners until one of the perpetrators' firearms jammed. He slammed the firearm {{on the floor and}} the perpetrators started to run away from the site. The perpetrators wounded 11 people. Four were critically wounded, and later succumbed to their wounds. Two others were in severe condition, two in moderate condition and four in <b>light</b> <b>condition.</b> An additional 14 people suffering from symptoms of anxiety received medical attention at the scene and at the hospitals. The two did not have an escape plan, an official of the Israel Security Agency said, after investigation, that they [...] "trusted in Allah". The perpetrators fled and split up, and at 21:40, one of the perpetrators was wounded and neutralized after a gunfight with a civil guard of Kol Yisrael and was taken to Ichilov Hospital in serious condition. The other unarmed perpetrator ran in a nearby street, near the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. He encountered an off-duty policeman (who was in plainclothes) and asked him for a glass of water and the unsuspecting policeman invited him into his home with his family. The man then rushed {{to the scene of the}} attack, leaving the perpetrator in his home. The family tried to speak to the perpetrator but he didn't respond and was stressed. The wife of the policeman said she didn't suspect anything and that she thought he was a man who ran from the attack. When the policeman saw the other perpetrator was dressed just like the man he invited into his home, he rushed back to his home and captured the perpetrator who tried to escape. While arresting him, one of the policemen called in to help entered the home with his weapon drawn. When he saw that the perpetrator was already captured, he returned his weapon to its sheath, at which point it discharged a bullet and one of the policemen was wounded from shrapnel.|$|E

40|$|We discuss tting a semiparametric model {{based on}} two sources of information, which is {{motivated}} by a rat sleep dataset. In a recent study, rats were exposed to two dierent <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The rst, baseline condition, was a standard 24 -hour schedule of 12 hours lights on followed by 12 hours lights o; the second, test condition, exposed rats to a continuous 3 hours lights on / 3 hours lights o schedule. Rat sleep {{was believed to be}} aected mainly by the circadian rhythm under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition</b> and by both the circadian rhythm and light under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> In this article, we suggest tting a nonparametric model for the dataset under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> For the dataset under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> a two-part model is suggested. The rst part equals an unknown coecient multiplied by the nonparametric function used for modeling the dataset under the baseline <b>lighting</b> <b>condition,</b> explaining the remnant of the circadian rhythm under the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> The second part is a periodic nonparametric function which would explain the eect of the test <b>lighting</b> <b>condition.</b> This modeling procedure can be used to model other physiological parameters aected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

40|$|Images of {{the same}} face viewed under {{different}} <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> look different. It {{is no surprise then}} that face recognition systems based on image comparisons can fail when the <b>lighting</b> <b>conditions</b> vary.

40|$|Phytochrome {{interacting}} factors (PIFs) are nuclear basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription {{factors that}} negatively regulate photomorphogenesis {{both in the}} dark and in the light in Arabidopsis. The phytochrome (phy) family of photoreceptors induces the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of PIFs in response to both red and far-red <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> to promote photomorphogenesis. Although phys have been shown to function under blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions,</b> the roles of PIFs under blue light have not been investigated in detail. Here we show that PIF 1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis at the seedling stage under blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> pif 1 seedlings displayed more open cotyledons and slightly reduced hypocotyl length compared to wild type under diurnal (12 hr light/ 12 hr dark) blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> Double-mutant analyses demonstrated that pif 1 phyA, pif 1 phyB, pif 1 cry 1, and pif 1 cry 2 have enhanced cotyledon opening compared to the single photoreceptor mutants under diurnal blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> Blue <b>light</b> induced the rapid phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and degradation of PIF 1 through the ubi/ 26 S proteasomal pathway. PIF 1 interacted with phyA and phyB in a blue light-dependent manner, and the interactions with phys are necessary for the blue light-induced degradation of PIF 1. phyA played a dominant role under pulses of blue light, while phyA, phyB, and phyD induced the degradation of PIF 1 in an additive manner under prolonged continuous blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> Interestingly, the absence of cry 1 and cry 2 enhanced the degradation of PIF 1 under blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions.</b> Taken together, these data suggest that PIF 1 functions as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under blue <b>light</b> <b>conditions</b> and that blue light-activated phys induce the degradation of PIF 1 through the ubi/ 26 S proteasomal pathway to promote photomorphogenesis...|$|R

He first developed a model of all-night suppression of melatonin by all-night bright light. He then established a successful exogenous melatonin infusion protocol that replicated endogenous melatonin levels in the bright-light conditions. All-night bright-light suppression of melatonin suppressed the normal trough of body temperature seen between 3-4 a.m., the time of maximum melatonin levels. Exogenous infusion of melatonin, replicating endogenous levels, in the bright <b>light</b> <b>condition</b> (in which endogenous melatonin was suppressed) reestablished the normal trough of core body temperature.
