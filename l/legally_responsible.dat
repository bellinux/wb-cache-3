5|$|Perceval {{had led the}} Tory {{government}} since 1809, during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, {{when he had been}} imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, and apparent certainty that his action was justified, raised questions about his sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be <b>legally</b> <b>responsible</b> for his actions.|$|E
5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or <b>legally</b> <b>responsible</b> for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E

50|$|Flight dispatchers are <b>legally</b> 50% <b>responsible</b> for {{the safety}} of every flight they dispatch. The pilot in command of the flight holds {{responsibility}} for the other 50%. A flight dispatcher has the legal authority to refuse to dispatch a flight if safety is in any way in question, as does the pilot in command. This is known as 'Co-Authority Dispatch'. Because commercial decision making in an airline can conflict with the safety of a flight, a flight dispatcher's responsibilities are kept separate from the commercial aspects of an airline's operation, and as such the profession is primarily focused on the safety of a flight; all other duties are secondary.|$|R

The Act states that food-producing or retailing corporations cannot be <b>legally</b> held <b>responsible</b> for obesity, heart disease, or other health-related issues caused by consumption of their food, save for situations where actual food quality or handling was held responsible for such issues.|$|R

5000|$|It is now {{generally}} {{settled in}} caselaw that jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada {{have the right}} to enact breed-specific legislation. Despite these holdings by the courts, there is some public skepticism over whether the laws are effective.

Another point of view is that comprehensive [...] "dog bite" [...] legislation, coupled with better consumer education and <b>legally</b> mandating <b>responsible</b> pet-keeping practices, is a better {{solution to the problem of}} dangerous pit bulls than BSL.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the Arkansas Adoption Act through five different perspectives. It first reviews {{the history of the}} Act and places it in proper context. The Act is then compared to adoption laws throughout the United States and how they treat same-sex and other unmarried couples. The article then reviews the stances taken around the globe with regards to adoption. The policy and legal arguments for and against adoption by same-sex and other unmarried couples are examined, and then the social science evidence is reviewed. The article concludes that prohibiting adoption by all cohabiting couples, regardless of sexual orientation, is a socially <b>responsible,</b> <b>legally</b> well-accepted, and scientifically well-justified public policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{commentary}} is not {{to examine}} Thimbleby’s criticisms of the general state of software, but to question his suggested solutions to this problem. Thimbleby proposes two remedies: that software manufacturers be made <b>legally</b> and financially <b>responsible</b> for any loss or damage that arises {{as a result of}} any dysfunction of their software, and that these manufacturers employ formal methods as a means of ensuring the consistency and quality of their products. Although these proposals might appear eminently reasonable, it is suggested that these issues are more complex than they first appear, and that the remedies proposed by Thimbleby have a number of shortcomings...|$|R

50|$|Under section 75 of the United Kingdom's Consumer Credit Act, {{credit card}} {{companies}} are required to refund payments made by customers who failed to receive goods or services if the purchase was made directly from the retailer. Purchases made through online payment services such as Nochex involve three parties—the consumer pays the online payment service for credits or e-money, and the online payment service makes the purchase for the consumer from the retailer. The online payment service is thus <b>legally</b> only <b>responsible</b> for handling the transaction, and not for resolving disputes or providing refunds. Some online payment services do in fact provide refunds {{in the case of}} disputes, but Nochex has been cited as a company that does not honor such requests. Nochex, for its part, has asserted that it attempts to verify the credentials of its customers, and instructs consumers to attempt to settle any disputes by contacting the retailer directly or by reporting the problem to law enforcement. The Office of Fair Trading has stated that the current law is unclear and they intend to pursue changes that will provide consumers with additional protections.|$|R
40|$|This paper discursively {{analyses}} advocates' {{explanations of}} asylum seeking in the 2001 Australian parliamentary debates. Previous research has mapped the negative discourses used to present asylum seekers as economic migrants 'taking advantage' of soft laws. This paper analyses how advocates oppose this rhetoric, re-categorising asylum seekers as potential refugees, and establishing Australia as <b>legally</b> and morally <b>responsible</b> for providing protection. This paper examines three influences shaping advocates' arguments: opposing anti-asylum seeker rhetoric; {{theories of the}} formation of anti-asylum seeker public opinion; and the parliamentary and wider liberal democratic intellectual political framework. It then analyses four extracts taken from political speeches in the parliament, focussing on the rhetorical strategies used to counter a pervasive 'culture of disbelief' against asylum seekers.

50|$|In October 2010, Westminster City Council, Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, and Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council {{planned to}} {{combining}} {{specific areas of}} service delivery {{as a response to}} financial pressures facing local government in England. In February 2011 the chief executives of the three local authorities published a report entitled Bold Ideas for Challenging Times. This set out the plan to share services, combine back office and management costs, and gave a projected saving of £33.4m. The report outlined that in June 2011, the three authorities would, together detail how they would deliver the proposals. The cabinets for each authority then met separately and agreed to implement the proposals to share services. Under the plan the councils would remain <b>legally</b> distinct entities <b>responsible</b> for service specification and delivery.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{generally}} settled in case law that jurisdictions in the United States and Canada {{have the right}} to enact breed-specific legislation; however, the appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog bite fatalities and injuries is disputed. One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive [...] "dog bite" [...] legislation, coupled with better consumer education and <b>legally</b> mandating <b>responsible</b> pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs. A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places. Finally, some governments, such as that of Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the population slowly through natural attrition.|$|R
40|$|In Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein (1831), protagonist Victor Frankenstein and his {{relationship}} to the creature have often been characterized in terms of creator and creation, with Victor trying to usurp women's procreative role or trying to become God through scientifically giving life. Although Victor can be rightly understood as a mother or a creator, {{he also has a}} distinct relationship to the creature as a father because of his position in society as a man. Victor, however, fails in his role as father to the creature, which creates new implications for {{his relationship}} with the creature. In addition to abandoning his creation, we might say Victor abandons his child. Instead of condemning Victor for creating the creature, we can identify his chief failure as refusing to be a father to the creature, including failing to be <b>legally</b> and morally <b>responsible</b> to him...|$|R
