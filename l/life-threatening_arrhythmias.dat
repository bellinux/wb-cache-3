50|$|Arrhythmia {{termination}} involves {{stopping a}} <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> {{once it has}} already occurred. One effective form of arrhythmia termination in individuals with LQTS is placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

2500|$|Abnormalities in {{conduction}} and repolarization of {{the heart}} that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation, increased QT dispersion, conduction delays, [...] and junctional escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity {{of the heart}}, and result in <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. [...] Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, {{a reduction in the}} ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size normalizes over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{objectives}} are to prevent <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> or conduction disturbances. This requires monitoring in a {{coronary care unit}} and protocolised administration of antiarrhythmic agents. Antiarrhythmic agents are typically only given to individuals with <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> after a myocardial infarction and not to suppress the ventricular ectopy that is often seen after a myocardial infarction.|$|E

We encountered a patient who had recovered from ventricular fibrillation treated by using an AED, and silent coronary artery spasm was considered to be the cause of this <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> In this case, I- 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was a useful screening tool for a si-lent coronary artery spasm.

40|$|Ventricular {{tachycardia}} or fibrillation (VT) as fatal cardiac arrhythmias are {{the main}} factors triggering sudden cardiac death. The objective of this investigation is to find early signs of sustained VT in patients with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). These devices are able to safeguard patients by returning their hearts to a normal rhythm via strong defibrillatory shocks; additionally, {{they are able to}} store at least 1000 beat-to-beat intervals immediately before the onset of a <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> We study these 1000 beat-to-beat intervals of 63 chronic heart failure ICD patients before the onset of a <b>life-threatening</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> and at a control time, i. e. without VT event. To characterize these rather short data sets, we calculate heart rate variability (HRV) parameters from time and frequency domain, from symbolic dynamics as well as the finite-time growth rates. We find that no linear parameter shows significant differences in HRV between the VT and the control time series. However, the nonlinear parameters detected a significant increase in short phases with low variability before the onset of VT (p< 0. 05, for time series with less than 10 % ectopy). Finally, we are investigating whether these results may lead to individual predictions of VT...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on <b>life-threatening</b> {{ventricular}} <b>arrhythmia</b> in patients with heart failure (HF) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Background: It is thought that OSA is associated with cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of OSA increases the risk of <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmia</b> in patients with HF. Methods: We prospectively studied 71 consecutive HF patients who were followed for 180 days after a sleep study. All patients had an ICD for primary or secondary prevention. Baseline clinical characteristics and the frequency of appropriate ICD therapy for <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmia</b> were compared between patients with and without OSA. Results: OSA was diagnosed in 51 % of 71 patients. There were no statistical differences between patients with and without OSA in baseline cardiac functions. However, during follow-up, appropriate ICD therapies occurred more frequently in patients with OSA (42 %) than in those without OSA (17 %, p= 0. 041). On multivariate analysis, the presence of OSA was an independent predictor for appropriate ICD therapy (HR 3. 58, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 13. 3, p= 0. 045). Conclusions: In patients with HF, the presence of OSA was an independent predictor for <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryVasospastic angina is a {{frequent}} and well-recognized pathology with {{a high risk of}} <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis of vasospastic angina requires the combination of clinical and electrocardiographic variables and the results of provocation tests, such as ergonovine administration. Smoking cessation {{is the first step in}} the management of vasospastic angina. Optimal medical treatment using calcium-channel blockers and/or nitrate derivatives can provide protection, but <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> may occur despite optimal medical treatment and several years after the start of treatment. In this review, we evaluate the role of implantable defibrillators as a complement to optimal medical management in patients with <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> due to vasospastic angina; this role is not well characterized in the literature or guidelines. We discuss the role of implantable defibrillators in secondary prevention in light of three recent cases managed in our departments and a review of the literature. An implantable defibrillator was implanted in two of the three cases of vasospastic angina with ventricular arrhythmias that we managed. We considered secondary prevention by implantable defibrillator to be justified even in the absence of any obvious risk factor. Ventricular arrhythmias recurred during implantable defibrillator follow-up in the two patients implanted. ConclusionIn patients with <b>life-threatening</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmias</b> due to vasospastic angina, an implantable defibrillator should be considered because of the risk of recurrence despite optimal medical management...|$|R
