Despite the growing awareness of environmental and safety impacts of fuel transfer, such as emissions, spills and other harmful effects, existing energy models for various types of networks are yet to fully capture modal distinctions which are relevant to providing pathways to limiting these impacts. To address this deficit in detailed multimodal analyses, we have built on recent work to develop a partial-equilibrium model that incorporates the representation of multimodal fuel transfer within energy networks.

40|$|In {{northern}} {{parts of}} North America, the road network is weakened and extensively {{damaged by the}} seasonal loading. The yearly cycle of above and below freezing temperatures causes cycles of freezing and thawing of the groundwater underneath the pavement. As the groundwater freezes, the pavement undergoes uplift, while as the temperature rises to above freezing, the frozen ground thaws. As the pavement thaws from the surface down, the soil eventually becomes saturated as the water becomes trapped between the pavement surface and the frozen soil. The pavement is in a weakened state during this saturated period, which can last up to several weeks every year. Most authorities have opted to impose <b>load</b> <b>restrictions</b> on vehicles during this thawing period. Yet, since the pavement temperature tends to lag behind the air temperature, {{it is difficult to}} determine the exact time duration that the pavement is in this weakened state. An accurate time for imposing the <b>load</b> <b>restriction</b> is required since delayed restrictions will cause pavement damage, whereas premature <b>load</b> <b>restrictions</b> will cause undue economic hardship on industries that require transportation of their goods.

Phosphorous <b>loading</b> <b>restrictions</b> implemented throughout the Great Lakes region in the 1970 ’s were successful in reducing the standing crop levels of Cladophora. Since the early 2000 ’s there has been a resurgence of Cladophora growth in near-shore Lake Michigan. This resurgence has been attributed to the activities of the invasive species of mussels known as Dreissena rostriformis burgensis, which was first discovered in Lake Michigan in 1998. This paper builds on the Great Lakes Cladophora Model developed by Tomlinson et. al. in 2010; and explicitly takes into account the feeding activity of the mussel population which supplies phosphorus to the benthic region that stimulates Cladophora growth. The new model demonstrates good agreement between simulation and measured data for Cladophora biomass during a growing season. The mechanistic model is used to provide a quantitative analysis of the contribution of and sensitivity to key environmental factors in Cladophora biomass.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Ship {{turnaround}} {{time at a}} marine containerport is an important measure of the port's efficiency and attractiveness. Both the speed and quality of load planning affect the length of {{turnaround time}} considerably. Past attempts at computerizing the load planning function have been unsatisfactory and have not reflected the port's objective of optimally utilizing its facilities and equipment. The computerized model developed through this study generates optimum feasible load plans that minimize yard material handling of containers while meeting all ship stability and <b>loading</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The model is particularly addressed to containerports with transtainers as prime yard movers. Minimization of yard handling is accomplished through formulation of the transtainer routing problem as a dynamic programming problem. The set of shipboard container-cell assignments is then checked against the constraints. Pairwise exchanges of assignments are made to meet any violated constraint so that the yard handling increase is minimized. The model has been tested using data for five actual ship loadings at Port of Portland. It yielded feasible load plans that were better than those manually generated showing an average 3. 2 percent less material handling requirements. The model can be easily implemented at containerports with medium-to-large computers with some adjustments. The success of this study not only provides a way of increasing port productivity, but also makes available an important software component for a port automation system...|$|E

The results are theoretically plausible and in line with other findings in the literature. The first part of this paper uses quantitative methods to assess the success of party affiliation, personal interests and the economic profile of the constituencies in predicting voting behavior. Thanks to the detailed censuses of 1846 on agriculture, industry and population, it is possible to typify the economic make-up of the electoral districts in much more detail than in the British case. However, the analysis of roll-call voting proves that party affiliation and personal and constituency economic interests are insufficient to explain the shift towards free trade. The second part of the paper then discusses the role played by political strategy and ideas in the liberalization of corn tariffs, using a qualitative analysis of the debates on tariff policy. The large number of votes over a forty year period allows us to document the relationship between ideas and interests in a new way.

40|$|The annual {{production}} of biosolids in the Perth region {{during the period}} of this study was approximately 13, 800 t dry solids (DS), being supplied by three major wastewater treatment plants. Of this, 70 % was typically used as a low-grade fertiliser in agriculture, representing an annual land use area of around 1, 600 ha when spread between 5 and 7 t DS/ha. Loading rates of biosolids are typically based on the nitrogen (N) requirements of the crop to be grown, referred to as the N Limiting Biosolids Application Rate (NLBAR). A consequence of using the NLBAR to calculate loading rates is that phosphorus (P) is typically in excess of plant requirement. The resultant high loading rates of P are considered in the guidelines developed for the agricultural use of biosolids in Western Australia, but lack research data specific to local conditions and soil types. Regulatory changes throughout Australia and globally to protect the environment from wastewater pollution have created a need for more accountable and balanced nutrient data. Experiments presented in this thesis were undertaken to ascertain: the percentage relative effectiveness (RE) of biosolids as a source of plant available P compared with inorganic P fertiliser; loading rates to best supply P for optimum crop growth; P loading rates of risk to the environment; and the forms of P in local biosolids. Therefore, both the agronomic and environmental viewpoints were considered. Anaerobically digested and dewatered biosolids produced from Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant, Perth with a mean total P content of 2. 97 % dry weight basis (db) were used in a series of glasshouse, field and laboratory experiments. The biosolids were sequentially fractionated to identify the forms of P present and likewise in soil samples after applying biosolids or monocalcium phosphate (MCP). The biosolid P was predominantly inorganic (92 %), and hence the organic fraction (8 %) available for mineralisation at all times would be extremely low. The most common forms of biosolid P were water-soluble P and exchangeable inorganic P (66 %), followed by bicarbonate extractable P (19 %) and the remaining P as inorganic forms associated with Fe, Al and Ca (14 %). Following the application of biosolids to a lateritic soil, the Fe and Al soil fractions sorbed large amounts of P, not unlike the distribution of P following the addition of MCP. Further investigation would be required to trace the cycling of biosolid P in the various soil pools. The growth response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to increasing rates of biosolids and comparable rates of inorganic P as MCP, to a maximum of 150 mg P/kg soil was examined in the glasshouse. The percentage relative effectiveness (RE) of biosolids was calculated using fitted curve coefficients from the Mitscherlich equation: y = a (1 -b exp–cx) for dry matter (DM) production and P uptake. The initial effectiveness of biosolid P was comparable to that of MCP with the percentage RE of biosolids averaging 106 % for DM {{production of}} wheat shoots and 118 % for shoot P uptake at 33 days after sowing (DAS) over three consecutive crops. The percentage residual value (RV) declined at similar rates for DM production in MCP and biosolids, decreasing to about 33 % relative to freshly applied MCP in the second crop and to approximately 16 % in the third crop. The effectiveness of biosolid P was reduced significantly compared with inorganic P when applied to a field site 80 km east of Perth (520 mm annual rainfall). An infertile lateritic podsolic soil, consistent with the glasshouse experiment and representative of a soil type typically used for the agricultural application of biosolids in Western Australia was used. Increasing rates of biosolids and comparable rates of triple superphosphate (TSP), to a maximum of 145 kg P/ha were applied to determine a P response curve. The percentage RE was calculated for seasonal DM production, final grain yield and P uptake in wheat followed by lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) rotation for the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons, respectively. In the first year of wheat, the RE for P uptake in biosolids compared with top-dressed TSP ranged from 33 % to 55 % over the season and by grain harvest was 67 %. In the second year, and following incorporation with the disc plough at seeding, the RE for P uptake by lupins in biosolids averaged 79 % over the growing season compared with top-dressed TSP, and by grain harvest the RE was 60 %. The residual value (RV) of lupins at harvest in biosolids compared with freshly applied TSP was 47 %. The non-uniform placement of biosolids (i. e. spatial heterogeneity) was primarily responsible for the decreased ability of plant roots to absorb P. The P was more effective where biosolids were finely dispersed throughout the soil, less so when roughly cultivated and least effective when placed on the soil surface without incorporation. The RE for grain harvest of wheat in the field decreased from 67 % to 39 % where biosolids were not incorporated (i. e. surface-applied). The RE could also be modified by factors such as soil moisture and N availability in the field, although it was possible to keep these variables constant in the glasshouse. Consequently, absolute values determined for the RE need to be treated judiciously. Calculations showed that typical loading rates of biosolids required to satisfy agronomic P requirements of wheat in Western Australia in the first season could vary from 0 to 8. 1 t DS/ha, depending on soil factors such as the P Retention Index (PRI) and bicarbonate available P value. Loading rates of biosolids were inadequate for optimum P uptake by wheat at 5 t DS/ha (i. e. 145 kg P/ha) based on the NLBAR on high P sorbing soils with a low fertiliser history (i. e. PRI > 15, Colwell bicarbonate extractable P 2 mm, and thus their was little relationship between soil bicarbonate extractable P and P uptake by plants in the field. The risk of P leaching in biosolids-amended soil was examined over a number of different soil types at comparable rates of P at 140 mg P/kg (as either biosolids or MCP) in a laboratory experiment. Given that biosolids are restricted on sites prone to water erosion, the study focussed on the movement of water-soluble P by leaching rather than by runoff of water-soluble P and particulate P. In general the percentage soluble reactive P recovered was lower in soils treated with biosolids than with MCP, as measured in leachate collected using a reverse soil leachate unit. This was particularly evident in acid washed sand with SRP measuring 14 % for biosolids and 71 % for MCP, respectively, although the differences were not as large in typical agricultural soils. Specific soil properties, such as the PRI, pH, organic carbon and reactive Fe content were negatively correlated to soluble reactive P in leachate and thus reduced the risk of P leaching in biosolids-amended soil. Conversely, the total P and bicarbonate extractable P status of the soils investigated were unreliable indicators as to the amount of P leached. On the basis of the experiments conducted, soils in Western Australia were categorised according to their ability to minimise P enrichment and provide P necessary for crop growth at loading rates determined by the NLBAR. Biosolids applied at the NLBAR to soils of PRI > 2 mL/g with reactive Fe > 200 mg/kg were unlikely to necessitate P <b>loading</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Although specific to anaerobically digested biosolids cake applied to Western Australian soils, the results will be of relevance to any industry involved in the land application of biosolids, to prevent P contamination in water bodies and to make better use of P in crop production...|$|E
