5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult <b>lamprey,</b> the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific <b>lamprey,</b> and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the <b>lamprey</b> and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>lampreys</b> (Petromyzontidae) are {{a family}} of <b>lampreys.</b> Northern <b>lampreys</b> have {{the highest number of}} chromosomes (164-174) among vertebrates.|$|R
25|$|In Britain, <b>lampreys</b> are {{commonly}} used as bait, normally as dead bait. Northern pike, perch, and chub all can be caught on <b>lampreys.</b> Frozen <b>lampreys</b> can be bought from most bait and tackle shops.|$|R
40|$|Mark-recapture studies {{indicated}} that a pulsed-DC electrical barrier set to a 2 -ms pulse width and 10 pulses/s completely blocked the spawning migration of sea <b>lampreys</b> Petromyzon marinus in the Jordan River, Michigan. Capture efficiency of fyke nets averaged 24 % for four groups, about 300 tagged sea <b>lampreys</b> each, released upstream of the barrier; no unmarked sea <b>lampreys</b> {{and none of the}} 1, 194 sea <b>lampreys</b> tagged and released downstream of the barrier were captured in the fyke nets while the barrier was energized. At a lower pulsator setting (1 -ms pulse width, 10 pulses/s), 1 of 900 sea <b>lampreys</b> released below the barrier was recaptured in the nets. Sea <b>lampreys</b> from downstream were captured in the fyke nets after the barrier was de-energized, indicating that the barrier should remain in operation later than mid-July. Both sea <b>lampreys</b> and teleosts exposed to the electrical field were stunned but exhibited no apparent damage at either barrier setting. The pulsed DC electrical barrier should help reduce the use of chemical lampricides for controlling sea <b>lampreys</b> in some Great Lakes streams and would be particularly suited for streams where even the smallest low-head barrier would create an unacceptably large impoundment...|$|R
5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and <b>lamprey,</b> as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and <b>lamprey,</b> and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific <b>lamprey,</b> and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, North American river otter, American mink, and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lampreys</b> {{have long}} been {{thought to be a}} {{cetacean}} ectoparasite, due to the observation of round marks on the skin of whales caught during whaling operations. Pike (1951), Nemoto (1955), and van Utrecht (1959) compared such marks on the skin of various cetacean species caught in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with the dentition of <b>lampreys</b> and concluded that most round marks had been caused by this parasite. However, <b>lampreys</b> were never collected from captured whales and, {{due to the lack of}} direct evidence, some discussion emerged as to the origin of these wounds. Jones (1971) later argued that crescent-shaped marks previously attributed to <b>lampreys</b> were in fact caused by cookie-cutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). However, he agreed that other round marks were undoubtedly caused by <b>lampreys.</b> Recently, photographs of sea <b>lampreys</b> (Petromyzon marinus) attached to northern right whales, Eubalaena glacialis (Nichols and Hamilton 2004), and minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (Nichols and Tscherter 2011), in the western North Atlantic conclusively showed that <b>lampreys</b> do associate with those species. Similar evidence for other cetaceans is still lacking...|$|R
25|$|The unique {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} <b>lampreys,</b> {{such as their}} cartilaginous skeleton, suggest they are the sister taxon (see cladistics) of all living jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and are usually considered the most basal group of the Vertebrata. Instead of true vertebrae, they {{have a series of}} cartilaginous structures called arcualia arranged above the notochord. Hagfish, which resemble <b>lampreys,</b> have traditionally been considered the sister taxon of the true vertebrates (<b>lampreys</b> and gnathostomes) but DNA evidence suggests that they are in fact the sister taxon of <b>lampreys.</b>|$|R
40|$|Between 15 {{days and}} 3 months in age, the 'elastica externa' of the {{notochord}} sheath of larval <b>lampreys</b> develops from patches of moderately dense and amorphous material into a thick, continuous and electron-dense layer. In both <b>lampreys</b> and hagfish, this layer stains strongly with Verhoeff's elastic stain and aldehyde fuchsin and is penetrated by collagen fibrils on both its outer and inner boundaries. Peroxidase labelling using an antibody raised against human elastin specifically labels both the notochord 'elastica externa' and the elastic fibre system of <b>lampreys.</b> The diameters of the microfibrils (10 - 13 nm) of the oxytalan, elaunin and elastic fibres of <b>lampreys</b> and hagfish {{are the same}} as those of higher vertebrates. The connective tissue immediately dorsal and ventral to the notochord of <b>lampreys</b> contains mainly oxytalan fibres in very young ammocoetes, a combination of oxytalan, elaunin and elastic fibres in older ammocoetes, and predominantly elastic fibres in adult <b>lampreys.</b> While the region of the endomeninx {{at the base of the}} spinal cord contains almost exclusively oxytalan fibres in young ammocoetes, it also possesses numerous elastic fibres in adult <b>lampreys.</b> These findings indicate that, as in higher vertebrates, the clastic fibres of <b>lampreys</b> develop from oxytalan fibres via claunin fibre...|$|R
5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific <b>Lamprey</b> are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The river {{supported}} species including chinook salmon, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific <b>lamprey.</b> It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the <b>lamprey</b> has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} <b>lampreys</b> and hagfish, however, have {{a simpler}} system. The inner ear in these species {{consists of a}} single vestibular chamber, although in <b>lampreys,</b> this {{is associated with a}} series of sacs lined by cilia. <b>Lampreys</b> have only two semicircular canals, with the horizontal canal being absent, while hagfish have only a single, vertical, canal.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} scheme groups hagfish and <b>lampreys</b> {{together as}} cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), {{as the oldest}} surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed vertebrates). The alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} <b>lampreys</b> than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include <b>lampreys</b> but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish.|$|R
50|$|Cephalaspidomorphs are a {{group of}} jawless fishes named for Cephalaspis of the osteostracans. Most {{biologists}} regard this taxon as extinct, but the name is sometimes used in the classification of <b>lampreys,</b> because <b>lampreys</b> were {{once thought to be}} related to cephalaspids. If <b>lampreys</b> are included, they would extend the known range of the group from the Silurian and Devonian periods to the present day.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, <b>lamprey,</b> and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific <b>lamprey</b> and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, <b>lamprey</b> and trout were common.|$|E

25|$|Invasive {{species are}} a problem for Lake Ontario, {{particularly}} <b>lamprey</b> and zebra mussels. <b>Lamprey</b> are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed.

25|$|Extant jawless {{fish are}} either <b>lamprey</b> or hagfish. Juvenile <b>lamprey</b> feed by sucking up mud {{containing}} micro-organisms and organic debris. The <b>lamprey</b> has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. The hagfish coats itself and carcasses it finds with noxious slime to deter predators, and periodically ties {{itself into a}} knot to scrape the slime off. It is the only invertebrate fish and the only animal which has a skull but no vertebral column. It has four hearts, two brains, and a paddle-like tail.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 38 known extant species of <b>lampreys.</b> Parasitic species {{are the best}} known, and feed by boring into the flesh of other fish to suck their blood; but only 18 species of <b>lampreys</b> are parasitic.

50|$|Sea <b>lampreys</b> parasitize other fishes {{for their}} diet, {{including}} elasmobranchs such as {{sharks and rays}} which have naturally high levels of urea in their blood. Urea is toxic to most fishes in high concentrations, and is usually excreted immediately. <b>Lampreys</b> are able to tolerate much higher concentrations than most other fish and excrete it at extremely high rates, obtained from ingested blood. Trimethylamine oxides present in ingested elasmobranch blood aid in counteracting the detrimental effects of high urea concentration in the <b>lamprey's</b> bloodstream as it feeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} factors on migratory activity of adult river <b>lampreys</b> entering the Kalajoki and Perhonjoki, rivers in Finland, for spawning was studied using correlation and regression analyses. Telemetric tracking of 60 individuals was utilized {{to study the}} migratory patterns and holding habitat requirements of adult river <b>lampreys.</b> The increases in the river discharge, wind forcing towards the river mouth and speed and magnitude of river water cooling had positive effects on the numbers of <b>lampreys</b> entering the rivers whereas {{the increase in the}} illumination intensity of the moon had a negative effect on their migration activity. Radio-tagged <b>lampreys</b> typically passed slow-flowing river sections as well as steep riffles during one night, and were holding in runs, glides and the lowermost section of riffles. Substratum dominated by large boulders (> 256 mm) was preferred during winter holding behaviour. The migratory activity of <b>lampreys</b> released in low (16 °C) river water temperatures was low. <b>Lampreys</b> tended to halt next to illuminated bridges, and we suggest that this behaviour markedly shortened migration distances. The passage efficiency through a natural-like fish ramp in the low-head barrier was 100 %. The results can be utilized in mitigation actions like river restoration, transplanting of adults, and improving passage and water flow regulation...|$|R
