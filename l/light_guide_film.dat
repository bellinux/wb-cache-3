Polymers poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyimide (PI) doped with organic laser dyes 4 -dicyanomethylene- 2 -methyl- 6 -p dimethylaminostyryl- 4 H pyran (DCM) and 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 - pentamethyl- 2, 6 -diethyl-pyrromethene -BF 2 -complex (Pyrommethene 567, PM- 567) were selected as materials for <b>light</b> <b>guiding</b> <b>films.</b> Additionally, UV polymerized polydiacetylene (PDA) on glass substrate was used as a waveguide material. Optical waveguides were fabricated using spin coating of preoxidized silicon wafers (1. 5 micrometer silicon oxide layer) with organic dye/polymer solution followed by soft baking. the modes in slab waveguides were studied using prism coupling techniques. Measured values of mode coupling angles in multimode waveguides were used to calculate film thickness and refractive index for different polarizations. Refractive index anisotropy was found in PDA waveguide. The optimal conditions of spin coating for single mode waveguide fabrication were estimated. Propagation losses were measured by collecting the light scattered from the trace of a propagating mode either by scanning photo detector or by CCD camera. Different types of light coupling techniques were used including end-dire coupling, prism and grating coupling. Mechanical printing technique was developed for coupling grating fabrication resulting in gratings with 4 % diffraction efficiency. The gratings demonstrated good stability with diffraction efficiency relaxation rate 2. 4 dB/hour at a temperature approximately 15 - 20 C below glass transition point. Dye doped waveguides were transversally pumped with frequency doubled Nd:YAG Q-switched laser producing intensive light emission with apparent 6 kW/sq cm pump threshold and spectrum narrowing near 617 nm peak in the case of DCM doped waveguide. PM- 567 doped waveguide pumped with CW Ar(+) laser (514 nm wavelength) far below threshold (0. 1 W/sq. cm pump power) demonstrated emission spectrum narrowing near 616 nm peak with 18 % power conversion slope efficiency. In this case emission spectrum modification was caused by the enhanced light absorption along the direction of propagating waveguide modes. Changing length, thickness, and other morphlogical waveguide parameters one can modify emission spectrum in predictable direction. The results show that polymeric waveguides, especially based on high temperature polymers such as Pl, can be used to produce a varietiy of active and passive silicon compatible integrated optical components for aerospace applications...|$|R

This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed <b>light</b> <b>guides,</b> the number of counts and the optimum amplifier shaping time. Two different methods used to fabricate <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their light output, energy resolution, and the optimum shaping time. Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution. The transmittance of light from the spectrometer through the 3 D Printed <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> was significantly poorer than that of the acrylic <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> The difference in recorded energy resolution between the <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> was not very significant.
