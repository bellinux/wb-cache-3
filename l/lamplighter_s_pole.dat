We use data acquired by the Mercury Laser Altimeter on the MESSENGER spacecraft during 11 months of orbital observations to revisit the depths of craters at high northern latitudes on Mercury. We measured the depth and diameter of 537 craters located poleward of 45 N, evaluated {{the slopes of the}} northern and southern walls of 30 PDCs, and assessed the floor roughness of 94 craters, including nine PDCs. We find that the PDCs appear to have a fresher crater morphology than the non-PDCs and that the radar-bright material has no detectable influence on crater depths, wall slopes, or floor roughness. The statistical similarity of crater depth-diameter relations for the PDC and non-PDC populations places an upper limit on the thickness of the radar-bright material (< 170 m for a crater 11 km in diameter) that can be refined by future detailed analysis. Results of the current study are consistent with the view that the radar-bright material constitutes a relatively thin layer emplaced preferentially in comparatively young craters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} wheel-type high-speed railway with a rotatable motor has a {{limit of}} 600 km/h speed. The normal conducting electromagnet has several disadvantages to realize 600 km/h speed. Several disadvantages are the increased space and weight, and the decreased electric efficiency to generate the required high magnetic field. In {{order to reduce the}} volume and weight, superconducting electromagnets can be considered for LSM (Linear Synchronous Motor). Prior to the fabrication of the real system, a prototype demo-coil is designed and fabricated using 2 G high temperature superconducting wire. The prototype HTS coil is cooled by the conduction using a GM cryocooler. To reduce the heat penetration, thermal design was performed for the current leads, supporting structure and radiation shield considering the thermal stress. The operating temperature and current are 30 ∼ 40 K and 100 A. The coil consists of two double pancake coils (N, <b>S</b> <b>pole,</b> respectively) and it is driven on a test rail, which is installed for the test car.

The y-axis of the coordinates was directed from the N <b>pole</b> to the <b>S</b> <b>pole</b> of the circuit, whereas the x-axis was parallel to the cylindrical axis of the vacuum chamber: The samples were expected to translate along the x-axis. The field distribution along the x-axis was measured prior to the experiment with a spatial division of 0.1 cm. The field intensity was equal to zero at a position of xR = 1.87 ± 0.05 cm, since the magnetic line of force turned from the [+y] to [−y] direction at this position. The experiment of magnetic ejection using the chamber-type μG generator was realized by the development of the small magnetic circuit. The initial sample position is defined as x 0 for each sample. The field intensity at x = x 0 is defined as B 0. According to the measured field distribution, the position of x 0 is in an area of negative field gradient (dB /dx < 0).

"Small to moderate solar energetic particle events happen regularly and extreme events happen less than a handful of times throughout the 7 active years of the 11 -year solar cycle. " Radiation can corrupt data, propagate to other systems, require component power cycling, and cause a host of other harmful effects.

40|$|In 1984, NASA {{initiated}} the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) program to test two unverified predictions of Albert Einstein s theory of general relativity, hypotheses {{about the ways}} space, time, light, and gravity relate to each other. To test these predictions, the Space Agency and researchers at Stanford University developed an experiment that would check, with extreme precision, tiny changes in the spin direction of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at a 400 -mile altitude directly over the Earth <b>s</b> <b>poles.</b> When the program first began, the researchers assessed using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to control {{the attitude of the}} GP-B spacecraft accurately. At that time, the best GPS receivers could only provide accuracy to nearly 1 meter, but the GP-B spacecraft required a system 100 times more accurate. To address this concern, researchers at Stanford designed high-performance, attitude-determining hardware that used GPS signals, perfecting a high-precision form of GPS called Carrier-Phase Differential GPS that could provide continuous real-time position, velocity, time, and attitude sensor information for all axes of a vehicle. The researchers came to the realization that controlling the GP-B spacecraft with this new system was essentially no different than controlling an airplane. Their thinking took a new direction: If this technology proved successful, the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were ready commercial markets. They set out to test the new technology, the "Integrity Beacon Landing System," using it to automatically land a commercial Boeing 737 over 100 times successfully through Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS technology. The thinking of the researchers shifted again, from automatically landing aircraft, to automating precision farming and construction equipment...|$|R
40|$|Many {{digital signal}} {{processing}} applications require linear phase filtering. Under certain conditions, a frequency sampling filter can implement a linear phase filter more efficiently than an equivalent filter implemented by a direct convolution structure. However, frequency sampling filter structures require pole-zero cancellations on the unit circle. For practical implementations of frequency sampling filters, finite word length effects usually prevent exact pole-zero cancellation. An uncancelled pole on the unit circle causes the filter to be unstable. Therefore, designers move the filter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>poles</b> and zeros off the unit circle and onto {{a circle of radius}} r where r 3 ̆c 1, by replacing z− 1 with rz− 1 in the filter 2 ̆ 7 s system function. As a result of this modification, the frequency response of the new filter using rz− 1 where r 3 ̆c 1 is different from the frequency response of the original filterwhere r = 1. As r decreases, the frequency response of the modified frequency sampling filter increasingly differs from the frequency response of the original filter, and thus values of r close to 1 are usually chosen. However, {{it has been shown that}} the filter 2 ̆ 7 s output roundoff noise decreases as r decreases. Thus, there is a need for a design technique which chooses a value of r which renders an acceptable roundoff noise level while satisfying various frequency response design constraints. This paper develops an optimization method for designing a frequency sampling filter with r 3 ̆c 1 such that a linear combination of the mean square error between the desired and actual frequency responses in the passband and stopband and the sum of the square error of the impulse response symmetry is minimized while the stopband frequency samples are constrained to zero...|$|R
40|$|The vector {{form factor}} f+(t) of the semileptonic decay D → Kℓν, {{measured}} recently {{with a high}} accuracy, {{can be used to}} determine the strong coupling constant gD ∗ sDK, which is related to the normalised coupling ˆg. This is achieved through the estimation of the residue of the form factor at the D ∗ <b>s</b> <b>pole,</b> which requires an extrapolation of the form factor in the unphysical region (mD − mK) 2 < t < (mD + mK) 2. We consider several unsophisticated parametrisations which yield results agreeing with most of the other determinations of ˆg. An apparently more elaborated parametrisation of form factors, the so-called z-expansion, is at variance with the other models, and we point out some significant drawbacks of this parametrisation for the problem under consideration. The weak transitions from one meson to another provide very interesting tests of our understanding of the Standard Model both in the weak and strong sectors. On one hand, elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix can be determined by comparing the experimentally measured decay rate with a theoretical value obtained at one or several kinematic points: for instance B → Dℓν for |Vcb|, B → πℓν for |Vub|, or K → πℓν for |Vus|. On the other hand, the shape of the spectrum provides a stringent check of our description of the dynamics of hadrons governed by QCD. The hadronic physics of the problem is encoded in form factors, which are complicated nonperturbative objects. Due to our limited theoretical knowledge of these objects, many parametrisations are available, trying to include as much information as possible on the (known or assumed) dynamics of the corresponding mesons. Recently, the BaBar collaboration has performed a very accurate analysis of the D 0 → K−e + νe decay [1] (see also the work done by the CLEO collaboration [2]).
