5|$|I am {{thinking}} this {{morning of the}} men in the mills and factories; I {{am thinking}} of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the <b>little</b> <b>children</b> who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for <b>Little</b> <b>Children,</b> Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of <b>little</b> <b>children</b> lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E

The baby was very hungry & I gave her an ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.|$|E

On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two <b>little</b> <b>children</b> and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther.

Another version of this story, possibly formed around the 11th century, claims that the butcher's victims were instead three clerks who wished to stay the night. The man murdered them, and was advised by his wife to dispose of them by turning them into meat pies. The saint saw through this and brought the men back to life.|$|E
