2500|$|In 1544, the King {{granted the}} main rectorial manor was granted (in fee) to William Sackville JP [...] In 1553 William Sackville and Eleanor passed the manor to Robert Hartopp, {{goldsmith}} of London, dying {{two years later}} succeeded by Elias his son, who was left it to his nephew John, whose widow Joan sold the manor in 1609 to George Evelyn who gave it to his son Sir John Evelyn on his marriage to Elizabeth Cocks. [...] Later owners of the manor were Sir John's purchaser James <b>Linch,</b> his issue including Susan Hussey and her son James who sold the manor in 1699 to George Roffey. [...] His nephew inherited it {{of the same name}} and in 1770 his sons sold the title alone and perhaps house to Matthew Robinson. [...] Richard Hewetson bought it in 1780 passing it to his nephew Henry Hewetson holding until the Regency period. [...] Henry's nephew William Hewetson ceased to lay claim to any manorial rights however in any event the lands had been separately sold to Henry Rowed, whose son Henry settled the estate on his wife Susan Glover in 1765.

40|$|Cette double approche de la {{conservation}} d'assemblages osseux du Pléistocene supérieur de la grotte ouest du Portel met en évidence le rôle prédominant des conditions géochimiques et taphonomiques sur la conservation du fossile et établit un lien entre structure anatomique de l'os et potentiel de conservation des protéines. Les résultats complémentaires obtenus permettent de faire le lien entre les différents modes d'altération osseuse, au-delà de la conservation différentielle classique. The {{study of}} the pleistocene's faunas shows clearly the descremenating charts of the animals skeleton elements. It {{stands to reason that}} the bones conservating procedures act directly on the assemblage representativity. Therefore we choose to joint both methods in conservation study: in one hand, there is the archaeozoological study and in the other hand the biochemical study witch consists in organic material preserved quantification. Both methods procede on a research all along the stratigraphy (fig. 1). Three complexes result of the proteins quantity analysis (tab. 2). Layers F and Fl results individualised clearly and anatomical sampling values obtained are almost similar, in exception of layer F longs bones case (tab. 1). We can generally say that a good correlation exists between the stratigraphy and the protéine study results when we put aside the middle biochemical complex. It's probable that the silly clay and stenl E layer domiciliate above the complex were obstacle of all perturbations which favorised organic matter conservation. The anatomical results show that this well conservation phenomenon is specific for long bones and don't act on other layers. It's difficult to imagine that only geochemical and fossil's age are responsible of this difference. It seems reasonnable to attribuate these phenomena to biological and taphonomical agents intervention (human kind and carnivorous). Transportation frequency (abrasion marks) is more important in upper layers (fig. 2); it prove many perturbations caused by carnivorous. Moreover bone's surface rounded frequency show an important <b>linching</b> that maybe caused by amino acids ruins. Layers from Fl to G (fig. 3) are specially characterized by human occupation (scratches and fracturation impacts). Condition of bones alteration seems to be a specific anthropic action. Horses anatomical samples come from F, F 2 and F 3 layers. We propose a global representation where long bones are most representated in the population than short and plat bones (tab. 1). Bones surronded with flesh are selected by human, whereas carnivorous have involved a diminution the distal extremity of bone, particulary in the F layer. The amino acids' rates which are homogène (fig. 4, 5, 6) from one layer to another confirm the role of taphonomical agents in the bones conservation's process. These results clearly prove that there are several conservations (anatomical, archaeological, paleontological and geochemical). El Fouikar Abderrahamane, Gardeisen Armelle.
