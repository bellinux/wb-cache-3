The {{system is designed}} around the 280 Starter System Microcomputer. The Automatic Test System (ATS) performs functional testing on both Small Scale Integration (SSI) and Medium Scale Integration (MSI) Transistor Transistor Logic (TTL) integrated circuits. Three modes of operation are provided, Learn, Test and Program. During Test Mode test patterns are applied to the Device Under Test (DUT). Its responses are compared with known-good responses previously stored in memory to determine DUT performance. These known-good responses are obtained during the <b>Learn</b> <b>Mode</b> of operation. Program mode allows IC testing when a known-good device is not available to store the test patterns responses in memory. In this mode the user generates the test patterns {{to be applied to}} the DUT. At the end of the mode the user examines the responses to these test patterns to determine DUT operation...|$|E

In our view, urban atmosphere is made of daily uses, so creating an atmosphere deals with a comprehensive approach of spaces and places. Citizens want to be considered as individuals with their own practices of urban contexts they live in. People are more and more mobile, so there have to develop special competencies to understand every space they cross, knowing places of mobility (malls, hubs, stations, bus shelters [...] .) are the most crowded spaces in cities. Moving ins't innate, it could be learned and as a sub-topic, it means learning how to move in different places. In other words, logic of user and logic of designer are often incompatible and regulation occurs during daily uses. Since 2001, RATP R 1 D work on pedagogy of mobility has been made to understand what we call "individual potential of mobility" which a conceptual model of week-being inside mobility places (vehicles and buildings, stations [...] .). This model is based in five main dimensions (language mastering, partial representation, cognitive abilities, mental and physical health, transport experiences, particularly traumatic ones) and base been developed after systematic field observations. In that, mobility has to be understood as a problem of urban time-space cognition. Cognitive psychology was very useful to link time-space recognition with activation/ inhibition processes and crystallized fluid intelligence. In a word, well-being in a "new" place (activating mental process) means forgiving another (inhibiting former experience) and more using fluid intelligence (daily routine processes). Second step was to design an operational process to help acquisition of mobility core competencies {{in the same way as}} Economics Nobel Prize A. Sen spoke about capabilities. Results was to create mobility workshops for adults dedicated to <b>learn</b> <b>mode</b> d'emploi of transport systems and mobility classrooms to dedicated to learn basics of mobility culture for young students. After 10 years of empirical validation, we can confirm that learning mobility is made of learning many places and that learning places is an ever evolving process. In conclusion, we want to stress the importance of integrating a integrating pedagogy of daily use by real users as a core dimension of designing an atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to explore the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> of small {{business}} owners, from a theoretical stance, and based on empirical evidence. We distinguish between the required <b>learning</b> <b>mode,</b> the actual <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> and the supported <b>learning</b> <b>mode.</b> Data were collected using the focus group method in a very heterogeneous sample of Belgian small business owners. The results indicate several gaps between the required, actual and supported <b>learning</b> <b>modes,</b> of which many are due to unawareness of learning needs and lack of reflective learning among small business owners. The data also indicate among others that solutions to fill learning gaps proposed in the literature are not applicable to all owners, e. g. not all owners are able to learn through networks.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is form a theoretical framework on the impact of individualism and collectivism on learning styles of individuals. By basing on a the theoretical foundations of individualism and collectivism and cultural values, it is proposed that individuals who are high on individualist values grasp experience through the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> of abstract conceptualization and transform experience through the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> of active experimentation. For the collectivist values in contrast, we proposed that the higher the collectivist values in individuals the more they prefer grasping experience through the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> of concrete experience and the more they prefer transforming experience through the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> of reflective observation. As a result it can be stated that the trainers should take cultural differences in to account in designing learning activities...|$|R

We experimentally and computationally studied the learning performance of healthy subjects in a visual-auditory sensory associative learning task across active learning, attention cueing learning, and passive <b>learning</b> <b>modes.</b> According to our results, the <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> had no {{significant effect on}} learning association of congruent pairs. In addition, subjects' performance in learning congruent samples was not correlated with their vigilance score. Nevertheless, vigilance score was significantly correlated with the learning performance of the non-congruent pairs. Moreover, in the last block of the passive <b>learning</b> <b>mode,</b> subjects significantly made more mistakes in taking non-congruent pairs as associated and consciously reported lower confidence. These results indicate that attention and activity equally enhanced visual-auditory associative learning for non-congruent pairs, while false alarm rate in the passive <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> did not decrease after the second block. We investigated the cause of higher false alarm rate in the passive <b>learning</b> <b>mode</b> by using a computational model, composed of a reinforcement learning module and a memory-decay module.

Inference learn-ing tends to focus subjects on the internal struc-ture of each category, while classification learning highlights information that discriminates between the categories.

40|$|SUMMARY According to {{experience}} learning theory (ELT) {{learning is a}} process.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to collect data with the LSI and present: (a) the test–retest reliability coef cients for the different learning modes; (b) the correlation between different <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> and age; (c) gender differences in the learning modes; and (d) homogeneous groups of students with different learning styles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>modes</b> of social <b>learning</b> and level of team familiarity, i. e. agents that have worked together before, on team performance. A computational model is implemented under a set of typical social <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> in a team environment. In this model, agents can learn from personal interaction with other agents and the tasks, and by observing interaction among other agents and the tasks. Agents in the team are considered domain experts, which means the task knowledge is pre-coded. Agents learn about each others competence (i. e., who knows what), which leads to the formation of a team mental model. Agents that have team familiarity are expected to have developed each other’s mental model to the extent facilitated by the available <b>learning</b> <b>modes.</b> Simulations are conducted with team familiarity and <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> as parameters. Simulation results indicate that team performance is positively correlated with social learning and team familiarity.
