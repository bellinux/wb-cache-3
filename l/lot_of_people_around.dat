500|$|... "Strange Ones" [...] and [...] "I'd Like To Know" [...] {{are both}} songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's {{a few people who}} are just really out there. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing." [...] Danny Goffey added, [...] "They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria {{to fall back on}} and is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives of a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's {{not a good idea to}} have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E
2500|$|The notes {{accompanying}} the track listing on the LP sleeve {{were taken from}} a Zapple press release written by Richard DiLello, {{who served in the}} position of [...] "house hippy" [...] at the Beatles' Apple headquarters. Among DiLello's comments, he described [...] "No Time or Space" [...] as [...] "a pottage of space music" [...] and said of [...] "Under the Mersey Wall": [...] "in a mounting vortex of decibels, there came to pass a wrecked chord of environmental sound that went beyond the genre of hashish cocktail music. The bass line had been milked through the Moog machine and, lo and high, we behold electronic music …" [...] The inside sleeve included a quotation attributed to [...] "Arthur Wax": [...] "There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around,</b> making a lot of noise; here's some more." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. sources told The Washington Post in 1985 {{that the}} LaRouche {{organization}} had assembled a worldwide network {{of government and}} military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche {{and his wife had}} visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised [...] "one of the best private intelligence services in the world[...] [...] [...] They do know a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the world.

5000|$|The album also {{documents}} the brief tenure of Lowell George (guitar and vocals), {{who went on}} to found the country-rock band Little Feat with Mothers bassist Roy Estrada. On [...] "Didja Get Any Onya", George affects a German accent to relate a story of being a small boy in Germany and seeing [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> stand <b>around</b> on the corners asking questions, 'Why are you standing on the corner, acting the way you act, looking the way you look, why do you look that way?'" ...|$|R
500|$|One {{song on the}} record, [...] "Scalinatella", is sung in Neapolitan, {{rather than}} Italian, which {{required}} Patton to re-learn the correct inflections and pronunciations in that language. However, the conductor of the orchestra Patton used on tour {{was a native of}} Naples and would frequently correct the singer during rehearsal until he was able to perform it correctly. Describing this collaboration, Patton noted [...] "I had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> great <b>people</b> <b>around</b> me. I wouldn’t {{have been able to do}} any of this shit without them".|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, and there is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Black Flag's {{career is}} chronicled in Our Band Could Be Your Life, {{a study of}} several {{important}} American underground rock bands.

Steve Turner of Mudhoney stated in an interview, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> other <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down ... but up here it was really great – we were like 'Yay!'

5000|$|Cochrane {{would put}} himself out {{not only for}} friends but for anyone in need, {{sometimes}} at considerable risk to himself. On one occasion, in 1987, he was in an Oxford Street underground station late at night {{when he saw a}} group of eight to ten men beating up two others. He said, [...] "They were punching and kicking one in particular, really laying into him. There were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> other <b>people</b> <b>around</b> but everyone else was just letting it happen. They probably would have killed that bloke if I hadn't stepped in." ...|$|R
5000|$|The final track, [...] "Vampire Money", was a {{reaction}} to the band being asked to do a song for the Twilight franchise. Gerard Way said that the reason the song was on the album was because [...] "there’s a lot of people chasing that fucking money. ‘Twilight?’ A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> us were like, ‘please, for the love of God, do this fucking movie.’ But we’d moved on." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was a quick}} {{song for}} me because I've spent months on one line. It just came to me one day as I was driving home, feeling all this {{frustration}} of two years without making a record. So I decided to write a song not about giving someone {{the best years of}} my life, but to write about the pursuit of success, which I thought related to a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the world, not just in music but anything".

5000|$|As ranking {{minority}} {{member of}} the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hatch fought hard to get conservative judges nominated to the Supreme Court.

5000|$|Regarding the track, [...] "Sandra from Scranton", Finn noted: [...] "That one {{focuses on}} people who are aging hippies, still caught up {{in some kind of}} hipster {{lifestyle}} and trying to hang on to their youth by doing the same things that they did in their twenties. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> those <b>people</b> <b>around,</b> but I have a different way of looking at life these days: My version of growing older is not getting depressed or being in denial about it, but instead it’s 'Hey, we’ve survived!'" ...|$|R

In the meantime, Erica and Matt are falling in love, and they plan a special encounter for the 40th night to celebrate his successfully completing his vow.

5000|$|Chamberlain said {{he enjoyed}} {{playing the role}} [...] "because he {{believed}} in grasping every moment of life and making {{the most out of}} it.

5000|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to lead singer Bradford Cox’s obsessive traits. In 2015, Cox reflected on his life while writing, recording and promoting Monomania, stating: I was actually going through a deep period of passionate rage. ... That was what I was like at that time: a mixed-up wreck. Monomania was a very hateful record, and I mistreated a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> me.

5000|$|Eva and Juan {{remember}} this period as a difficult time. [...] "After ‘Pájaros en la cabeza’ we toured {{and it was}} a long and hard phase. It was all too much to handle. Suddenly, there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> us who made us be worried about a lot more things than music, so we decided to detach ourselves from all that.

Conditions aboard ship appalled Lee Cheong, for instance, when he visited his father's quarters: [...] "The smell ... I remember the smell and the incredibly cramped conditions. I remember going down below, {{rows and rows of}} bunks, knapsacks and all sorts of junk stuffed in every nook and cranny ... <b>lots</b> and <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> milling <b>around.</b> I couldn’t think of anything worse than those sorts of conditions."
