40|$|PURPOSE: Stereotactic body {{radiation}} therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been evaluated in several recent studies. The CyberKnife(®) is an SBRT {{system that allows}} for real-time tracking of the tumor. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the prognostic factors for <b>local</b> <b>control</b> and overall survival following this treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 75 patients with 96 liver-confined HCC were treated with SBRT at the Oscar Lambret Comprehensive Cancer Center. Fiducials were implanted in the liver before treatment and were used as markers to track the lesion's movement. Treatment response was scored according to RECIST v 1. 1. <b>Local</b> <b>control</b> and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan and Meier method. A stepwise multivariate analysis (Cox regression) of prognostic factors was performed for <b>local</b> <b>control</b> and overall survival. RESULTS: There were 67 patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Class A and eight patients with CTP Class B. Treatment was administered in three sessions. A total dose of 40 - 45 Gy to the 80 % isodose line was delivered. The median follow-up was 10 months (range, 3 - 49 months). The <b>local</b> <b>control</b> rate was 89. 8 % at 1 and 2 years. Overall survival was 78. 5 % and 50. 4 % at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Toxicity mainly consisted of grade 1 and grade 2 events. Higher alpha-fetoprotein (aFP) levels were associated with less favorable <b>local</b> <b>control</b> (HR= 1. 001; 95 % CI [1. 000, 1. 002]; p= 0. 0063). A higher dose was associated with better <b>local</b> <b>control</b> (HR= 0. 866; 95 % CI [0. 753, 0. 996]; p= 0. 0441). A Child-Pugh score higher than 5 was associated with worse overall survival (HR= 3. 413; 95 % CI [1. 235, 9. 435]; p= 0. 018). CONCLUSION: SBRT affords good <b>local</b> tumor <b>control</b> and higher overall survival rates than other historical controls (best supportive care or sorafenib). High aFP levels were associated with lesser <b>local</b> <b>control,</b> but a higher treatment dose improved <b>local</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess whether}} {{incorporation}} of measurements of surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF(2)) and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) into a tumor control probability (tcp) model increases their prognostic significance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Measurements of SF(2) and CFE were available {{from a study}} on carcinoma of the cervix treated with radiation alone. These measurements, as well as tumor volume, dose, and treatment time, were incorporated into a Poisson tcp model (tcp(alpha,rho)). Regression analysis was performed to assess the prognostic power of tcp(alpha,rho) vs. the use of either tcp models with biologic parameters fixed to best-fit estimates (but incorporating individual dose, volume, and treatment time) {{or the use of}} SF(2) and CFE measurements alone. RESULTS: In a univariate regression analysis of 44 patients, tcp(alpha,rho) was a better prognostic factor for both <b>local</b> <b>control</b> and survival (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 049, respectively) than SF(2) alone (p = 0. 009 for <b>local</b> <b>control,</b> p = 0. 29 for survival) or CFE alone (p = 0. 015 for <b>local</b> <b>control,</b> p = 0. 38 for survival). In multivariate analysis, tcp(alpha,rho) emerged as the most important prognostic factor for <b>local</b> <b>control</b> (p < 0. 001, relative risk of 2. 81). After allowing for tcp(alpha,rho), CFE was still a significant independent prognostic factor for <b>local</b> <b>control,</b> whereas SF(2) was not. The sensitivities of tcp(alpha,rho) and SF(2) as predictive tests for <b>local</b> <b>control</b> were 87 % and 65 %, respectively. Specificities were 70 % and 77 %, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} prognostic significance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging - determined tumor parameters, especially {{the presence of}} cartilage invasion, regarding <b>local</b> <b>control</b> of glottic squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone. Materials and Methods: The study was performed {{with the approval of}} our institutional review board; direct patient consent was waived. Pretreatment MR images of 118 patients aged 41 - 86 years (110 men, eight women) with glottic carcinoma treated with RT alone were reviewed for tumor involvement of specific laryngeal anatomic subsites (including laryngeal cartilage), tumor volume, and extralaryngeal tumor spread; these findings were compared with <b>local</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Local</b> <b>control</b> was defined as absence of a recurrence at the primary site for 2 years. Statistical significance of differences between curves for <b>local</b> <b>control</b> estimated with the Kaplan- Meier method was tested with log- rank test. Results: Results of univariate analysis showed all MR imaging determined parameters to be significant predictors of <b>local</b> <b>control</b> rate, compared with clinical parameters where T classification and vocal cord mobility were the only significant parameters associated with <b>local</b> <b>control.</b> Multivariate analysis (Cox regression model) of clinical and radiologic parameters revealed that hypopharyngeal extension (P =. 04) and intermediate T 2 signal intensity (SI) in cartilage similar to tumor SI (P <. 001) were independent prognostic factors with regard to <b>local</b> <b>control.</b> Conclusion: Intermediate T 2 SI in cartilage, which may suggest cartilage invasion, and hypopharyngeal extension of tumor, predict greater likelihood of local failure, whereas high T 2 SI, which may suggest inflammatory tissue in cartilage, predicts lower likelihood of local failure.
