5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls {{such as the}} <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> and the {{long-eared owl}} cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, <b>little</b> <b>owl,</b> and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E

To {{combat the}} threat of predation, prey species have developed {{a variety of ways}} to recognize and respond appropriately to novel predators. While there is evidence that predator recognition does not require learning in certain species, learning appears {{to play an important role}} for other species. In systems where learning is important, it is less clear whether predator identification requires prior experience with specific predators or, whether general experience with predators provides sufficient tools for identifying similar species of novel predators. Here we test whether wild-living adult birds recognize a dangerous predator that occurs in only part of their geographical range. We presented taxidermy mounts of <b>little</b> <b>owls,</b> Athene noctua, and sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, to blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major. All populations of both tit species co-occur with sparrowhawks, but populations differ in their prior experience with <b>little</b> <b>owls.</b> We found that tits that overlap geographically with <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> responded to <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> using the same intensity of mobbing behaviour exhibited toward sparrowhawks. In populations with no historical contact with <b>little</b> <b>owls,</b> however, both blue and great tits treated <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> as a lower threat than sparrowhawks. These results suggest that blue tits and great tits do not generalize ‘predatory features’ to novel predators and instead need prior experience with specific predators before they assign the correct level of threat.

40|$|Anti–predator {{training}} of juvenile <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> was {{tested in a}} sample of recovered owls raised in captivity in Brinzal Owl Rescue Center (Madrid, Spain). Mortality caused by predators has been described previously in released individuals. Nine <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> were conditioned during their development to a naturalized goshawk and a large live rat, whose presence was paired to the owl’s alarm call. All nine owls and seven non–trained individuals were then released during the late summer and autumn and radio–tracked for six weeks to test their survival. In total 71. 4 % of the trained owls survived while only the 33. 3 % of the untrained group were alive at the end of week six. The only cause of death that was detected was predation. Antipredator training, therefore, seems to be beneficial in maximizing survival after the release of juvenile <b>little</b> <b>owls...</b>|$|R
25|$|Later in the summer, a small {{delegation}} of Cherokee under Dragging Canoe's brother <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> traveled north {{to meet with}} the Indian leaders of the Western Confederacy, chief among them Blue Jacket (Weyapiersenwah) of the Shawnee, Little Turtle (Mishikinakwa) of the Miami, and Buckongahelas of the Lenape. While they were there, word arrived that Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, was planning an invasion against the allied tribes in the north. <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> immediately sent word south to Running Water.|$|E
25|$|In answer, Dragging Canoe sent a {{delegation}} of leaders led by <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> to Nashville under a flag of truce to explain that his Cherokee were not the responsible parties. Meanwhile, the attacks continued.|$|E
25|$|Following that treaty, Dragging Canoe {{turned to}} the Spanish (who still claimed all the {{territory}} south of the Cumberland and were now working against the Americans) for support, trading primarily through Pensacola and Mobile. Dragging Canoe also maintained relations with the British governor at Detroit, Alexander McKee, through regular diplomatic missions there under his brothers <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and The Badger (Ukuna).|$|E

25|$|Dragging Canoe quickly sent a 30-strong war party north {{under his}} brother The Badger, where, {{along with the}} warriors of <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and Turtle-at-Home they participated in the decisive {{encounter}} in November 1791 known as the Battle of the Wabash, the worst defeat ever inflicted by Native Americans upon the American military, the American military body count of which far surpassed that at the more famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1792, a war party from Running Water led by <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and the Shawnee Warrior joined them in their raids. On June 26, {{the same day that}} Dragging Canoe was being memorialized at the {{national}} council in Ustanali, the combined group of Cherokee, Shawnee, and a few Muscogee destroyed Zeigler's Station in Sumner County. This action led the governor of Miro District, James Robertson, to call up a battalion of troops to spread throughout the region as guards.|$|E
25|$|Because {{this was}} a move into the {{outskirts}} of Muscogee territory, Dragging Canoe, knowing such a move might be necessary, had previously sent a delegation under <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> to meet with Alex McGillivray, the major Muscogee leader in the area, to gain their permission to do so. When the Cherokee moved their base, so too did John McDonald, now deputy to Thomas Brown, along with his own assistant Daniel Ross, making Running Water the base of operations. Graham's deputy, Alexander Campbell, set up his own base at what became Turkeytown.|$|E

25|$|Near {{their target}} {{on the evening}} of September 30, Watts's {{combined}} force came upon a small fort known as Buchanan's Station, commanded by John Buchanan, son of the original owner of Sapling Grove. Talotiskee, leader of the Muscogee, wanted to attack it immediately, while Watts argued in favor of saving it for the return south. After much bickering, Watts gave in around midnight. The assault proved to be a disaster for Watts. He himself was wounded, and many of his warriors were killed, including Talotiskee and some of Watts' best leaders; Shawnee Warrior, Kitegisky, and Dragging Canoe's brother <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> were among those who died in the encounter.|$|E
25|$|Owls, {{which may}} have {{dissimilar}} periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from golden eagle predation either. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and {{some parts of the}} Western United States. Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large great horned, Eurasian eagle and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa). Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been predated by golden eagles in both North America and Eurasia. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, barn owls made up 4.5% of the diet, the largest known occurrence of that species in the eagles' diet. However, the great horned owl is the owl species that occurs most regularly in the diet of North American golden eagles. In Europe, golden eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian eagle-owls and northern goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are Ural owls (Strix uralensis) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Few eye-witness accounts are known of owl predation, but one violent mid-day confrontation between a golden eagle and an adult great horned owl was witnessed in Jefferson County, Colorado. Although this owl was {{about a third of the}} eagle's weight, it was able to land some damaging blows on the larger bird. In the end, despite its wounds, the eagle was victorious over the dead owl. A case of kleptoparasitism by a golden eagle on a great horned owl has been recorded.|$|E

500|$|Adults {{and young}} are {{vulnerable}} to predation at the breeding colonies, their only defence being to spit oil. Petrels cannot breed on islands where rats have been introduced, and feral cats frequently kill these birds on Foula in the Shetland Islands. The American mink, a non-native species in Europe, is a strong swimmer, and can colonise islands up to [...] from the mainland. Natural predators of petrels and other seabirds include skuas and large gulls. The yellow-legged gull is a particular problem in the Mediterranean, and great skuas were estimated to kill 7,500 petrels a year on St Kilda, an unsustainable number. Some great black-backed gulls on the Atlantic islands specialise in taking seabird chicks at night, and peregrine falcons hunt adults at sea. Localised predators include Eleonora's falcon on the Columbretes Islands and the nocturnal barn owl on the Balearics; a few owls can wipe out a colony. The <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> is also a predator of both adults and young where it occurs.|$|E
