40|$|To study <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> Litchi (Litchi chinensis sonn.) fruit as {{affected}} {{by exposure to}} sunlight and fruit orientation on the tree, five cultivars viz; Purbi, Bedana, Bombai, Serai and Gola were collected. Fruits of each cultivar were picked from exposed, unexposed, upper <b>half</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. The unexposed fruits were found heavier in weight, stone, peel and pulp. The fruits at <b>Lower</b> <b>half</b> were found heavy in weight, pericarp and flesh. However, stone weight {{was found to be}} more in fruits collected from upper <b>half</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. As unexposed fruits were massive therefore, it is advisable to pick these fruits first if chemical parameters are not included in selection. Hence it is concluded that picking should be started from those fruits which are positioned at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree in order to collect fruits of superior quality first. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E

5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example).

Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally {{finished in the}} <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or better.) With the exception of Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} fluctuation {{and distribution of}} Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and Thrips tabaci Lindeman populations in various developmental stages (larvae I, II and adults) was studied in two crops: cucumber (Cucumis sativus L., F 1 Kamaron) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum M., F 1 Arletta) during April-August 2000. Samples of leaves and flowers were collected from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plants. <b>The</b> population peak <b>of</b> F. occidentalis and T. tabaci in cucumber and tomato crops was observed between 20 / 5 / 2000 and 30 / 5 / 2000. The distribution data for both Thrips species showed that they prefer cucumber to tomato. Both Thrips species prefer leaves than flowers and the upper <b>half</b> than <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plants. Additional laboratory research was conducted to determine <b>the</b> predatory effect <b>of</b> Coccinella septempunctata on both Thrips species. According to number of thrips found on cucumber and tomato leaves, <b>the</b> predatory effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ladybird was also determined indicating that, when pest density is high, then predation may be ineffective...|$|R

5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. The <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as {{it was supposed to}} convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, {{and work on the}} <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E
5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Klamath is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} river {{as well as an}} important source of water for agriculture. It includes many of the longest free-flowing stretches of river in California, including excellent stretches of whitewater. However, dams and diversions in the upper basin have often caused water quality issues in the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. Environmental groups and native tribes have proposed broad changes to water use in the Klamath Basin, including the removal of some dams on the river to expand fish habitat. They put forth their concerns in what is now the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement, a water management plan signed by local communities, governments, tribal groups, environmentalists, and fishermen. The proposal has been endorsed by the U.S. Department of the Interior but has not been authorized by the United States Congress.|$|E
