25|$|On December 16, 2006, the Park Police {{pulled over}} Barry for driving too slowly, which Barry later said {{was because he}} {{was trying to figure out}} where to enter an {{elementary}} school's parking <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nonprofit foundation's event. After looking up Barry's record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry's insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry's license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.|$|E

[...] In 1849, church land was graded and new horse sheds built.|$|E
500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

Among them was actor Mickey Rourke, who spoke to television news crews that came to cover the event.

Accepting the challenge, Rusty James then talks with his friends— the wily Smokey, loyal B.J., and nerdy Steve - who all have a different take on the forthcoming fight. Steve mentions that Rusty James' older brother, [...] "The Motorcycle Boy," [...] would not be pleased with the fight as he had previously created a truce forbidding gang fights, or [...] "rumbles." [...] Rusty James dismisses him, saying that Motorcycle Boy (whose real name is never revealed) has been gone for two months, leaving without explanation or promise of return.|$|E

50|$|The State Senators {{were elected}} on general tickets in the senatorial districts, and were then {{divided into four}} classes.

50|$|In 1905, by {{an act of}} Congress, the unallotted land of the Ute Indian Reservation {{was opened}} to homesteading.

50|$|Enumclaw {{itself was}} homesteaded in 1879 by Frank and Mary Stevenson.

60|$|And Egbert, {{he turned}} her old dark, Catholic blood-authority {{into a sort}} of tyranny. He would not leave her her children.

60|$|And {{the chat}} went on without further insistance on the Princess of Eboli. That {{comparison}} escaped Mirah's lips under {{the urgency of}} a pang unlike anything she had felt before.
