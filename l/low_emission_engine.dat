Under this program, significant {{progress has been made in}} advancing the state of the art of lubrication technology for advanced engine research and development. Some of the highlights are: (1) developed an advanced high temperature liquid lubricant capable of sustaining high temperatures in a prototype heat engine; (2) developed a novel liquid lubricant which potentially could lower the emission of heavy duty diesel engines; (3) developed lubricant chemistries for ceramics used in the heat engines; (4) developed application maps for ceramic lubricant chemistry combinations for design purpose; and (5) developed novel test methods to screen lubricant chemistries for automotive air-conditioning compressors lubricated by R- 134 a (Freon substitute). Most of these findings have been reported to the DOE program office through Argonne National Laboratory who manages the overall program.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to curb {{emissions}} from gas turbine engines, many <b>low</b> <b>emission</b> <b>engine</b> concepts have been developed. Among the most promising {{of these is the}} LDI (Lean Direct Injection). These systems operate at relatively low equivalence ratios close to blowout and are prone to instabilities. Combustion instabilities can reduce the life of the combustor by causing large pressure fluctuations and enhanced heat release to the walls of the combustor and reduce the efficiency of the engines. The understanding of combustion instabilities is vital to the implementation of such systems. Combustion instabilities are studied in an self-excited single element gas turbine combustor that uses an LDI element for fuel injection at elevetaed chamber pressures. ^ The LDI combustor uses a swirler to ensure mixing of the air and the fuel and expansion of the swirl through a pressure swirl venturi to create a swirl stabilized flame. This project aims to study the heat release modes that occur in the combustor through measurement of light emissions from the flame using photodiodes that are sensitive to wavelengths of light produced by the flame. These are used along with high frequency pressure transducers. The focus is on the flame behavior in the diverging section of the venturi where the swirl is expanded and the flame starts since optic access cannot be obtained in this section. The use of photodiodes also facilitates the study of hydrodynamic modes that occur in the combustor alongside the thermoacoustics. A section which could accommodate the photodiodes was designed and installed on the LDI test rig in the Gas Turbine Cell at Maurice J Zucrow Propulsion Labs at Purdue University. ^ The combustor was tested with this section and dynamic data was obtained from the pressure transducers and the photodiodes for a range of inlet air temperatures and range of equivalence ratios for each inlet air temperature. The dominant instability modes in both sets of data were analyzed and are presented in this document. The dominant heat release modes share similarities but often differ from the dominant pressure modes observed. The data also indicated the presence of azimuthal modes and suggested the presence of a PVC (precessing vortex core) although a definite PVC mode was not picked up by the photodiode data. ^ Overall, the testing was successful and the heat release modes could be analyzed from the photodiode data but a complete picture could not be obtained due to noise and heating issues in the photodiodes which limited the amount of data that could be obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{continuous}} demand for high performances and <b>low</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>engines</b> leads the engine manufactures {{to set the}} operating range of combustion devices near to their stability limit. Combustion stability {{is closely related to}} the formation of the first ignition kernel: an effective way of lowering Cycle-by-Cycle Variation (CCV) is to enhance the start of combustion by means of multiple sparks. A Ducati engine was equipped with a Twin Spark ignition system and a consistent improvement in combustion stability arised for both part load and full load conditions. At part load a sensible reduction of cycle-by-cycle variability of indicated mean effective pressure was found, while at full load condition the twin spark configuration showed an increase of power, but with higher knocking tendency. The aim of this work is to better understand the root causes of the increased level of knock and to make a critical evaluation of most used knock indexes, by means of an accurate analysis of the experimental and simulated pressure signals.

Understanding the contact interactions and lubricant film formation at this interface is crucial for the development of fuel-efficient and <b>low</b> <b>emission</b> <b>engines.</b> This article outlines the development of an ultrasonic approach to enable non-invasive measurement of the lubricant film thickness formed between piston and cylinder wall of a fired engine. The sensor system consisted of a series of small, low cost piezoelectric elements which were bonded to the external surface of a four-stroke, single-cylinder engine. Each element could be individually energised with a short duration voltage pulse and reflections from the cylinder inner bore recorded. By using high frequency pulsing and data capture it proved possible to image individual ring and skirt contacts at full engine speeds. These captured reflections were processed to give lubricant film thickness directly and without the need for independent calibration. The results show good repeatability between cycle sets at specific running conditions. The lubricant films at each of the ring contacts can be measured at sufficient resolution such that individual rails of the oil control ring can be monitored.

40|$|The engine {{industry}} is currently facing severe emissions mandates. Pollutant emissions from mobile sources {{are a major}} source of concern. For example, US EPA mandates require emissions of particulate and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from heavy-duty diesel engine exhaust to drop at least 90 percent between 1998 and 2010. Effective analysis of the combustion process is required to guide the selection of technologies for future development since exhaust after-treatment solutions are not currently available that can meet the required emission reduction goals. The goal of this project is to develop methods to optimize and control Low Temperature Combustion Diesel technologies (LTC-D) that offers the potential of nearly eliminating engine NOx and particulate emissions at reduced cost over traditional methods by controlling pollutant emissions in-cylinder. The work was divided into 5 Tasks, featuring experimental and modeling components: 1.) Fundamental understanding of LTC-D and advanced model development, 2.) Experimental investigation of LTC-D combustion control concepts, 3.) Application of detailed models for optimization of LTC-D combustion and emissions, 4.) Impact of heat transfer and spray impingement on LTC-D combustion, and 5.) Transient engine control with mixed-mode combustion. As described in the final report (December 2008), outcomes from the research included providing guidelines to the engine and energy industries for achieving optimal low temperature combustion operation through using advanced fuel injection strategies, and the potential to extend low temperature operation through manipulation of fuel characteristics. In addition, recommendations were made for improved combustion chamber geometries that are matched to injection sprays and that minimize wall fuel films. The role of fuel-air mixing, fuel characteristics, fuel spray/wall impingement and heat transfer on LTC-D engine control were revealed.

Towards this goal, the present work addresses the formation of soot particles both from a chemical and statistical point of view. As a first step, a chemical model is developed to describe the formation of soot precursors from the combustion of several components typically found in surrogates, including n-heptane, iso-octane, benzene, and toluene. The same mechanism is also used to predict the formation of large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) up to cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (C_(18) H_(10)). Then, a new soot model which represents soot particles as fractal aggregates is used. In this model, a soot particle is described by three variables: its volume (V), its surface area (S), and the number of hydrogen sites on the surface (H). The Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM) is used as a precise representation of the population of soot particles which includes small spherical particles and large aggregates. This model is shown to predict accurately the formation of soot in a wide range of flames including premixed and counter flow diffusion flames, low and high temperature flames and for a wide range of fuels from ethylene to iso-octane. Finally, this model predicts several aggregate properties like the primary particle diameter and gives insight into the reactivity of the soot surface...|$|R

5000|$|Some Diesel-powered cars can {{run with}} minor {{modifications}} on 100% pure vegetable oils. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify {{if it is}} waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances. Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( [...] VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if {{it has been used}} for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity.

Modern <b>low</b> <b>emission</b> diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use pure vegetable oil as fuel. Vegetable oil fuel is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced. This reduces the market as increasing numbers of new vehicles are not able to use it. However, the German Elsbett company has successfully produced single tank vegetable oil fuel systems for several decades, and has worked with Volkswagen on their TDI engines. This shows that it is technologically possible to use vegetable oil as a fuel in high efficiency / <b>low</b> <b>emission</b> diesel <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Biodiesel (Fatty acid methyl ester), is commercially {{available}} in most oilseed-producing {{states in the}} United States. As of 2005, it is somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol). Many farmers who raise oilseeds use a biodiesel blend in tractors and equipment {{as a matter of}} policy, to foster production of biodiesel and raise public awareness. It is sometimes easier to find biodiesel in rural areas than in cities. Biodiesel has lower Energy Density than fossil diesel fuel, so biodiesel vehicles are not quite able {{to keep up with the}} fuel economy of a fossil fuelled diesel vehicle, if the diesel injection system is not reset for the new fuel. If the injection timing is changed to take account of the higher Cetane value of biodiesel, the difference in economy is negligible. Because biodiesel contains more oxygen than diesel or vegetable oil fuel, it produces the <b>lowest</b> <b>emissions</b> from diesel <b>engines,</b> and is lower in most <b>emissions</b> than gasoline <b>engines.</b> Biodiesel has a higher lubricity than mineral diesel and is an additive in European pump diesel for lubricity and emissions reduction.|$|R
