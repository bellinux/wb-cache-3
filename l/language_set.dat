40|$|Since {{long time}} ago, age factor {{has become one}} of the most {{controversial}} topics in second language education field. Some studies conducted in natural <b>language</b> <b>setting</b> revealed that early start is a good predictor for L 2 learners in reaching native-like accuracy. However, the current studies in instructed <b>language</b> <b>setting</b> showed that age factor is not the most determining factor to achieve such goal. Responding to that issue, this study aimed to argue about a commonly over-generalized assumption of “the earlier the better” theory in instructed <b>language</b> <b>setting.</b> The study mainly discussed the implementation of English language teaching in Indonesian setting and how age factor is or is not the most important predictor for language attainment success. The study was a critical analysis upon relevant books and journals. The result of the study conveyed that age was not always the most dominant factor in successfully achieving a language attainment in instructed <b>language</b> <b>setting.</b> In most cases, there was positive support confirming that adult learners in instructed <b>language</b> <b>setting</b> could outperform young learners over some language domains. As conclusion, an early start in instructed <b>language</b> <b>setting</b> would not always lead to a better language attainment without adequate comprehensible input and learning motivation. Therefore, Indonesian government should consider more language empowering programs to support language learners to study English, for example by revitalizing its curriculum implementation and adding more learning facilities...|$|R

An Odissi performance repertoire includes invocation, nritta (pure dance), nritya (expressive dance), natya (dance drama) and moksha (dance climax connoting freedom of the soul and spiritual release).|$|E

6000|$|Pretensions are {{sometimes}} advanced as to Wordsworth's historic position, which involve a mistaken view of literary history. Thus, we are gravely {{told by the}} too zealous Wordsworthian that the so-called poets {{of the eighteenth century}} were simply men of letters; they had various accomplishments and great general ability, but their thoughts were expressed in prose, or in mere metrical diction, which passed current as poetry without being so. Yet Burns belonged wholly to the eighteenth century (1759-96), and no verse-writer is so little literary as Burns, so little prosaic; no writer more truly poetic in melody, diction, thought, feeling, and spontaneous song. It was Burns who showed Wordsworth's own youth [...] "How verse may build a princely throne on humble truth." [...] Nor can we understand how Cowper is to be set down as simply a man of letters. We may, too, if we please, deny the name of poetry to Collins's tender and pensive Ode to Evening; but we can only do this on critical principles, which would end in classing the author of Lycidas and Comus, of the Allegro and Penseroso, as a writer of various accomplishments and great general ability, but at bottom simply a man of letters and by no means a poet. It is to Gray, however, that we must turn for the distinctive character of the best poetry of the eighteenth century. With reluctance we will surrender the Pindaric Odes, though not without risking the observation that some of Wordsworth's own criticism on Gray is as narrow and as much beside the mark as Jeffrey's on the Excursion. But the Ode on Eton College is not to have grudged to it the noble name and true quality of poetry, merely because, as one of Johnson's most unfortunate criticisms expresses it, the ode suggests nothing to Gray which every beholder does not equally think and feel. To find beautiful and pathetic <b>language,</b> <b>set</b> to harmonious numbers, for the common impressions of meditative minds, is no small part of the poet's task. That part has never been achieved by any poet in any tongue with more complete perfection and success than in the immortal Elegy, of which we may truly say that it has for nearly {{a century and a half}} given to greater multitudes of men more of the exquisite pleasure of poetry than any other single piece in all the glorious treasury of English verse. It abounds, as Johnson says, [...] "with images which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo." [...] These moving commonplaces of the human lot Gray approached through books and studious contemplation; not, as Wordsworth approached them, by daily contact with the lives and habit of men and the forces and magical apparitions of external nature. But it is a narrow view to suppose that the men of the eighteenth century did not look through the literary conventions of the day to the truths of life and nature behind them. The conventions have gone, or are changed, and we are all glad of it. Wordsworth effected a wholesome deliverance when he attacked the artificial diction, the personifications, the allegories, the antitheses, the barren rhymes and monotonous metres, which the reigning taste had approved. But while welcoming the new freshness, sincerity, and direct and fertile return on nature, that is a very bad reason why we should disparage poetry so genial, so simple, so humane, and so perpetually pleasing, as the best verse of the rationalistic century.|$|E
