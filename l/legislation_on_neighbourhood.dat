40|$|Neighbourhood {{effects and}} worker {{mobility}} {{have been proposed}} as explanations for the pattern of employment in cities. This paper presents a the oretical framework within which the joint impact of these two factors can be analyzed. The evolution of unemployment patterns is modelled as a stochastic process, where workers sometimes make employment decisions influenced by local norms, and sometimes decisions of where to live based <b>on</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> characteristics. A long run outcome of full employment and complete segregation {{is found to be}} robust {{to a wide range of}} process specifications. More nonsegregated long run outcomes are possible if mobility decisions are based <b>on</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> employment rates than if they are based <b>on</b> other <b>neighbourhood</b> characteristics...|$|R

After {{constructing the}} Gelfand transform for these algebras, we develop the functional calculus for holomorphic functions <b>on</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> {{of the joint}} spectra of finitely many elements and for holomorphic functions <b>on</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> of the Gelfand spectrum. To this end, we study the algebra of holomorphic germs in weak*-compact subsets of the dual. We emphasize the simultaneous analyticity of the functional calculus in both the function and its arguments and its naturality. Finally, we treat systems of analytic equations in these algebras...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the issues {{pertaining to the}} adoption and development of <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular migration {{in the context of}} uncontrolled {{growth in the number of}} immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East to the EU. The article attempts at studying the EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular migration, classifying it, and analysing the prospects of EU migration legislation in the light of an increase in irregular immigration into the EU. The author systematises, classifies the current EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration, and analyses the conditions, in which this legislation was developed. Using the legislation analysis method, the author proposes the following system of EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration: rules preventing assistance to irregular immigration, rules preventing employment of irregular immigrants, rules on the return of irregular migrants and readmission, rules on border control, and rules on collaboration with third countries. The author pays special attention to analysing the current state of irregular immigration to the EU, which was dubbed the "greatest migration crisis in Europe". The conclusion is that the European Union succeeded in the development of pioneering <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration, which can serve as the basis for reception by other states. However, changes in the political and economic situation in the EU's southern borderlands made the current legal mechanisms incapable of withstanding new threats. It necessitates a radical reform of the <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration...|$|R
