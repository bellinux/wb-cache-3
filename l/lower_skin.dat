5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E

25|$|During the dermal closure, the nipple-areola {{complex is}} {{transposed}} {{to its new}} locale, {{as determined by the}} skin pedicle. To create the curvilinear scar, the deep dermal closure is accomplished by rotating the lateral flap down and then medially. The deep dermis is approximated (joined) with sutures, in a simple, interrupted fashion. The key suture is emplaced at the junction where the apex of the vertical incision meets the nipple-areola complex—because it is the skin area of the breast subject to the greatest tension(s). The subcutaneous dermal closure is effected with interrupted sutures. As required, the final adjustments before suturing the skin closed, might include either micro-liposuction or additional de-epithelialization. After the dermal closure, a suture is emplaced to achieve the continuous approximation of the nipple-areola complex to the adjacent skin edge, and to the <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> incisions.|$|E

2500|$|Darkly pigmented, eumelanin-rich skin {{protects against}} DNA {{damage caused by}} the sunlight. [...] This is {{associated}} with <b>lower</b> <b>skin</b> cancer rates among dark-skinned populations. The presence of pheomelanin in light skin increases the oxidative stress in melanocytes, and this combined with the limited ability of pheomelanin to absorb UVR contributes to higher skin cancer rates among light-skinned individuals. The damaging effect of UVR on DNA structure and the entailing elevated skin cancer risk is widely recognized. However, these cancer types usually affect people at the end or after their reproductive career and could have not been the evolutionary reason behind the development of dark skin pigmentation. Of all the major skin cancer types, only malignant melanoma have a major effect in a person's reproductive age. The mortality rates of melanoma has been very low (less than 5 per 100,000) before the mid-20th century. It {{has been argued that}} the low melanoma mortality rates during reproductive age cannot be the principal reason behind the development of dark skin pigmentation.|$|E

Results : Seventy-eight patients with tear trough deformity were confirmed from photographs taken before and after surgery. There were some complications, but all had complete resolution. Conclusions : Patients with mild to moderate peri-orbital volume loss without severe orbital fat bulging may be good candidates for hyaluronic acid filler or fat grafting alone.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} redundant <b>lower</b> eyelid <b>skin</b> on the eyelash direction in epiblepharon. Materials and methods: Asian patients with epiblepharon participated in this study. The <b>lower</b> eyelid <b>skin</b> was pulled downward in the upright position with the extent just to detach from eyelash roots, and {{the direction of the}} eyelashes was examined. These evaluations were repeated before surgery while the patients were lying supine under general anesthesia. Results: The study included 41 lower eyelids of 25 patients (17 females, 8 males, average age; 5. 6 years, 16 cases bilateral, 9 unilateral). In the upright position, without downward traction of the skin, the eyelashes were vertically positioned and touching the cornea. The redundant skin touched only the eyelash roots and had minimal contribution to eyelash inversion. With downward skin traction, there was no signifi cant change in the eyelash direction. In the spine position, the eyelashes were touching the cornea, and there was marked redundant skin that was pushing the eyelashes inward. With downward skin traction, there was no significant change. Conclusions: The direction of lower eyelashes in patients with epiblepharon was less infl uenced by <b>lower</b> eyelid <b>skin</b> redundancy than previously considered.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a two-step approach that was adopted in a collaborative multi- disciplinary work named OSYCAF for wing-box design optimization. This approach encompasses: 1) the initialization {{of a full}} parametric PCL flexible wing optimization with analytical design, and 2) the comparison of the sol 200 optimization (mass of the wing) with a simple surrogate model (also known as Reduced Order Model due to the quadratic form in the regression). Our main objective is to optimize the global structure weight while respecting all structural criteria and constraints, and using the spars and skin thickness as design variables. We show that after the optimization the importance of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>skins</b> is minimized and almost all efforts are concentrated on spars, specially the rear spar. It is also shown that the strain criterion is stronger than the stress one, which considers shear and buckling deformations as the critical design points, although fatigue is also relevant when designing the <b>lower</b> Wing-Box <b>Skin.</b> We show the results obtained for the local optimization of several considered NACA- 4 profiles by using an automated process.
