40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{presents}} {{a review of the}} published empirical and theoretical literature to date on similarities and differences in intimate partner violence (IPV) in rural <b>locales</b> compared to urban and suburban <b>locales.</b> A review of 63 studies indicates that (1) the rates of IPV are generally similar across rural, urban, and suburban <b>locales,</b> although some groups of rural women (e. g., multiracial and separated/divorced) may be at increased risk for IPV compared to similar groups of urban women, and rates of intimate partner homicide may be higher in rural <b>locales</b> than urban and suburban locales; (2) IPV perpetrator and victim characteristics in rural <b>locales</b> are generally similar to IPV perpetrator and victim characteristics in other <b>locales</b> with the exception of some demographic characteristics that can generally be accounted for by broader rural–urban–suburban demographic differences; (3) IPV perpetrators in rural <b>locales,</b> compared with perpetrators in urban <b>locales,</b> may perpetrate more chronic and severe IPV, which could be due to the higher rates of substance abuse and unemployment documented among rural perpetrators; (4) IPV victims in rural <b>locales</b> may have worse psychosocial and physical health outcomes {{due to the lack of}} availability, accessibility, and quality of IPV services; and (5) attitudes about IPV vary to some extent across <b>locales,</b> with individuals in rural <b>locales</b> generally supporting less governmental involvement in IPV issues than in urban <b>locales.</b> Limitations of the literature are reviewed and suggestions for research are provided as well as implications for practice and policy efforts, which primarily center on improving availability, accessibility, and quality of IPV services in rural <b>locales...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we define ordered Stone <b>locales.</b> These are classically just the ordered Stone spaces.

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or <b>locale</b> that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the <b>locale</b> became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

40|$|We {{present and}} study the {{category}} of formal topologies {{and some of its}} variants. Two main results are proven. The first is that, for any inductively generated formal cover, there exists a formal topology whose cover extends in the minimal way the given one. This result is obtained by enhancing the method for the inductive generation of the cover relation by adding a coinductive generation of the positivity predicate. Categorically, this result can be rephrased by saying that inductively generated formal topologies are coreflective into inductively generated formal covers. The second result is that unary formal covers are exponentiable in the category of inductively generated formal covers and hence, thanks to the coreflection, unary formal topologies are exponentiable in the category of inductively generated formal topologies. From a localic point of view the exponentiability of unary formal topologies means that algebraic dcpos are exponentiable in the category of open <b>locales.</b> But, the coreflection theorem states that open <b>locales</b> are coreflective in <b>locales</b> and hence, as a consequence of well-known impredicative results on exponentiable <b>locales,</b> it allows to prove that locally compact open <b>locales</b> are exponentiable in the category of open <b>locales...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester. In 1850, it was {{resolved}} to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming Genesee College. However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely.

The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal Díaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Next-generation {{sequencing}} technologies allow {{researchers to}} obtain millions of sequence reads {{in a single}} experiment. One important use of the technology is the sequencing of small non-coding regulatory RNAs and {{the identification of the}} genomic <b>locales</b> from which they originate. Currently, there is a paucity of methods for finding small RNA generative <b>locales.</b> Results We describe and implement an algorithm that can determine small RNA generative <b>locales</b> from high-throughput sequencing data. The algorithm creates a network, or graph, of the small RNAs by creating links between them depending on their proximity on the target genome. For each of the sub-networks in the resulting graph the clustering coefficient, a measure of the interconnectedness of the subnetwork, is used to identify the generative <b>locales.</b> We test the algorithm over a wide range of parameters using RFAM sequences as positive controls and demonstrate that the algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity in a range of Arabidopsis and mouse small RNA sequence sets and that the <b>locales</b> it generates are robust to differences in the choice of parameters. Conclusions NiBLS is a fast, reliable and sensitive method for determining small RNA <b>locales</b> in high-throughput sequence data that is generally applicable to all classes of small RNA. </p...|$|R
