5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E

500|$|A further {{announcement}} was made on 9 May 2006 about {{the sequence of events}} which caused the explosion. Starting at 19:00 on the evening of 10 December 2005, Tank 912, towards the north west of the main depot, was filled with unleaded petrolfrom the Coryton Refinery located in Essex, England. At midnight the terminal closed, and a check was made of the contents of tanks, which found everything normal. Normally the gauges monitor the level of the fuel in the tank as it fills from the particular pipeline. From about 03:00 the <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> for Tank 912 began to indicate an unchanging level reading, despite it being filled at [...] per hour.|$|E
500|$|The {{final report}} of the Major Incident Investigation Board (MIIB) was written in 2008 and {{released}} in February 2011. The investigation found that Tank 912 at the Buncefield oil storage depot was being filled with petrol. The tank had a <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being [...] "filled blind" [...] with petrol (i.e., being filled without {{a clear indication of}} the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to small-scale, hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within their respective giant robots, called gears. In gear combat, the limiting factor of AP {{is replaced by}} fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power. For these battles, [...] "deathblows" [...] may only be executed after first building up the [...] "Attack Level"—an abstract concept represented by a number in the bottom-left of the gear combat interface—through the execution of simple strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack <b>Level</b> <b>gauge.</b> There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an [...] "infinite" [...] level with {{its own set of}} deathblows. To reach [...] "Infinity Mode", a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to [...] "Infinity" [...] attacks.|$|E

The series of waves first came ashore at the North Spit station in Eureka after a 26-minute travel time, but the largest surges were seen just to the north at Crescent City and arrived close to low tide, a condition that would have lowered the risk had the surges had a destructive capacity. The first packet of energy reached that location in 47 minutes and had a maximum wave height of , and a second, larger packet arrived later with a maximum amplitude of [...] The waves were also detected to {{the south in the}} interior of San Francisco Bay at Alameda, but with a considerable delay (135 minutes after the mainshock), due to the shallow waters of the bay and the shelf surrounding the bay's entrance. The speed a tsunami travels {{is directly related to the}} depth of the water in which it is traversing. The tsunami was detected farther to the south in Monterey, for example, after just a 64-minute travel time, due to the deeper offshore waters and those in the Monterey Bay.|$|E
