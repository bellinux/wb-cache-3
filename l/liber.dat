5|$|<b>Liber</b> physiognomiae {{was written}} by the Scottish {{mathematician}} Michael Scot (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the <b>Liber</b> introductorius (The Great Introductory Book). This trilogy also includes the <b>Liber</b> quatuor distinctionum (The Book of the Four Distinctions) and the <b>Liber</b> particularis (The Singular Book).|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the <b>Liber</b> is important to historians. It is in the <b>Liber</b> that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The <b>Liber</b> is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The <b>Liber</b> describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Liber</b> was {{familiar}} to the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, who used it along with the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, Roger of Wendover, was also aware of the <b>Liber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of the <b>Liber</b> was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the <b>Liber</b> should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The <b>Liber</b> was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E

5|$|Related manuscripts include Bodleian Library Oxford MS Laud 647, {{known as}} the O manuscript. This {{is based on the}} <b>Liber,</b> but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the <b>Liber,</b> calls that and related works the Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium. Another related work is {{contained}} in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the Libellus of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register <b>Liber</b> M.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Liber</b> Eliensis {{provides}} an important {{history of the}} region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: <b>Liber</b> generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of <b>Liber</b> is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of <b>Liber</b> is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} {{found in}} the <b>Liber</b> physiognomiae {{seems to have been}} derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and Pseudo-Aristotelian works. The work was written in the early 13th century for Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, but was first officially printed in 1477. <b>Liber</b> physiognomiae would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.|$|E
5|$|The name also {{occurs in}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 501, as Bieda, one of {{the sons of the}} Saxon founder of Portsmouth. The <b>Liber</b> Vitae of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is {{possible}} that this priest is the other name listed in the <b>Liber</b> Vitae.|$|E
5|$|Three early {{registers}} of {{the dean}} and chapter of Wells– the <b>Liber</b> Albus I (White Book; R I), <b>Liber</b> Albus II (R III) and <b>Liber</b> Ruber (Red Book; R II, section i)– were edited by W. H. B. Bird for the Historical Manuscripts Commissioners {{and published in}} 1907. The books comprise, with some repetition, a cartulary of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land dating back {{as early as the}} 8th century, well before the development of hereditary surnames in England; they also comprise acts of the Dean and Chapter, and surveys of their estates, mostly in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Works more {{directly}} related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester's Libellus, large parts of which were copied into the <b>Liber</b> Eliensis. Also incorporated into the <b>Liber</b> was an earlier Vita, or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely. A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used, and the material from three surviving cartularies. These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the <b>Liber</b> itself, was a work about Hereward the Wake written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the Gesta Herwardi known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the <b>Liber</b> used the exact text of the Gesta as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, only {{sections}} of the <b>Liber</b> had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the <b>Liber</b> were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the Anglia Christiana Society in 1848. Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of Jean Mabillon's nine-volume Acta Sanctorum, printed between 1688 and 1701. Another set of extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father Thomas Gale, {{as part of his}} Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV, published at Oxford in 1691.|$|E
5|$|In 1202, Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170 – c. 1250) {{introduced}} the Fibonacci number sequence {{to the western}} world with his book <b>Liber</b> Abaci. Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical rabbit population.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Somairle's {{descendants}} in the decades following his demise. Dubgall does not appear on record until 1175, when he is attested far from the Isles in Durham, by the Durham Cathedral's <b>Liber</b> Vitae. Nothing is certain of Dubgall's later activities, {{and it is possible}} that, by the 1180s, Ragnall had begun to encroach upon Dubgall's territories and his position as head of the meic Somairle. The fact that Dubgall is not accorded any title by the <b>Liber</b> Vitae could be evidence that Ragnall had displaced him upon Somairle's demise, or that the chronicle's account of Dubgall's connection with the kingship is merely the work of thirteenth-century bias favouring the powerful meic Dubgaill, Dubgaill's descendants.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Liber</b> Eliensis {{was written}} at Ely Abbey, which became Ely Cathedral upon {{conversion}} into a bishopric in 1109. The historian Elisabeth van Houts {{believes that it}} was written in two stages: first under Bishop Hervey le Breton, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an Old English work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s. However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the <b>Liber</b> was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the <b>Liber</b> was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the <b>Liber</b> was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As {{there is no mention of}} Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Liber</b> {{covers the}} period from the {{founding}} of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during {{the latter part of the}} 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the <b>Liber</b> chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, Æthelthryth, and gifts of land to Ely.|$|E
5|$|Gale {{inherited}} his father's {{library of}} manuscripts and books, which he eventually donated to his alma mater, Trinity College, in 1738. Included in Gale's donation {{was one of}} only two complete manuscripts of the <b>Liber</b> Eliensis, now known as Trinity College MS O.2.1. Gale also collected coins, and donated his collection to Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|In 1109, a new diocese {{was created}} in England, at Ely, and Hervey was {{appointed}} to the bishopric created. While bishop, Hervey ordered the compilation of a house chronicle, which later became the <b>Liber</b> Eliensis. He supervised the construction of a causeway between Ely and Exning, which allowed easier access to Ely.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liber</b> Eliensis {{has been}} {{published}} by the Royal Historical Society in its Camden Third Series, edited by E. O. Blake. The edition contains the Latin text along with some Old English texts, but no translation. Janet Fairweather has produced a recent English translation of the Latin, published in 2005 by the Boydell Press.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A {{number of the}} stories in the narrative parts of the <b>Liber</b> resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It {{is possible that the}} information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Liber</b> {{is one of}} {{a number}} of monastic {{histories}} written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis of Abingdon Abbey, the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey, the Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense of Peterborough Abbey, a history of the see of Bath and Wells, and the Chronicon Monasterii de Bello of Battle Abbey. The northern histories record the foundation stories of the various Cistercian houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the <b>Liber</b> Eliensis, mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.|$|E
5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the <b>Liber</b> Planetis et Mundi Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the <b>Liber</b> Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The word herbal {{is derived}} from the mediaeval Latin <b>liber</b> herbalis ("book of herbs"): it is {{sometimes}} used in contrast to the word florilegium, which is a treatise on flowers with emphasis on their beauty and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility. Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of traditional medicine and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined {{to believe that the}} work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the <b>Liber,</b> suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the <b>Liber</b> specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E
