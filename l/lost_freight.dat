50|$|The railway {{line was}} built by the Hanover-Altenbeken Railway Company (Hannover-Altenbekener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, HAE). The first section opened to Hamelin on 13 April 1872 and the whole Hanover-Altenbeken line was {{completed}} on 19 December 1872. After the financial decline of the HAE, it was nationalised in 1880 and operated {{as part of the}} Prussian state railways. The originally single-track line was duplicated between Hamelin and Altenbeken in 1908 and between Hannover and Hamelin in 1913. As a result of the division of Germany after 1945 it <b>lost</b> <b>freight</b> traffic, which had been important for decades, because traffic shifted to the north-south direction. Electrical operations commenced on the line in the summer of 1971.|$|E
5000|$|Kokubo station - The 98 km line to Shibushi, also {{connecting}} to the Nichinan Line, was not completed until 1972. The first section was opened by the Osumi Light Railway Co. as a 762mm gauge line from Funama to Kushira, via a reversing station at Kanoya, between 1915 and 1923. The line was nationalised in 1935, {{the same year}} the Shibushi - Higashikushira line was opened by JR. The 1 km connection to Kushira opened the following year, and in 1938 the Kushira - Funama section was regauged, with a new station at Kanoya removing the need to reverse direction there. The Funama - Kaigata section opened in 1961 as a passenger only line, and the Kaigata - Kokubu section also opened without freight service. The rest of the line <b>lost</b> <b>freight</b> service in 1982, and the entire line closed in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|John F. Stover wrote, in {{his second}} edition of American Railroads: [...] "The giant new Penn Central system faced a variety of problems. One of Central President Stuart Saunders' aids, Allen J. Greenough, said of the {{enlarged}} line: [...] "This is a big dog {{with a lot of}} fleas.... We'll be scratching for a long time." [...] The Penn Central was official one railroad, but York Central workers tried to follow their old rules, and Pennsylvania workers did likewise. The two old lines had very different signal and computer systems. The result in 1968 and 1969 was lost waybills <b>lost</b> <b>freight</b> shipments, even one lost train. By early 1970 a major problem was having to borrow capital at eight to ten percent for a railroad earning one or two percent. Penn Central was now losing one million dollars a day. On Sunday, June 21, 1970, Penn Central filed for bankruptcy, one of the biggest business failures in United States history." ...|$|E

5000|$|The merger {{proved to}} be one of the largest debacles in {{corporate}} history. On January 1, 1969, as part of the Interstate Commerce Commission's conditions to approve the merger, the New Haven was absorbed as well. Within just two years the Penn Central became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history to that time. Adversarial management teams, poorly planned attempts to diversify away from railroading, failure to adopt a standardized computer system, years of deferred maintenance, federal regulation and federally subsidized competition (the interstate highway system, the St. Lawrence seaway), coupled with deindustrialization in the heart of the Penn Central's territory quickly overwhelmed the company. Failure to integrate the computer system alone meant the company lost waybills, <b>lost</b> <b>freight</b> cars, clogged rail yards, and freight customers, who had the option of switching to sea or truck, took their business elsewhere. The role of the New Haven remains disputed. Symes stated to Daughen and Binzen that the inclusion of the New Haven was a major factor in the collapse of Penn Central. Symes' hand-picked successor, Stuart T. Saunders, disagreed. In 1970, after two years of losses and major under-performance in freight and passenger rail operations, Penn Central announced in February 1970 that 1969 rail operations generated a loss of $56 million versus $5.1 million for the year before. Ominously, income dropped from $88 million to $4.38 million between 1968 and 1969. As a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation later noted, these reports [...] "ended confidence in its commercial paper in the financial community." ...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing firms buy {{transport}} services {{with the aim}} of minimizing their total logistics cost. There is a large amount of literature analyzing how shippers value the various characteristics of a transport service, mostly performed by collecting stated-preference data and estimating discrete choice models. Most of the empirical studies specify the deterministic part of the utility functions as linear in the observed attributes. This implicitly constrains the characteristics of the analyzed transport service to be perfect substitutes, and to have a constant substitutability ratio. Such an assumption is inconsistent with the standard microeconomic theory, typically assuming inputs’ decreasing marginal productivity, and may not be realistic. The paper tests the linearity assumption for freight rate, travel time, probability of having damaged and <b>lost</b> <b>freight,</b> frequency, flexibility, mode and punctuality on a sample of Italian small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SME). Our findings suggest that the linearity-in-the-attributes assumption should be rejected and that the marginal impact on the utility-of-profit of the attributes is not constant. More specifically travel time and freight rate produce decreasing marginal reductions of the utility-of-profit; while safety (percentage of not damaged or lost shipments) and punctuality (percentage of shipments on time) are responsible for increasing marginal contributions to the utility-of-profit. The substitutability ratios between (a) freight rate and loss and damage, (b) freight rate and travel time, (c) freight rate and punctuality, (d) travel time and damage and loss and (e) travel time and punctuality are estimated and found not constant. Finally, it is found that the willingness to pay for the qualitative attributes obtained with a linearly specified model tend to be overestimated...|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, freight trains operated over the Kaiserslautern-Homburg-Landau-Germersheim and Saarbrücken-Landau-Germersheim lines. Their customers at the station included Stabila, a local manufacturer of measuring instruments. After the Second World War <b>freight</b> traffic also <b>lost</b> importance. From the 1980s onwards, a Übergabegüterzug (goods exchange train) served the station. Its operation were based in Neustadt Hauptbahnhof. The trains ran from Landau to Wilgartswiesen. Operation of freight traffic at the station ended in 1994. Subsequently, the loading tracks at the station were disconnected and partially dismantled in 2001.

50|$|The railway {{line that}} {{passes through the}} now closed Askeaton railway station was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857. The line between Limerick and Foynes had {{stations}} at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton. The railway line to Foynes passes north of the town, but Askeaton Railway Station was closed to passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and freight on 2 December 1974, when the station closed. Trains for Foynes continued to pass through Askeaton until the line effectively <b>lost</b> all its <b>freight</b> services in 2000.

6000|$|Captain Mitchell, {{pacing the}} wharf, was asking himself the same question. There {{was always the}} doubt whether the warning of the Esmeralda telegraphist--a fragmentary and {{interrupted}} message--had been properly understood. However, the good man had {{made up his mind}} not to go to bed till daylight, if even then. He imagined himself to have rendered an enormous service to Charles Gould. When he thought of the saved silver he rubbed his hands together with satisfaction. In his simple way he was proud at being a party to this extremely clever expedient. It was he who had given it a practical shape by suggesting the possibility of intercepting at sea the north-bound steamer. And it was advantageous to his Company, too, which would have <b>lost</b> a valuable <b>freight</b> if the treasure had been left ashore to be confiscated. The pleasure of disappointing the Monterists was also very great. Authoritative by temperament and the long habit of command, Captain Mitchell was no democrat. He {{even went so far as}} to profess a contempt for parliamentarism itself. [...] "His Excellency Don Vincente Ribiera," [...] he used to say, [...] "whom I and that fellow of mine, Nostromo, had the honour, sir, and the pleasure of saving from a cruel death, deferred too much to his Congress. It was a mistake--a distinct mistake, sir." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{considerable}} {{planning and}} expenditure in 1930 {{was going into}} improving the passenger operation, it was hoped to increase revenue from the IR's freight business. Less-than-carload (LCL) overnight deliveries [...] between the various IR-linked towns (and to or from Ohio) was not available from the competing railroads; the latter typically required {{two to three days}} to complete a shipment. An example is delivering machined parts made in Terre Haute overnight to Fort Wayne auto manufacturer Auburn. Prior to 1930, cartage business already existed due to the interurban's ties to local power companies. At night the IR's arch windowed wood bodied box motors would rumble down the quiet brick streets of an Indiana town towing one or two gondolas loaded with coal for the local power plant. In some cases, freight trains operating on city streets became an objection of town councils, particularly if those trains operated during the day. Many merchants, newspapers, and small manufacturing companies used the frequent interurban scheduling provided. Had this freight business increased with an improving economy along with the greater sales generated by a motivated sales force, the IR would have had a promising future. The idea was a good one, but the national economy didn't improve. Instead, it collapsed further. When the Indiana Railroad <b>lost</b> its important <b>freight</b> interchange connection with neighboring interurban Dayton and Western (which connected at Dayton with the busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban to the Ohio towns of Toledo, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Columbus) prospects for the line's survival were poor. The C abandoned operations in early 1938 when it lost its interurban connection to Cleveland. The IR continued to barely survive with just Indiana freight business, but its lines were abandoned one by one. Today, one operation on IR track survives as the Southern Indiana Railroad between Speed and Watson Jct handling concrete from Essroc Cement for interchange with the CSX/B at Watson trains using diesel locomotives.|$|R
