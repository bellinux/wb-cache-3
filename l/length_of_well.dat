40|$|Simulations of CO 2 {{injection}} into confined saline aquifers {{were conducted}} for both {{vertical and horizontal}} injection wells. The metrics used in quantifying the performances of different injection scenarios included changes in pressure near the injection <b>well,</b> mass <b>of</b> CO 2 dissolved into brine (solubility trapping), and storage efficiency, all evaluated with an assumed injection period of 50 years. Metrics were quantified as functions <b>of</b> <b>well</b> <b>length,</b> well orientation, CO 2 injection rate, and formation anisotropy (ratio of vertical to horizontal conductivity). When equal well lengths are compared, {{there is not a}} significant difference between the predicted performances of horizontal and vertical <b>wells.</b> However, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a horizontal <b>well</b> may exceed the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a vertical <b>well</b> because the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>well</b> is not constrained to the vertical thickness of the geologic formation. Simulations show that, as the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>well</b> is allowed to increase, the geologic formation can receive a significantly higher CO 2 injection rate without exceeding a maximum allowable pressure. This result is observed in both isotropic and anisotropic formations, and suggests that horizontal wells may be advantageous under pressure-limited conditions. However, the use <b>of</b> horizontal <b>wells</b> does not significantly improve the storage efficiency, and under strongly anisotropic conditions, a vertical well provides higher storage efficiency than a horizontal well. We conclude that horizontal wells may be preferable if the goal is to sequester a large amount of CO 2 in a short period of time, but do not offer a significant advantage in terms of long-term capacity of a potential repository...|$|R

A recombinant 3 D 7 form of MSP 2 was a subunit of Combination B, a blood stage vaccine {{tested in the}} field in Papua New Guinea. A selective effect in favour of the allelic family not represented by the vaccine argued for a MSP 2 vaccine consisting of both dimorphic variants. An alternative approach to recombinant manufacture of vaccines is the production of long synthetic peptides (LSP). LSP exceeding a <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>well</b> over 100 amino acids can now be routinely synthesized. Synthetic production of vaccine antigens cuts the often time-consuming steps of protein expression and purification short. This considerably reduces the time for a candidate to reach the phase of clinical trials. Here we present the evaluation of two long synthetic peptides representing both allelic families of MSP 2 as potential vaccine candidates. The constructs were well recognized by human immune sera from different locations and different age groups. Furthermore, peptide-specific antibodies in human immune sera were associated with protection from clinical malaria. The synthetic fragments share major antigenic properties with native MSP 2. Immunization of mice with these antigens yielded high titre antibody responses and monoclonal antibodies recognized parasite-derived MSP 2. Our results justify taking these candidate poly-peptides into further vaccine developmen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to density {{difference}} between injected CO 2 and in-situ brine, the pressure {{difference between}} wellbore and formation varies with depth in a CO 2 injection well. Consequently the flux distribution along a vertical well is not uniform {{during the early}} stages of injection. For injection rates below a certain threshold, this can lead to {{only a fraction of the}} perforations contributing to injection. Generally this reduces the efficiency of CO 2 immobilization by dissolution in brine and by residual trapping because less volume of rock and brine comes in contact with injected CO 2. Thus for injection rates below the threshold, optimization of the length of the perforated interval is required to maximize trapping. We describe a semi-analytical algorithm that finds the optimum interval of injection for a given flow rate so that all the perforations contribute throughout the injection period. Although bottomhole pressure rises while injecting in smaller perforation interval, the greater mobility of the CO 2 phase upstream of the drying front reduces this increase and enables the use of smaller interval. In the case of a horizontal well, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>well</b> plays an important role in determining the CO 2 trapping. The two competing effects, trapping along the well length and along lateral direction, determine the optimum well length required. Greater well length increases the trapping in direction of well path but reduces in lateral direction because of the ratio of gravity forces to viscous forces becomes larger. Thus dominance of either of these competing effects and cost of drilling determine optimal well length. This study illustrates the effect of different injection strategies on multiple objectives of CO 2 sequestration including maximizing trapping and minimizing leakage potential. We find that the benefits of a strategy to maximize injectivity may be offset by less CO 2 entering secure modes of storage...|$|E

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationThe {{need for}} enhanced natural gas production is made evident by the increasingly {{large percentage of}} the electrical power that is produced from this source (at present 25 %). While this resource can be extracted from a number of sources, many of the new fields have a high decline rate, and thus increasingly unconventional sources must be developed. One such source is the natural gas found within coal beds. This Coal Bed Methane (CBM) provides only a limited reserve if the wells sunk down to the coal are drilled completely vertically, since production is a function <b>of</b> the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> that is exposed to the producing formation, since the seams of coal are often relatively thin. Where horizontal wells are drilled along the coal seam, and providing that the drill remains in the coal during the entire <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well,</b> much higher production levels can be achieved. Missouri S&T, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory, pioneered the use of high pressure water-jets for drilling such holes, and collaborated with the University of Queensland in demonstrating that wells could be drilled out to at least a kilometer in distance. Such wells also provide a path for the subsequent injection of steam and air with controlling bounding of the site, to allow the in-situ combustion of those shallow coal seams that are too thin to be mined conventionally. The producer gas generated by drilling two horizontal wells adjacent to one another (one for injection and one for extraction) can then be utilized in a surface power plant, without the environmental costs of conventional mining...|$|R
