25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, {{it is more than}} likely that the grant is a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate.</b> If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|R
25|$|Only the executor(s) of a Will {{can apply}} for a <b>Grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate.</b> It {{is the duty of}} the executor(s) of the will to obtain probate in a timely manner.

50|$|William gave {{evidence}} for his brother, admitting the frauds and forgeries {{and his own}} perjury in the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> <b>of</b> his father's estate.

50|$|Malory died on 14 March 1471 and {{was buried}} in Christ Church Greyfriars, near Newgate Prison. His interment there {{suggests}} that his misdeeds (whatever they really amounted to) had been forgiven and that he possessed some wealth. However, it was certified at the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> that he owned little wealth of his own, having settled his estate on his son in 1462.|$|R
5000|$|Probate courts {{administer}} proper {{distribution of}} the assets of a decedent (one who has died), adjudicates the validity of wills, enforces the provisions of a valid will (by issuing the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate),</b> prevents malfeasance by executors and administrators of estates, and provides for the equitable {{distribution of the}} assets of persons who die intestate (without a valid will), such as by <b>granting</b> a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> administration giving judicial approval to the personal representative to administer matters of the estate.|$|R
50|$|Shee opened Richard's case by {{presenting}} {{the background of}} the Roupell family property, William's financial difficulties and the alleged facts of the frauds and forgeries. Shee argued that the will must be a forgery as, purporting to be witnessed by William, William could not have been present to witness its execution on the said date. Shee called William who admitted the frauds and forgeries and his own perjury in the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> <b>of</b> his father's estate. It was to have been Waite's defence that William was colluding with his brother Richard, possibly in return for some compensation, but the defence was never heard as the case settled, dividing the value of the estate between Waite and Richard Roupell.|$|R

In June 1980 when Sanjay Gandhi died, his widow Menka Gandhi filed a petition for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate,</b> which was contested. Then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi engaged Anand in this case. Anand fought successfully before both the District Judge of Delhi and the Single Bench/Division Bench of the Delhi High Court.|$|R

50|$|A {{stamp duty}} was first {{introduced}} in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper for 10 years, towards carrying on the war against France (5 & 6 Will. & Mar. c. 21). The duty ranged between 1 penny to several shillings {{on a number of}} different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> honour, <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> and letters <b>of</b> administration. It raised around £50,000 a year and although it was initially a temporary measure, it proved so successful that its use was continued.|$|R
2500|$|The {{persons who}} are {{actually}} given the job {{of dealing with the}} deceased's assets are called [...] "personal representatives" [...] or [...] "PRs". If the deceased left a valid will, the PRs are the [...] "executors" [...] appointed by the will—"I appoint X and Y to be my executors etc." [...] If there is no will or if the will does not contain a valid appointment of executors (for example if they are all dead) then the PRs are called [...] "administrators". So, executors obtain a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of executors and administrators is exactly the same.|$|R
25|$|The <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> is {{the first}} step in the legal process of {{administering}} the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator's (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|R

5000|$|Despite losing on {{all counts}} over a {{four-year}} period at the Royal Courts of Justice in London against the Executor to his late brother's Estate, his legal campaign still continued in Belgium against the beneficiary, with a hearing held at the Ghent Court of First Instance on 13 November 2012. Judgement was handed down on 19 December 2012 with the Court ruling {{that it was not}} within their competence to rule on such issues. <b>Grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> was sealed at the Royal Courts of Justice in England on 10 October 2012 by the Executor, which did little to assist Davies with his Belgian campaign. When discussing another Anglo-Belgian case on the British Democracy Forum on 16 September 2011, Davies (who posts under the nom-de-plume [...] "Advocatus Diaboli" [...] on the forum) remarked [...] "the Belgian courts will readily enforce English judgments, just as we enforce theirs".Davies has been ordered to pay the costs in Belgium of his uncle, the beneficiary.|$|R
50|$|The provinces {{have moved}} {{in recent years to}} convert fees for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> letters <b>probate</b> and letters <b>of</b> {{administration}} from flat rates to ones based on the value of the estate. In 1992, Ontario introduced fees at a level higher than in any other province. The Supreme Court of Canada declared that the method by which it was introduced was unconstitutional, as its basis had not been the subject of appropriate legislation.|$|R
25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing <b>of</b> a foreign <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> or letters <b>of</b> administration.|$|R
5000|$|He {{had married}} Sybil Marguerite Gonne, OBE, {{daughter}} of the eighth Baron de Hochepied Larpent, in 1899, but died childless, and his death occasioned the selling-off {{of much of the}} vast Kingsweston estate which extended to over 9000 acre. Through his marriage, he was brother-in-law of Colonel Robert Charles Goff and George Percy Jacomb-Hood. Even after giving so much in philanthropic acts during his life, the <b>Grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>Probate</b> for his Will shows that he still had personal estate worth £286,422 11s 4d (£87,561,390 in 2008 terms). His estate was dealt with by his executors who included his cousin, William StJohn Fenton Miles, a Director of the National Provincial Bank which, by now, had taken over the family's original bank, Miles & Co. His ashes are buried at Henbury parish church, and his grave is marked by the punning family motto [...] "Labora siccut bonus miles": 'Work like a good soldier.' He is commemorated in the name of Napier Miles Road, leading to the gate of Kingsweston (Kings Weston House).|$|R
60|$|That evening Harold came {{round to}} visit me at my rooms. I {{could see he was}} much agitated. Things had gone very badly. Lady Georgina was there; she had stopped to dine with me, dear old thing, lest I should feel lonely and give way; so had Elsie Petheridge. Mr. Elworthy sent a {{telegram}} of welcome from Devonshire. I knew at least that my friends were rallying round me in this hour of trial. The kind Maharajah himself would have come too, if I had allowed him, but I thought it inexpedient. They explained everything to me. Harold had propounded Mr. Ashurst's will--the one I drew up at Florence--and had asked for probate. Lord Southminster intervened and opposed the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> on the ground that the signatures were forgeries. He propounded instead another will, drawn some twenty years earlier, when they were both children, duly executed at the time, and undoubtedly genuine; in it, testator left everything without reserve to the eldest son of his eldest brother, Lord Kynaston.|$|R
50|$|Where a will {{has been}} lost or destroyed, but a copy or draft is in existence, the court, if {{satisfied}} that the testator {{did not intend to}} revoke the will, may authorise the Master to <b>grant</b> <b>probate</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
40|$|The ecclesiastical courts at Canterbury {{have left}} a {{magnificent}} set of records many of them still largely unexplored. The seventeenth century collection includes examples of almost every type of material and the series of Act books are almost complete. They reveal a proud and highly trained ecclesiastical bureaucracy in this diocese which was almost certainly less corrupt than elsewhere and who provided a much wider and more efficient service than the nickname "the bawdy courts" implied. Undoubtedly they did attempt, not always very successfully, to discipline the morals of the Church's members but Instance business, the hearing of cases between party and party, and the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> occupied a very large proportion of their time. In these spheres they provided an effective service the need for which was confirmed by the very small amount of interference they experienced from the Common law courts. While {{it is true that}} the diocese had advantages which made it unique, in that it covered a small area and had a special relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, a study of the organisation and procedure of these courts can nevertheless be very valuable. It shows the church courts working in a way which was presumably closer than elsewhere to the ideal envisaged by the Church and so helps to explain the character and scope of post-Reformation ecclesiastical jurisdiction. <p...|$|R

25|$|The High Court {{exercises}} both original jurisdiction and {{appellate jurisdiction}} in {{civil and criminal}} matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance; in other words, it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed S$60,000. If a plaintiff commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on contract, tort or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more costs – legal expenses payable to her by the defendant – than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing <b>of</b> a foreign <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>probate</b> or letters <b>of</b> administration.|$|R
