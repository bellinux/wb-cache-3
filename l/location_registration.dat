40|$|A Personal Communication Network (PCN) {{location}} tracking scheme called “local anchoring ” is introduced which reduces the signaling cost {{as compared to}} the location strategy proposed in the IS- 41 standard. Local anchoring minimizes the number of <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> messages between the home location register (HLR) and the visitor location registeras (VLRs) in a way that location change is reported to a nearby VLR called the local anchor (LA) instead of to the HLR. This method successfully reduces the cost for {{location tracking}} when the call arrival rate is low relative to the mobility rate and the cost for <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> is high. A dynamic local anchoring mechanism is then introduced which dynamically selects the LA such that the expected cost for <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> and call delivery is minilnized.

40|$|Abstract—Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is a {{new technology}} for object identification/tracking systems. In this paper, we propose a novel RFID location management system: SIP-based RFID management system (SRMS). SRMS employs session initiation protocol (SIP), which is an Internet standard protocol for session management and mobility support. SRMS enhances the existing SIP architecture by introducing a surrogate user agent (SUA) and an SRMS name server (SNS). The SUA performs <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> procedures on behalf of RFID tags with limited capabilities, while the SNS provides name resolution services for location registration/tracking of RFID tags. To evaluate the <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> latency in SRMS, we carry out performance analysis based on queueing models.

40|$|Abstract. Signaling {{overhead}} incurred in {{location management}} be-comes significant in PCS (Personal Communication Systems), especially with many users of high mobility. In such cases, an efficient location management scheme {{plays an important}} role in signaling. In this paper, we propose a new location management strategy which is based on the centralized database architecture with HLR/VLR concept. Our main idea is to reduce the number of location registrations by grouping MTs (Mobile Terminals) with a similar velocity and the same moving direction. Our scheme can reduce the total signaling cost of location management by reducing the cost of <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> more than the increased cost of call delivery. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms current methods in <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> cost as long as CMR (call to mobility ratio) is not high and has a superior performance in the total signaling cost with low CMR and high population. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a dynamic hierarchical database architecture for location management in personal communications service (PCS) networks. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic adjustments of user location information distribution {{based on the}} mobility and calling patterns of the mobile terminals (MT’s). A unique distribution strategy is determined for each MT, and location pointers are set up at selected remote locations which indicate the current location of the MT’s. This method effectively reduces the signaling and database access overhead for <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> and call delivery. Besides, the required processing is handled by a distributed network of directory registers and centralized coordination is not necessary. The functions of the other network elements, such as the home location register (HLR) and the visitor location registers (VLR’s), remain primarily unchanged. This greatly facilitates the deployment of this scheme in current PCS networks.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in location management {{for dealing with}} user mobility in wireless networks {{is to reduce the}} cost associated with location updates and searches. The former operation occurs when a mobile user moves to a new <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> area and the network is being informed of the mobile user's current location; the latter operation occurs when there is a call for the mobile user and the network must deliver the call to the mobile user. In this paper, we propose and analyze a class of new agent-based forwarding schemes with the objective to reduce the location management cost in mobile wireless networks. We develop analytical models to compare the performance of the proposed schemes with existing location management schemes to demonstrate their feasibility and also to reveal conditions under which our proposed schemes are superior to existing ones.

The numerical results obtained with the proposed SMP model are compared with those from previous models.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new hashing and caching {{strategy}} (NHC) {{in order to}} reduce the overall location management cost in wireless mobile networks. It uses caches whose up-to-date information is responsible for dropping this cost and these caches are updated not only at call arrival time from the calling Mobile Terminals (MTs) but also at call receiving time to those MTs, and even at <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> time. To achieve load balancing among replicated Home Location Registers (HLRs), hashing technique is used and this load is also affected by the up-to-date cache information. The analytical modeling and numerical results show that our proposed method more frequently prepares the caches with up-to-date information with the increase of average call arrival rate, average call receiving rate, and even with MT’s increased mobility rate. This increases the probability of finding called MT’s location as well as hit ratio in the caches. As a result, the overall location management cost including load on a particular location server (HLR) are minimized considerably than all other previous approaches.

40|$|In {{next-generation}} wireless systems, one of {{the major}} features that is different from the current personal communication service systems is the seamless global roaming. The mobile subscribers will be allowed to move freely across different networks while maintaining their quality of service for a variety of applications.

In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed, emphasizing the active <b>location</b> <b>registration</b> for ongoing services during the mobile subscribers ’ movement. Another important goal of this new protocol is to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management so that the signaling traffic load and consumption of network resources can be reduced.

The numerical results reveal that the proposed protocol is effective in improving the overall system performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{scheme is}} {{developed}} for optimal location area design in wireless systems. New algorithms based on intercell traffic prediction and traffic-based cell grouping {{are used to}} select the optimal set of cells for location areas (LAs). The expected intercell movement patterns of mobiles are determined by using the new intercell traffic prediction algorithm. Further, the cells are partitioned into LAs by applying the new traffic-based cell grouping algorithm where the cell pairs with higher intercell mobile traffic are grouped into the same LA. Hence, the inter-LA mobile traffic is decreased by increasing the intra-LA mobile traffic. Experimental results show that this cell grouping algorithm reduces the number of location updates by 27 percent to 36 percent on average compared to proximity-based cell grouping schemes.
