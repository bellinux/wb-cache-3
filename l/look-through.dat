50|$|Foreign {{personal}} {{holding company}} income (FPHCI) is defined for U.S. controlled foreign corporation rules and, with modifications, for U.S. foreign tax credit rules. It consists of interest, dividends, rents, royalties, gains on property producing FPHCI, and certain other items. Exceptions are provided for active rents and royalties, certain related party rents and royalties, same country income, and certain other items. For {{purposes of the}} foreign tax credit, an additional exception requires <b>look-through</b> of certain income received from a controlled foreign corporation.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the <b>look-through</b> approach, PRIMA {{does not}} look through the various tiers of {{intermediaries}} to the underlying securities. Rather, it stops {{at the level of}} the intermediary immediately above the parties to the pledge or transfer. Its important advantage is that it subjects an investor's interest in securities to the law of a single jurisdiction, even where evidence of underlying securities is situated in many different countries, or where various issuers in a single portfolio is involved. This provides certainty and clarity for all parties involved.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2010, {{as part of}} the 2010 New Zealand budget, Loss Attributing Qualifying Companies (LAQCs) were abolished.LAQCs {{had been}} popular among {{property}} investors.

In December 2010, new legislation was introduced which approved a new type of companies—or rather, a new kind of taxation structure for companies in the vein of the old LAQCs. These were to be called <b>Look-Through</b> Companies. The draft law was published yet on 15 October 2010, and successfully passed one and a half months later.

50|$|A <b>Look-Through</b> Company is {{the same}} as the {{traditional}} limited liability company, established in accordance with the New Zealand Companies Act of 1993; However, the laws differ regarding the taxation of the company's income. An LTC is unlike a typical company in that the income and expenditure of the company are expressly in the hands of the shareholders. In fiscal terms, this creates a transparent mechanism that is identical to the New Zealand limited partnership. In notable contrast to the former rules regarding LAQCs, LTC shareholders have an obligation to pay taxes on the profit of the company personally, as well as being able to claim losses generated by the company against their other income for tax purposes.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{indirect}} holding system, securities are held through fungible accounts (omnibus accounts). Under such a system, {{there is no}} record of an individual investor's interest in respect of the securities {{at the level of the}} issuer's or intermediary's register, other than the intermediary with whom the investor has a direct relationship. Thus, if the investor, or a person such as a collateral taker asserting a claim against the investor's interest were to try to enforce that claim at any of these higher levels, the response would be that no record exists of any interest against which the claim could be pursued. This problem demonstrates that any attempt to apply the <b>look-through</b> approach under a fungible custody structure runs counter to the widespread conflict of laws principle that jurisdiction over proprietary aspects of dispositions of movable property should broadly be attributed to the jurisdiction where orders in respect of that property are capable of being enforced.|$|E

[...] New Zealand provides overseas investors with foreign trusts and <b>look-through</b> companies. New Zealand government policy is to not request disclosure of the identity of either the settlor or the beneficiaries of the trust, and thus the ownership remains secret, and as a consequence, thus hiding the assets from the trust-holder's home jurisdictions. These trusts are not taxed in New Zealand. These trusts can then be used to acquire and own New Zealand registered companies, which become a vehicle by which the trust owners can exercise day to day control over their assets. These New Zealand-registered companies can be designed not to make a profit using loans from tax havens and other profit shifting techniques: the result being tax free income with the general respectability that has typically been associated with companies registered in New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|Opponents of {{explicit}} in‡ation targeting (including ex-Chairman Greenspan) {{have argued that}} a commitment to a numerical in‡ation target reduces the policy’s ‡exibility, and may hence increase output volatility. Our paper demonstrates that this claim may fail {{to account for the}} anchoring e¤ect {{of explicit}} targets on expectations and wages (that has been established empirically in various studies). This is done in a novel, more dynamic game theoretic framework that incorporates the concept of ‘economically rational expectations’by making the frequency of players’moves (both the private sector’s and the central banker’s) endogenous. We show that under an explicit long-term in-‡ation target and costly processing information/wage resetting, the public may …nd it optimal to <b>look-through</b> shocks and alter expectations and wages only infrequently. Due to such ‘rational inattention’, wages and expectations will be anchored at the target level, whereby the more explicit the target the stonger the anchoring. This is shown to make the policymaker’s short-term interest rate instrument more e¤ective in stabilization, giving it greater leverage over the real rate. As a consequence, an explicit in‡ation target improves the variability tradeo¤, ie it makes both in‡ation and output less variable in equilibrium. Our analysis thus adds another dimension to the ‘rule vs discretion debate’by showing that a long-run rule may be compatible with (and in fact enhance the e¤ectiveness of) short-run discretion. It further o¤ers several insights about the role of transparency and communication in the magnitude of the bene…cial anchoring e¤ect, and about the relationship between in‡ation targeting and central bank independence. We conclude by showing that our results are empirically supported...|$|E
40|$|<b>Look-through</b> {{mutagenesis}} (LTM) is {{a multidimensional}} mutagenesis method that simultaneously assesses and optimizes combinatorial mutations of selected amino acids. The process {{focuses on a}} precise distribution within one or more complementarity determining region (CDR) domains and explores the synergistic contribution of amino acid side-chain chemistry. LTM was applied to an anti-TNF-α antibody, D 2 E 7, which is a challenging test case, because D 2 E 7 was highly optimized (Kd = 1 nM) by others. We selected and incorporated nine amino acids, representative of the major chemical functionalities, individually at every position in each CDR and across all six CDRs (57 aa). Synthetic oligonucleotides, each introducing one amino acid mutation throughout the six CDRs, were pooled to generate segregated libraries containing single mutations in one, two, and/or three CDRs for each VH and VL domain. Corresponding antibody libraries were displayed on the cell surface of yeast. After positive binding selection, 38 substitutions in 21 CDR positions were identified that resulted in higher affinity binding to TNF-α. These beneficial mutations in both VH and VL were represented in two combinatorial beneficial mutagenesis libraries and selected by FACS to produce a convergence of variants that exhibit between 500 - and 870 -fold higher affinities. Importantly, these enhanced affinities translate to a 15 - to 30 -fold improvement in in vitro TNF-α neutralization in an L 929 bioassay. Thus, this LTM/combinatorial beneficial mutagenesis strategy generates a comprehensive energetic map of the antibody-binding site in a facile and rapid manner and should be broadly applicable to the affinity maturation of antibodies and other proteins...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of an {{unprecedented}} global financial crisis, {{one of the fundamental}} questions preoccupying policymakers and students of financial regulation worldwide is 2 ̆ 2 How did we get here? 2 ̆ 2 This Article uncovers and analyzes an important part of our recent regulatory history, which provides a key to understanding some of the deeper, hidden causes of the crisis but whose significance legal scholars have so far failed to appreciate. The Article examines interpretive letters issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the primary regulator of federally chartered U. S. banks, interpreting the National Bank Act of 1863 to allow banks to trade and deal in derivatives, potentially complex and risky financial instruments once famously characterized by Warren Buffet as 2 ̆ 2 financial weapons of mass destruction. 2 ̆ 2 The Article argues that, between the mid- 1980 s and the end of 2008, the OCC utilized three principal tools of interpreting the statutory language to authorize bank derivatives activities: the 2 ̆ 2 <b>look-through,</b> 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 7 functional equivalency, 2 ̆ 2 and, finally, the most radically expansive 2 ̆ 2 elastic definition 2 ̆ 2 approach. In these interpretive letters, the OCC articulated an excessively broad definition of the statutory concept of the 2 ̆ 2 business of banking 2 ̆ 2 to mean all types of financial intermediation and dealing in all forms of financial risk. The Article further argues that the OCC 2 ̆ 7 s highly expansive interpretation of the 2 ̆ 2 business of banking 2 ̆ 2 in the context of bank derivatives activities served to undermine the integrity and efficacy of the U. S. system of bank regulation. Through the seemingly routine and often nontransparent administrative actions, the OCC effectively enabled large U. S. commercial banks to transform themselves from the traditionally conservative deposit-taking and lending institutions, whose safety and soundness were guarded through statutory and regulatory restrictions on potentially risky activities, into a new breed of financial 2 ̆ 2 superintermediaries, 2 ̆ 2 or wholesale dealers in pure financial risk. By indirectly removing most of the restrictions on activities of commercial banks, the OCC 2 ̆ 7 s interpretive efforts had an ironic effect of prolonging the life of an obsolete statute and potentially impeding legislative reforms necessary to bring the regulatory framework in line with the changing business and risk profile of modern financial institutions...|$|E
