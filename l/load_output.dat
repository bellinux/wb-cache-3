The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions.

50|$|All {{signals from}} the drives are TTL-buffered and have 150 ohm pullups. Maxi and mini signals are wired and at the pullup side of the buffers. Signals, which {{do not apply to}} the mini (i.e., READY and SEP CLOCK), are {{disabled}} and pulled high when the mini is selected. Signals to the drives from the 1771 are TTL-buffered with separate buffers for mini and maxi connectors. The STEP output is stretched by IC37 to about 16 microseconds before going to the drives. The HLD (head <b>load)</b> <b>output</b> does not go directly to the drives but rather enables the drive select lines through IC10 pin 1. Thus, the actual drive select signal to the drive is the coincidence of a latched drive selection (done at port 34H) and HLD from the 1771. Head loading time is determined by counters IC36 and 27. Timeout is controlled by the count loaded into lC3's by IC53. Signals DRQ, HLD, and INTRQ (or EOJ) are available at input port 34H (rC9). Various control signals are assigned to output port 34H and are latched by rcs 24 and 41.|$|E

As such, this paper wants to broaden the range of approaches in structural design. status: publishe...|$|E
