2500|$|The canal {{obtained}} its Act of Parliament on 24 March 1763, {{but it did}} {{not contain}} proper provision for raising the capital needed to build the canal. Money could only be borrowed against the expected tolls, and this caused difficulties. On 30 May, the commissioners tried to find someone willing to lend £14,000, in return for all of the tolls. A year later, they tried to raise £12,000 in transferable shares of £100 each, but the uptake on these was slow. However, by 13 February 1765, the full amount had been subscribed, and Grundy was engaged as Chief Engineer at a salary of £300 per year. He employed James Hogard as resident engineer, and work began in March. By mid-1767, the outfall sluice and lock at Tetney Haven had been completed, as had the first [...] of cut. The cut was of sufficient depth that water levels were around [...] below the land surface, so that the navigation could act as a <b>land</b> <b>drain</b> as well as a canal. The first [...] from Tetney Haven to Fire Beacon Lane were opened in May 1767. Hogard then took over from Grundy as Chief Engineer, at a salary of £140 per year, and began the construction of the final section including seven locks. Additional subscriptions had to be found to fund the work, but eventually the navigation reached Riverhead basin at Louth, and a formal opening was held in May 1770. The total cost was £27,500.|$|E

50|$|The River Windrush flows {{past the}} village and with its {{tributary}} Medley Brook it forms much of the eastern boundary of the parish. The western boundary has been subject to changes and disputes in past centuries. It now follows Brighthampton Cut, an artificial <b>land</b> <b>drain</b> dug in the 19th century. The Windrush joins the River Thames at Newbridge just over 1 mi to the south.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>land</b> <b>drains</b> in {{building}} construction is somewhat different. If voids are {{created in the}} ground for any reason they tend to fill with water. Also the static loads on any subterranean structure and retaining walls can be massively increased {{by the presence of}} water in the surrounding ground. <b>Land</b> <b>drains</b> are introduced to relieve this pressure. Traditionally, the drains were created by backfilling behind retaining walls etc. with rubble and allowing the water to drain through the rubble to some suitable point.|$|R
50|$|A French drain or weeping tile (also blind drain, rubble drain, rock drain, drain tile, {{perimeter}} drain, <b>land</b> <b>drain,</b> French ditch, sub-surface drain, sub-soil drain or agricultural drain) is {{a trench}} filled with gravel or rock or containing a perforated pipe that redirects surface water and groundwater {{away from an}} area. A French drain can have perforated hollow pipes along the bottom (see images) to quickly vent water that seeps down through the upper gravel or rock.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>land</b> <b>drain</b> is to allow water in wet or swampy ground to rapidly drain away or to relieve {{hydrostatic}} pressure. They are subterranean linear structures which are laid to a fall which should be as steep as practicable. They are used in agriculture and in building construction sites. Modern land drains {{take the form of}} a perforated or discontinuous (i.e. open-jointed) pipe. Typically, the land drains conduct the surplus water to an open ditch or natural water source.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>land</b> <b>drain</b> in Holland Fen (as {{distinct}} from the River Witham, {{which is designed to}} carry water past the fens without being part of them) is known as the North Forty Foot Drain. That of the Black Sluice fens is the South Forty-Foot Drain. The latter flows, with some pump assistance, from Bourne North Fen, close to the River Glen, to the Haven at Boston. The North Forty Foot joins the South Forty Foot in the western outskirts of Boston and together their waters enter the Haven through the Black Sluice.|$|E

5000|$|A {{catchwater drain}} is a <b>land</b> <b>drain,</b> a ditch {{cut across the}} fall of the land, {{typically}} just above the level of low-lying, level ground such as The Fens of eastern England, where some land, tens of kilometres from the sea is at about sea level. Its purpose is to gather water draining from the higher, sloping ground before it reaches the flat land whence it would be difficult or expensive to remove. The water may be on the surface, in streams or in the ground before it is gathered, perhaps to be led away across the lowland by an embanked river.|$|E
50|$|The Kesteven-Holland {{boundary}} {{is formed}} by the South Forty-Foot Drain, the main <b>land</b> <b>drain</b> of the Black Sluice Level. The present layout of the drainage dates from the Act of Parliament of 1765 but {{this part of the}} South Forty-foot is a re-use of one of the main drains of the Lindsey Level, a scheme which was declared complete in 1638. On the other side, in Pinchbeck North Fen, the road begins to wind, something quite unusual in these fens. It was laid out on the bank of a soak dike called the Weir Dike, which was cut in about 1600. In Pinchbeck North Fen, the dike is now largely defunct. The instructions stipulated that it should be at a distance of 100 feet (33M) from the bank of the River Glen. As the river bank meandered a little, so the road does(13).|$|E

40|$|An archaeological strip, map {{and sample}} {{excavation}} was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology in July 2014 at Land at Dunkeswell Airfield, Devon, whereby Areas 1, 2, 3 and 4 were machine excavated. The strip, map and sample excavation identified an extensive series of sixteen pits and a ditch within Areas 1 and 3, {{likely to have}} been excavated for the extraction of iron ore nodules which are known to occur within the natural clay with flint and chert, having been previously identified on sites elsewhere within the Blackdown Hills. These features remain undated. No archaeological features or deposits were found within Areas 2 and 4. Area 4 was extended approximately 1 metre west within the north-west of the trench in order to fully investigate a linear feature found within. The linear feature was identified to be a modern <b>land</b> <b>drain.</b> The Site had recently been ploughed and a suspect Second World War UXO was identified approximately 10 m east of Area 3. The suspect UXO was identified as a non-explosive practice bomblet and deemed safe for removal and removed safely by Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit Plymouth...|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of having}} open ditches {{at the side}} of highways, <b>land</b> <b>drains</b> can be installed. The {{excavated}} trenches are completely filled with gravel (i.e., no soil cover). This is far safer than open trenches if a vehicle should run off the highway.|$|R

50|$|Inadequate land drainage:The {{water from}} the gutters {{overflows}} on to the avenues and pathways of the estate.

50|$|Threats to {{the forests}} include: mining, rubber harvesting, and {{clearing}} of forest for oil palm and coconut plantations. <b>Land</b> <b>draining</b> has also opened {{a great deal}} of space in these forests.

50|$|Holes or gaps {{have to be}} left in {{the pipes}} to allow water to {{transfer}} from the subsoil to the pipe and these tend to block with soil or allow silt into the pipe, so blocking it or reducing the flow of water. This can be partially overcome by surrounding the pipes with gravel. However, with time even the gravel becomes choked with soil/silt, so in the latest practice, the gravel is surrounded with a geotextile material which filters out soil particles. Ideally, <b>land</b> <b>drains</b> are laid with access points so that high pressure water jetting is possible to clear silt. However, whatever the technology, all <b>land</b> <b>drains</b> have a finite life and eventually become ineffective due to the ingress of silt and/or the blocking of the surrounding filter media.|$|R
