40|$|Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an {{important}} nosocomial and community-associated pathogen. Recently, livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has emerged and disseminated in Europe and North America and now constitutes a considerable zoonotic burden in humans with risk factors of pig exposure, whereas {{the extent of the}} <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir</b> is relatively unknown on other continents. Methodology/Principal Findings: From March through April 2011, MRSA was identified in pigs from 3 out of 30 production holdings in Chang Mai Province, Thailand. Representative isolates were subjected to molecular characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility testing; all isolates had genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of LA-MRSA previously characterized in the region: they belonged to ST 9, lacked the lukF-lukS genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and were resistant to multiple non-b-lactam antimicrobials. However, unlike other Asian LA-MRSA-ST 9 variants, they were spa type t 337 and harbored a different staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IX. Conclusions/Significance: A novel MRSA-ST 9 lineage has been established in the pig population of Thailand, which differs substantially from LA-MRSA lineages found {{in other areas of the}} continent.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review was to provide an up-to-date account of the interventions used to prevent the introduction of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from the expanding community and <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into hospitals in the USA, Denmark, The Netherlands and Western Australia. A {{review of existing literature}} and local guidelines for the management of MRSA in hospitals was performed. In Denmark, The Netherlands and Western Australia, where the prevalence of MRSA is relatively low, targeted admission screening and isolation of predefined high-risk populations have been used for several decades to successfully control MRSA in the hospital. Furthermore, in Denmark and The Netherlands, all identified MRSA carriers undergo routine decolonisation, whereas only carriers of particularly transmissible or virulent MRSA clones are subjected to decolonisation in Western Australia. In the USA, which continues to be a high-prevalence MRSA country, policies vary by state and even by hospital, and whilst guidelines from professional organisations provide a framework for infection control practices, these guidelines lack the authority of a legislative mandate. In conclusion, the changing epidemiology of MRSA, exemplified by the recent emergence of MRSA in the community and in food animals, makes it increasingly difficult to accurately identify specific high-risk groups to screen for MRSA carriage. Understanding the changing epidemiology of MRSA in a local as well as global context is fundamental to prevent the introduction of MRSA into hospitals.

40|$|Background: The {{expansion}} of sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. rhodesiense) beyond its traditional focus in southeast Uganda, {{has been linked}} with large-scale livestock restocking. To assess the risk presented to the human population by domestic livestock, human-infective T. b. rhodesiense must be distinguished from non-human-infective T. b. brucei, since both parasites can be present in cattle. We investigated {{the use of a}} simple genetic marker to characterize the parasites collected from cattle in villages within the new sleeping sickness focus in Soroti District, Uganda. Methods: 70 T. brucei sl samples of known human infectivity status collected from human beings and cattle in Tororo District, Uganda, from 1989 to 1991 were screened for the presence of the human serum-resistance-associated (SRA) gene by conventional PCR. In 2000 - 01, blood samples from 200 randomly selected cattle in 6 villages and 2 markets in Soroti District were screened for T. brucei sl parasites (i. e., both T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense) by PCR; positive samples were screened for the presence of the SRA gene. Findings: The SRA gene was present in all 29 samples from patients with sleeping sickness in Tororo District. Of the 41 samples collected from cattle at the same time, the SRA gene was present in the 8 samples that tested resistant to human serum in vitro, whereas it was absent from all 33 isolates that were sensitive to human serum in vitro. Of the 200 cattle sampled in Soroti District, we estimated that up to 18 % (95 % CI 12 - 23) were infected with T. b. rhodesiense. Interpretation: Detection of the SRA gene could provide the basis for a simple diagnostic test to enable targeted control of T. b. rhodesiense in the domestic <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir,</b> thereby reducing the public health burden of sleeping sickness in east Africa...|$|E
40|$|Sleeping sickness, {{also known}} as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), {{is one of the}} {{neglected}} tropical diseases of sub-Saharan Africa that has plagued human health and agricultural development. In West Africa, infection with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense gives rise to a chronic disease that mainly affects humans. Infection with T. b. gambiense accounts for more than 90 % of reported sleeping sickness cases. In East Africa, infection with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense generates acute disease in humans, and also circulates in a relatively unaffected <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Both Gambian and Rhodesian sleeping sickness are fatal if left untreated. The parasites are transmitted to the mammalian host through the bite of an infected tsetse fly. Since its discovery a century ago, several waves of HAT epidemics have plagued the continent. During the colonial regimes, it was possible to bring about a steady {{decline in the number of}} reported gambiense cases from the 1930 s onwards with systematic screening, treatment, and patient follow-up in western and central Africa. However, during the post-independence period of the 1960 s when HAT cases declined, control programs within the endemic countries gradually were run down, resulting in a steep rise in incidence during the following 40 years. It has been difficult to estimate the true burden of HAT, as the disease affects the most neglected populations living in remote and rural settings where the majority of people affected are beyond the reach of health care systems and are not reported in any of the health metrics [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on HAT control and surveillance estimated in 1995 that the true number of cases was at least 10 times more than that reported considering the huge uncertainties between the reported cases and the factual field situation. Thus, from the 30, 000 reported cases annually, it was estimated that some 300, 000 infected individuals remained infected in the field [2]. In this issue of PLoS Neglected Tropica...|$|E
40|$|Shiga toxin {{producing}} Escherichia coli (STEC) harbouring the stx 2 d-activatable {{gene and}} expressing the mucus- and elastase-activatable phenotype {{have been associated}} with severe outcomes of human disease. However, there is limited data available on the occurrence of such strains in <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> In this study, we analyzed 11 STEC strains isolated from healthy cattle and sheep at slaughter that were originally detected to contain the stx 2 c allele, for the presence of the stx 2 d-activatable genotype. Ten of the 11 strains displayed the stx 2 d-activatable genotype as determine by PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 890 -bp fragments of their stx genes. However, only in six of 10 strains whose stx genes were sequenced, the presence of stx 2 d-activatable could be confirmed based on the predicted amino acid sequence of their StxA subunits; the remaining four strains contained Stx 2 c A subunit. Five of the six strains which contained stx 2 d-activatable displayed the activatable phenotype on Vero cells. Genes for adhesins such as the outer membrane protein intimin (eae), which is essential for the intimate attachment and the formation of attaching-and-effacing lesions on intestinal epithelial cells, or the STEC autoagglutinating adhesin (saa), potentially important in eae-negative STEC, were not detected. Moreover, all the strains tested negative for EHEC-hlyA encoding enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) hemolysin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the presence of STEC harbouring stx 2 d-activatable and producing the activatable Stx 2 d in fecal samples of sheep. Therefore both cattle and sheep are reservoirs of such strains and potential sources of human infections. This is of particular importance, because in contrast to other eae-negative STEC, strains producing Stx 2 dactivatable may cause severe diseases such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of S. aureus in swine held {{little interest}} until the ST 398 lineage of MRSA {{was found to}} be prevalent in pigs and pig farmers in the Netherlands in 2004 (Voss et al. 2005). ST 398 MRSA have since been detected in multiple livestock species and in many countries (EFSA, 2009; Smith and Pearson, 2011), while genetically distinct variants of ST 398 S. aureus occur in some human populations independent of <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (Carrel et al., 2017). Furthermore, other genotypes of MRSA can occur in pigs, particularly ST 9 MRSA in Asia, and ST 5 MRSA in North America (Chuang and Huang, 2015; Frana et al. 2013). In the USA, methicillin susceptible variants of the ST 398, ST 9 and ST 5 lineages are widespread in commercial swine, yet MRSA variants appear to occur at relatively low prevalence (Sun, et al., 2015). Despite common exposure to, and colonization of, swine workers by livestock associated S. aureus, significant clinical infections appear to be uncommon in occupationally exposed people. However, invasive and even fatal infections are reported at relatively low incidence in some countries, and medically compromised people appear to be at particular risk, {{even in the absence of}} animal contact (Larsen et al., 2017). There is evidence that ST 398 MRSA of livestock origin are less transmissible among humans than MRSA of human origin. Also, genomic studies typically have indicated that livestock associated MRSA (both ST 398 and ST 5) lack most virulence factors that occur in human clinical isolates (Schijffelen et al. 2010; Price et al. 2012; Hau et al, 2015). However, to date there has been little genomic characterization of methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) that are prevalent in swine populations.

30|$|Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are {{responsible}} for about 90  % of campylobacteriosis in humans (Dasti et al. 2010; Bolton 2015). C. jejuni is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chicken and wild birds, while C. coli is usually more prevalent in other animals (Dasti et al. 2010; Epps et al. 2013). Most cases are due to the consumption or handling of poultry, raw milk and untreated water (Wilson et al. 2008; Dasti et al. 2010; Epps et al. 2013). While outbreaks of Campylobacter occur occasionally, most cases are sporadic. A multi-locus sequence typing study reveals that 97  % of sporadic cases are due to strains with an animal origin, such as chicken, cattle and sheep, while only 3  % are caused by environmental strains (Wilson et al. 2008). Nevertheless, the mode of transmission of animal strains is not necessary always the consumption of contaminated animal product such as meat and raw milk. Indeed, there are many accounts of campylobacteriosis outbreaks caused by the consumption of drinking water (Vogt et al. 1982; Lind et al. 1996; Clark et al. 2003; Kuusi et al. 2004; O’Reilly et al. 2007). In some of these outbreaks, the drinking water was pumped from groundwater wells, lakes or rivers, which were likely contaminated with livestock manure coming from neighboring farms (Vogt et al. 1982; Clark et al. 2003) and/or with sewage (Vogt et al. 1982; Lind et al. 1996; O’Reilly et al. 2007). Indeed, the incidence of Campylobacter infection is tightly correlated with the load of Campylobacter in sewage effluent (Jones 2001). In addition, incidence of Campylobacter infection peaks {{at the end of}} the spring presumably caused by cyclical variation in livestock carriage of Campylobacter (Jones 2001). Therefore, proximity to the <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir</b> could be a risk factor for human infection. Lévesque et al. (2013) have performed a prospective study of the source of sporadic cases in urban and rural area in Quebec. It was found that inhabitants of rural area have a 1.89 fold higher risks of contracting campylobacteriosis than inhabitants of urban area (Lévesque et al. 2013). Moreover, they found that the two most important risk factors in rural area were the occupational exposure to animals, and the consumption of water from a private well (Lévesque et al. 2013). Taken together, these observations suggest that the contamination of drinking water supplies with strains of animal origin is an important mode of transmission for campylobacteriosis (Bronowski et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus argenteus is a newly named species {{previously}} {{described as a}} divergent lineage of Staphylococcus aureus that has recently {{been shown to have}} a global distribution. Despite growing evidence of the clinical importance of this species, knowledge about its population epidemiology and genomic architecture is limited. We used whole-genome sequencing to evaluate and compare S.  aureus (n = 251) and S.  argenteus (n = 68) isolates from adults with staphylococcal sepsis at several hospitals in northeastern Thailand between 2006 and 2013. The majority (82 %) of the S.  argenteus isolates were of multilocus sequence type 2250 (ST 2250). S.  aureus was more diverse, although 43 % of the isolates belonged to ST 121. Bayesian analysis suggested an S.  argenteus ST 2250 substitution rate of 4. 66 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 12 to 6. 38) mutations per genome per year, which was comparable to the S.  aureus ST 121 substitution rate of 4. 07 (95 % CI, 2. 61 to 5. 55). S.  argenteus ST 2250 emerged in Thailand an estimated 15  years ago, which contrasts with the S.  aureus ST 1, ST 88, and ST 121 clades that emerged around 100 to 150  years ago. Comparison of S.  argenteus ST 2250 genomes from Thailand and a global collection indicated a single introduction into Thailand, followed by transmission to local and more distant countries in Southeast Asia and further afield. S.  argenteus and S.  aureus shared around half of their core gene repertoire, indicating a high level of divergence and providing strong support for their classification as separate species. Several gene clusters were present in ST 2250 isolates but absent from the other S.  argenteus and S.  aureus study isolates. These included multiple exotoxins and antibiotic resistance genes that have been linked previously with livestock-associated S.  aureus, consistent with a <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir</b> for S.  argenteus These genes appeared to be associated with plasmids and mobile genetic elements and {{may have contributed to the}} biological success of ST 2250. IMPORTANCE In this study, we used whole-genome sequencing to understand the genome evolution and population structure of a systematic collection of ST 2250 S.  argenteus isolates. A newly identified ancestral species of S.  aureus, S.  argenteus has become increasingly known as a clinically important species that has been reported recently across various countries. Our results indicate that S.  argenteus has spread at a relatively rapid pace over the past 2 decades across northeastern Thailand and acquired multiple exotoxin and antibiotic resistance genes that have been linked previously with livestock-associated S.  aureus Our findings highlight the clinical importance and potential pathogenicity of S.  argenteus as a recently emerging pathogen...|$|E
40|$|The tsetse {{transmitted}} fatal {{disease of}} humans, sleeping sickness, {{is caused by}} two morphologically identical subspecies of the parasite T. brucei; T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. Current distributions of the two forms of disease are not known to overlap in any area, and Uganda {{is the only country}} with transmission of both. The distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda has expanded in recent years, with five districts newly affected since 1998. This movement has narrowed the gap between Rhodesian and Gambian sleeping sickness endemic areas, heightening concerns over a potential future overlap which would greatly complicate the diagnosis and treatment of the two diseases. An improved understanding of the social, environmental and climatic determinants of the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness is required to allow more effective targeting of control measures and to prevent further spread and possible concurrence with Gambian sleeping sickness. The work presented in this thesis investigates the drivers of the distribution and spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in districts of central and eastern Uganda which form part of the recent disease focus extension. The spatial distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness was examined in Kaberamaido and Dokolo districts where the disease was first reported in 2004, using three different methodologies. A traditional one-step logistic regression analysis of disease prevalence was compared with a two-step hierarchical logistic regression analysis. The two-step method included the analysis of disease occurrence followed by the analysis of disease prevalence in areas with a high predicted probability of occurrence. These two methods were compared in terms of their predictive accuracy. The incorporation of a stochastic spatial effect to model the residual spatial autocorrelation was carried out using a Bayesian geostatistical approach. The geostatistical analysis was compared with the non-spatial models to assess the importance of spatial autocorrelation, to establish which method had the highest predictive accuracy and to establish which factors were the most significant in terms of the disease’s distribution. Links between Rhodesian sleeping sickness and landcover in Soroti district were also assessed using a matched case-control study design. Temporal trends in these relationships were observed using an annually stratified analysis to allow an exploration of the disease’s dispersion following its introduction to a previously unaffected area. This work expands on previous research that demonstrated the source of infection in this area to be the movement of untreated livestock from endemic areas through a local livestock market. With regards to the comparison of regression frameworks, the two-step regression compared favourably with the traditional one-step regression, but the Bayesian geostatistical analysis outperformed both in terms of predictive accuracy. Each of these regression methods highlighted the importance of distance to the closest livestock market on the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness, indicating that the disease may have been introduced to this area via the movement of untreated cattle from endemic areas, despite the introduction of regulations requiring the treatment of livestock prior to sale. In addition, several other environmental and climatic variables were significantly associated with sleeping sickness occurrence and prevalence within the study area. The temporal stratification of the matched case-control analysis highlights the dispersion of sleeping sickness away from the point of introduction (livestock market) into more suitable areas; areas with higher proportions of seasonally flooding grassland, lower proportions of woodland and dense savannah and lower elevations. These findings relate to the habitat preferences of the predominant vector species in the study area; Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, which prefers riverine vegetation. The findings presented highlight the importance of the <b>livestock</b> <b>reservoir</b> as well as the climatic and environmental preferences of the tsetse fly vector for the introduction of Rhodesian sleeping sickness into previously unaffected areas, the subsequent spread of infection following an introduction and the equilibrium spatial distribution of the disease. By enhancing the knowledge base regarding the spatial determinants of the distribution of Rhodesian sleeping sickness within newly affected areas, future control efforts within Uganda may be better targeted to decrease prevalence and to prevent further spread of the disease.

40|$|Background Trypanosomosis {{is a major}} {{impediment}} to livestock farming in sub-Saharan Africa and limits the full potential of agricultural development in the 36 countries where it is endemic. In man, sleeping sickness is fatal if untreated and causes severe morbidity. This study was undertaken in western Kenya, {{an area that is}} endemic for both human and livestock trypanosomosis. While trypanosomosis in livestock is present at high levels of endemicity, sleeping sickness occurs at low levels over long periods, interspersed with epidemics, underscoring the complexity of the disease epidemiology. In this study, we sought to investigate the prevalence of trypanosomes in small ruminants and pigs, and the potential of these <b>livestock</b> as <b>reservoirs</b> of potentially human-infective trypanosomes. The study was undertaken in 5 villages, to address two key questions: i) are small ruminants and pigs important in the transmission dynamics of trypanosomosis? and ii), do they harbour potentially human infective trypanosomes? Answers to these questions are important in developing strategies for the control of both livestock and human trypanosomosis. Results Eighty-six animals, representing 21. 3...|$|R

Knowledge of the predominant Brucella species/strains circulating in a region is a prerequisite of a brucellosis control strategy. For this reason a study aiming at the evaluation of the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of a panel of 17 Brucella spp. isolates recovered from domestic ruminants (cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat) from four governorates during a period of five years (2002 - 2007) was carried out using microbiological tests and molecular biology techniques (PCR, MLVA- 15, and sequencing). Thirteen strains were identified as B. melitensis biovar 3 while all phenotypic and genetic techniques classified the remaining isolates as B. abortus (n = 2) and B. suis biovar 1 (n = 2). MLVA- 15 yielded a high discriminatory power (h = 0. 801), indicating a high genetic diversity among the B. melitensis strains circulating among domestic ruminants in Egypt.

Resistance to trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole was mainly found in isolates of swine and human origin.

In marginal areas, these animals contribute to food security and extract value from land unsuitable for other systems of farming. In England, close to 50 % of the national sheep flock is farmed on grassland designated as disadvantaged areas for agricultural production. Many of these areas are in the uplands, where some native breeds of sheep continue to be commercially farmed only in highly localised geographical regions {{to which they are}} adapted. This study focuses on three of these breeds, selected for their adaptation to near identical environments and their geographical concentration in regions close to one another. Our objective has been to use retrotyping, microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms to explore the origins of the breeds and whether, despite their similar adaptations and proximity, they are genetically distinctive. We find the three breeds each have a surprisingly different pattern of retrovirus insertions into their genomes compared with one another and with other UK breeds. Uniquely, there is a high incidence of the R 0 retrotype in the Herdwick population, characteristic of a primitive genome found previously in very few breeds worldwide and none in the UK mainland. The Herdwick and Rough Fells carry two rare retroviral insertion events, common only in Texels, suggesting sheep populations in the northern uplands have a historical association with the original pin-tail sheep of Texel Island.

A recent study using geo-referenced HAT case records suggested that the most recent spread of Rhodesian HAT may have been due to movements of infected, untreated <b>livestock</b> (the main <b>reservoir</b> of the parasite). Here, the initial analysis has been extended by explicitly accounting for spatial locations and their proximity to one another, providing improved accuracy. The results provide strengthened evidence of the significance of livestock movements for the continued spread of Rhodesian HAT within Uganda, despite the introduction of cattle treatment regulations which were implemented in an effort to curb the disease's spread. The application of predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of HAT in areas surrounding livestock markets, demonstrating the importance of livestock trading for continuing disease spread. This robust evidence can be used for the targeting of disease control efforts within Uganda to prevent further spread of Rhodesian HAT...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{brucellosis}} is {{disease of}} economic and public health significance in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is distributed worldwide but some countries {{have been able to}} eradicate brucellosis from their territories using elaborate brucellosis control and eradication programmes that have been targeted primarily at <b>livestock</b> (the main <b>reservoir</b> host for the disease). This has been achieved mainly by vaccination, test and slaughter, as well as by regular surveillance for early detection of the disease. Despite the level of knowledge on the epidemiology of bovine brucellosis, there has been limited success in controlling bovine brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the problems associated with the surveillance and control of bovine brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa include poor disease reporting, insufficient financial resources of governments (poor economic status of most countries in sub-Saharan Africa), as well as competing national health priorities, inadequate infrastructures and personnel, the commonly practised seasonal grazing or transhumant husbandry systems and communal grazing, inadequate monitoring of the disease in wildlife and poor communication and education of stakeholders. Since previous attempts at the control of bovine brucellosis have failed in Africa, it was considered important to address this aspect, using an approach that differed from the classic veterinary regulatory approach. Possible ways of dealing with this problem using complementary measures to the conventional approaches are also proposed...|$|R
40|$|Tsetse-transmitted {{human and}} animal trypanosomiasis are {{constraints}} to both {{human and animal}} health in sub-Saharan Africa, and although these diseases have been known for over a century, there is little recent evidence demonstrating how the parasites circulate in natural hosts and ecosystems. The spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness (caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense) within Uganda over the past 15 years {{has been linked to}} the movement of infected, untreated <b>livestock</b> (the predominant <b>reservoir)</b> from endemic areas. However, despite an understanding of the environmental dependencies of sleeping sickness, little research has focused on the environmental factors controlling transmission establishment or the spatially heterogeneous dispersal of disease following a new introduction. In the current study, an annually stratified case-control study of Rhodesian sleeping sickness cases from Serere District, Uganda was used to allow the temporal assessment of correlations between the spatial distribution of sleeping sickness and landscape factors. Significant relationships were detected between Rhodesian sleeping sickness and selected factors, including elevation and the proportion of land which was "seasonally flooding grassland" or "woodlands and dense savannah. " Temporal trends in these relationships were detected, illustrating the dispersal of Rhodesian sleeping sickness into more 'suitable' areas over time, with diminishing dependence on the point of introduction in concurrence with an increasing dependence on environmental and landscape factors. These results provide a novel insight into the ecology of Rhodesian sleeping sickness dispersal and may contribute towards the implementation of evidence-based control measures to prevent its further spread...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2013. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisor: Peter R. Davies. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 73 pages. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) {{is a common}} colonizer of both humans and pigs (Lowy, 1998; Frana, 2012). The ability of S. aureus to acquire genes that confer resistance to multiple drugs has further elevated its importance to public health (Cuny and Witte, 2008 a). In particular, clones of S. aureus that are resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antimicrobials (MRSA) are a major clinical problem, and the discovery of MRSA in livestock populations has raised concerns about the potential importance of <b>livestock</b> as <b>reservoirs</b> of MRSA (Voss et al., 2005). However, the importance of pigs in S. aureus transmission to humans and clinical disease {{is yet to be}} determined (Cuny and Witte, 2008 b). Most recent studies of pigs have focused on MRSA, and there have been no comprehensive studies of the epidemiology of S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA) in pigs. Despite being considered ubiquitous in production animal facilities (Frana, 2012), S. aureus ecology in livestock production farms is poorly documented. Most recent research has used selective enrichment methods to study MRSA in swine populations, rather than generic S. aureus. S. aureus can be isolated from several anatomic sites of pigs, as well as from air, environmental samples and persons having contact with pigs. In fact, isolation of S. aureus in air samples from swine barns suggests this is likely an important route of exposure for people working in livestock facilities (Gibbs et al., 2006; Oppliger et al., 2012). Overall, the limited information on the ecology of S. aureus in the pork production chain limits the ability of the swine industry to understand and communicate the risks to public health in an informed manner. The core rationale for this thesis was that there has been no prior systematic effort to describe the occurrence of S. aureus in swine production systems. The vast majority of studies have focused on MRSA strains using selective culture methods, and/or focused on a limited number of matrices. The objective was therefore to obtain preliminary data on the occurrence of S. aureus in pigs, people, environmental and air samples on pig farms and some insight into the distribution of the organism in the swine farm milieu. Thus, a pilot study of the epidemiology of S. aureus in multiple site swine production was conducted...|$|R
40|$|The {{semi-arid}} {{highlands of}} Northern Ethiopia (Tigray) have numerous small reservoirs {{that have been}} created by microdams {{in an attempt to}} provide water supply for irrigation and livestock drinking. Although the reservoirs have substantial added value to residents, their use as water resource is jeopardized by eutrophication and a high occurrence of blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. So far, there is no systematic information available on the limnological and aquatic ecological characteristics of these dams. We carried out a standardized survey of 32 reservoirs and assessed a wide set of morphometric, abiotic and biotic variables. The sampling was performed during two seasons, September-October 2004 (end of the wet season/start of the dry season) and April-May 2005 (towards the end of the dry season). Using multivariate analysis, we revealed dominating patterns of variable associations and compared the variability in these patterns among seasons. According to standardized PCA and RDA analyses, the most important axis of variation was mainly represented by a gradient in nutrients and altitude that was also positively associated with phytoplankton biomass, suspended matter and oxygen concentration, and negatively with water transparency. For most variables, correlations between the wet and dry season were weak, which suggests that individual reservoirs behaved rather differently in their response to seasonal changes. Nevertheless, a Mantel correlation (r = 0. 32; P = 0. 035) showed a weak but significant overall concordance in the variable association patterns among seasons. A number of reservoirs became very shallow or fell dry in the dry season, a process that was associated with an increase in suspended matter and conductivity and a decrease in transparency. These reservoirs contained lower amounts of fish and tended to be less eutrophic than the deeper, permanent systems, as they had lower levels of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. With multiple regression analysis, we constructed most parsimonious models in an attempt to explain the variation in key biotic variables: phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass, cladoceran biomass, fish biomass and the abundance of submerged vegetation. Phytoplankton and fish biomass tended to be positively related with the concentration of total phosphorus, whereas cladoceran biomass was not associated with nutrient concentrations. The positive association of fish and phytoplankton with nutrient concentrations suggests a bottom-up control, whereas the absence of an association between zooplankton and nutrient concentrations may be indicative for top-down control. The biomass of cyanobacteria was negatively related to the biomass of cladocerans (Daphnia), which likely reflects a top-down effect. Most reservoirs were turbid. The occurrence and abundance of macrophytes tended to be positively related to water transparency and was negatively associated to TP and the amount of <b>livestock</b> frequenting the <b>reservoirs.</b> However, macrophytes were not limited to clear-water reservoirs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Extensive {{studies on}} tickborne {{pathogens}} (TBPs) {{have been conducted}} in developed nations, relatively less {{has been done in}} developing nations leaving a large gap of knowledge. Mongolia, a country built upon nomadic culture and pastoralism is an ideal system to study TBPs as the population is at an increased risk due to increased time spent outside herding livestock. Discoveries of TBPs in Mongolia include Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp. and tick-borne encephalitis virus. While research has focused on TBPs in humans and ticks in Mongolia, little research has assessed animal reservoirs, specifically small mammal species, as reservoirs for TBPs. This project aimed to 1) identify the role of small mammal species in the ecology of TBPs in Mongolia, specifically Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia spp. using serological and molecular analysis and 2) identify risk factors associated with the prevalence of TBPs in small mammal populations in Mongolia. Methods: From June to July 2016, rodents were live-trapped, and whole blood, serum and ear biopsy samples were collected. Sixty-four rodents were trapped in three aimags (provinces) in northern Mongolia. Whole blood samples were tested by PCR to detect the presence of Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia spp [...] In addition, ear biopsy samples were tested by PCR to detect the presence of Borrelia spp [...] All rodents were serologically tested for antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia rickettsii. A multivariate model was used to assess risk factors for the presence of tickborne pathogens. Risk factors examined included species and sex of animal, location and presence of ticks. Results: 56. 0 %, 39. 0 % and 0. 0 % of animals were positive by PCR for Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma spp., respectively. 41. 9 % and 24. 2 % of animals were seropositive for A. phagocytophilum and Rickettsia rickettsii, respectively. Risk factors found to be important predictors of Borrelia spp. molecular detection included small mammal capture in Tov aimag (OR, 4. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 00 – 16. 80), male small mammals (OR, 3. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 99 – 9. 51) and ground squirrel species type (OR, 3. 24; 95 % CI, 0. 90 – 11. 70). The risk factor found to be an important predictor of Rickettsia spp. molecular detection was Mongolian gerbil species type (OR, 246. 5; 95 % CI, 20. 77 – 2925. 88). Presence of ticks on small mammals (OR, 4. 62; 95 % CI, 0. 92 – 23. 24) was an important risk factor for A. phagocytophilum antibody detection. No risk factors were identified as being important predictors of antibody detection of R. Rickettsii. Conclusion: The results of this study provide considerable evidence of TBPs circulating in small mammal populations in Northern Mongolia. Further information on TBPs in ticks, humans, <b>livestock</b> and wildlife <b>reservoirs</b> will be important to address public health interventions for TBPs in Mongolia in the future. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{persistent}} {{spread of}} Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda {{in recent years}} has increased concerns of a potential overlap with the Gambian form of the disease. Recent research has aimed to increase the evidence base for targeting control measures by focusing on the environmental and climatic factors that control the spatial distribution of the disease. Objectives One recent study used simple logistic regression methods to explore the relationship between prevalence of Rhodesian HAT and several social, environmental and climatic variables in two of the most recently affected districts of Uganda, and suggested the disease had spread into the study area due to the movement of infected, untreated livestock. Here we extend this study to account for spatial autocorrelation, incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters and undertake predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in future. Materials and Methods Using a spatial analysis in which a generalised linear geostatistical model is used in a Bayesian framework to account explicitly for spatial autocorrelation and incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters we are able to demonstrate a more rigorous analytical approach, potentially resulting in more accurate parameter and significance estimates and increased predictive accuracy, thereby allowing an assessment of the validity of the livestock movement hypothesis given more robust parameter estimation and appropriate assessment of covariate effects. Results Analysis strongly supports the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. The confounding effect of health care accessibility on the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature have also been confirmed via the application of these methods. Conclusions Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in the future in areas surrounding livestock markets, demonstrating the importance of livestock trading for continuing disease spread. Adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale is essential {{to prevent the spread of}} sleeping sickness in Uganda.
