The {{majority}} {{of the items in}} the list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E

50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{works by}} scanning a sequence <b>of</b> terminal <b>symbols</b> {{and building a}} <b>list</b> <b>of</b> all the <b>symbol</b> pairs which it has read. Whenever a second occurrence of a pair is discovered, the two occurrences are replaced in the sequence by an invented nonterminal <b>symbol,</b> the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbol</b> pairs is adjusted to match the new sequence, and scanning continues. If a pair's nonterminal symbol is used only in the just created symbol's definition, the used symbol is replaced by its definition and the symbol {{is removed from the}} defined nonterminal symbols. Once the scanning has been completed, the transformed sequence can be interpreted as the top-level rule in a grammar for the original sequence. The rule definitions for the nonterminal symbols which it contains {{can be found in the}} <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbol</b> pairs. Those rule definitions may themselves contain additional nonterminal symbols whose rule definitions can also be read from elsewhere in the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbol</b> pairs.|$|R

However, it relies heavily on mutating list structure and similar imperative features.|$|R
50|$|Some {{languages}} have {{an elegant}} self-interpreter, such as Lisp or Prolog. Much research on self-interpreters (particularly reflective interpreters) {{has been conducted}} in the Scheme programming language, a dialect of Lisp. In general, however, any Turing-complete language allows writing of its own interpreter. Lisp is such a language, because Lisp programs are <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbols</b> and other <b>lists.</b> XSLT is such a language, because XSLT programs are written in XML. A sub-domain of meta-programming is the writing of domain-specific languages (DSLs).|$|R

5000|$|In one {{particular}} study, rats and pigeons {{were required to}} press a button {{a certain number of}} times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased. Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1-9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [...] "a-ha!" [...] moment and understand that the value of any integer n is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>symbols</b> (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings. These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the [...] "open-ended generative property" [...] of language in human numeral cognition.|$|E
