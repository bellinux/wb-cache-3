25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high MOSFET output impedance, {{which is to}} say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, {{the influence of the}} drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance, circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent figure.|$|E

25|$|The Ecuadorian economy, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mother country, {{suffered}} a severe depression {{throughout most of}} the 18th century. Textile production dropped an estimated 50 to 75 percent between 1700 and 1800. Ecuador's cities gradually fell into ruins, and by 1790 the elite was reduced to poverty, selling haciendas and jewelry in order to subsist. The Native Ecuadorian population, in contrast, probably experienced an overall improvement in its situation, as the closing of the obrajes commonly led Native Ecuadorians to work under less arduous conditions on either haciendas or traditional communal lands. Ecuador's economic woes were, no doubt, compounded by the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 by King Charles III of Spain. Missions in the Oriente were abandoned, and many of the best schools and the most efficient haciendas and obrajes lost the key that made them outstanding institutions in colonial Ecuador.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Rudyard Kipling referred to lines 69 and 70, alongside three lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan, when he claimed of poetry: [...] "In all the millions permitted there are no more than five—five little lines—of which one can say, 'These are the magic. These are the vision. The rest is only Poetry.'" [...] In 1906, Alexander Mackie argued: [...] "The nightingale and the lark for long monopolised poetic idolatry--a privilege they enjoyed solely on account of their pre-eminence as song birds. Keats's Ode to a Nightingale and Shelley's Ode to a Skylark are two of the glories of English literature; but both were written by men who had no claim to special or exact knowledge of ornithology as such." [...] Sidney Colvin, in 1920, argued, [...] "Throughout this ode Keats’s genius is at its height. Imagination cannot be more rich and satisfying, felicity of phrase and cadence cannot be more absolute, than in the several contrasted stanzas calling for the draft of southern vintage [...] To praise the art of a passage <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth stanza [...] to praise or comment on a stroke of art like this is to throw doubt on the reader’s power to perceive it for himself." ...|$|E

She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who do things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E

Amanda Dobbins of New York gave props to Madonna for looking good in a leotard and for giving break to the young actors accompanying her in the video. Brett Warner of the website Ology appreciated the vintage feel of the video writing: [...] "Heavy sigh. Remember a time when pop videos didn't have to shimmer and sparkle, when you didn't need choreographed dance routines or outlandish costumes? Remember when cars and cleavage was enough? Madonna clearly does." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator agreed, writing that the video is [...] "the most fun visual [...] offered up in years... All in all, a fantastic video {{for one of the}} more mediocre tracks off MDNA." [...] Mark Hogan from Spin noted that the video appeared a literal take on the song's lyrics but the change of scenery to the Italian countryside and the party scenes made it endearing. Melinda Newman from HitFix said that although the video did not live up to Madonna's other endeavors, it fit the [...] "carefree" [...] theme of the song. She found influences of Italian film director Federico Fellini's works, especially his 1957 release Nights of Cabiria, in the scene showing Madonna picking up prostitutes in her car.|$|E

2500|$|The intense but varied Metal Circus EP/mini-album was {{released}} in 1983. Hüsker Dü's more melodic take on hardcore struck a chord with college students, and various tracks from Metal Circus, particularly Hart's [...] "Diane," [...] were put into rotation by dozens of campus radio stations across the U.S. In addition, on Metal Circus the band showed more invention, skill, and melody than it did {{over the course of}} their previous full album, Everything Falls Apart. Songs such as [...] "Real World," [...] with lyrics like, [...] "You want to change the world, by breaking rules and laws; people don't do things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world at all," [...] helped to illustrate that the band was capable of writing songs with a deeper, more personal meaning.

2500|$|While {{infidelity}} is by {{no means}} exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors. Furthermore, within a [...] "homogeneous culture," [...] <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived. Larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues. These patterns are observed in other cultures as well. For example, a cantina in a small, rural Mexican community is often viewed as a place where [...] "decent" [...] or [...] "married" [...] women do not go because of its semi-private nature. Conversely, public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction. A smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity. However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view. It would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city. These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well (Hirsch et al. 2007). Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.|$|E

The actor has said that the appeal of the character is [...] "the cheekiness of the guy[...] [...] everybody at that age would like to be as quick-witted as Fletch, and as uncaring about what others think." [...] Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because [...] "it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it. Even though there was a script, the director allowed me to just go, and in many ways, I was directing the comedy." [...] Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: [...] "I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did a good job with it." [...] The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: [...] "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list." [...] The 2005 animated feature Hoodwinked depicted the Big Bad Wolf (from Little Red Riding Hood) as a sarcastic investigative reporter in a direct parody of Fletch, right up to the Lakers shirt, disguises, and a version of Fletch's theme playing during his scenes.|$|E
