Until recently, Apple's professional applications (e.g. Final Cut Studio, Logic Studio) included a QuickTime Pro license. Pro keys are specific to the major version of QuickTime {{for which they are}} purchased and unlock additional features of the QuickTime Player application on macOS or Windows. The Pro key does not require any additional downloads; entering the registration code immediately unlocks the hidden features.|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to the problem of the secure management and distribution of <b>licenses</b> and <b>keys</b> associated to protected resources. We have identified different use cases to illustrate the requirements of a DRM system including download, superdistribution, streaming and groups or domains of users and/or devices of a user. The different mechanisms that we propose are based in MPEG- 21 standard. These mechanisms enable the secure distribution of the protected content, <b>licenses</b> and <b>keys,</b> for the different scenarios analysed. Moreover, the solutions provided support joint and separate distribution of content, <b>licenses</b> and <b>keys.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R

In 2001, a UK security company called Bit Arts successfully managed to bypass product activation on Windows XP, while in 2003, volume <b>license</b> <b>keys</b> for Windows XP were leaked to the public, allowing users who had not purchased a volume license to the operating system to bypass activation. In 2009, several security flaws in Windows 7 were used by hackers to circumvent activation.|$|R

50|$|Many {{programs}} {{attempt to}} verify or validate <b>licensing</b> <b>keys</b> over the Internet {{by establishing a}} session with a licensing application of the software publisher. Advanced keygens bypass this mechanism, and include additional features for key verification, for example by generating the validation data which would otherwise be returned by an activation server. If the software offers phone activation then the keygen could generate the correct activation code to finish activation. Another method {{that has been used}} is activation server emulation, this patches the program memory to use the keygen as activation server.|$|R
