If connected {{directly across}} an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which {{has developed a}} <b>lowered</b> <b>trigger</b> voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire.

50|$|Some {{electronic}} components develop lower resistances or <b>lower</b> <b>triggering</b> voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or PTC current limiters.|$|R
50|$|On the double-trigger Tranter revolvers, {{a second}} trigger below the trigger guard served to cock the gun. The hammer on this model had no spur and {{therefore}} {{could not be}} cocked with the thumb. To fire the weapon in the single-action mode, one had to first press the <b>lower</b> <b>trigger,</b> which would pull the hammer back and rotate the cylinder; at this point one could fire the gun with a light pull on the upper trigger. To fire more rapidly, one could pull both triggers simultaneously, making it a double-action weapon.|$|R

The hammer is automatically cocked, and pulling the trigger simply releases the it.

40|$|AbstractThe CMS {{collaboration}} considers {{upgrading the}} muon forward region which is particularly {{affected by the}} high-luminosity conditions at the LHC. The proposal involves Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers, which are {{able to handle the}} extreme particle rates expected in this region along with a high spatial resolution. This allows to combine tracking and triggering capabilities, which will improve the CMS muon High Level Trigger, the muon identification and the track reconstruction. Intense R&D has lead to the development of several GEM prototypes and associated detector electronics which were operated in several test beams. Strip cluster parameters, detection efficiency, and spatial resolution for charged particles are studied with position and high voltage scans and at different inclination angles. A first GEM station is foreseen to be already installed in LHC Phase-I to operate jointly together with the existing CSC detectors in the forward region. The resulting improved transverse momentum assignment and <b>lower</b> <b>trigger</b> fake rate will reduce the needed bandwidth and therefore allow to <b>lower</b> the <b>trigger</b> threshold resulting in an increased sensitivity in channels triggering on soft muons, such as H to tau's with subsequent leptonic decays to muons.

40|$|Abstract- The {{coherent}} signal averaging process requires an accurate {{estimation of the}} fiducial point in all beats to be averaged. The temporal cross-correlation between the detected beat and a template beat is the typical alignment method used with high-resolution ECG (HRECG) records. However, this technique does not produce a precise fiducial mark in records with high noise levels. In this study, we propose a new alignment method based on the multi-scale cross-correlation between the wavelet transforms of the template and the detected beat, respectively. The wavelet and temporal methods were tested for several simulated records corrupted with white noise and electromyographic (EMG) noise of different RMS levels. The results indicate that wavelet alignment method produces a <b>lower</b> <b>trigger</b> jitter than the temporal method in all tests. We conclude that the proposed alignment method {{can be used in}} records with high noise levels, like those found in Holter HRECG systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{appraisal of}} the data used {{for the establishment of}} the trigger values for the exposure of the aquatic environment to human medicines and the terrestrial environment to veterinary medicines leads to the recommendation to change these values. The (draft) technical guidance documents in support of the European registration procedure for human and veterinary medicines demand no risk assessment for substances with an exposure level below a certain trigger value for water (10 ng/L) and soil (100 ug/kg), respectively. However, the EU Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment did not consider the proposed number of the aquatic trigger to be scientifically valid. The EU Scientific Steering Committee also considered the soil trigger value as non-scientific.

40|$|Modern {{anaesthetic}} {{techniques have}} resulted in the clinical presentation of malignant hyperthermia to be more often indolent and/or insidious than truly fulminant, as previously known in the anaesthetic community. We present four recently referred cases to illustrate this point: one late-onset case, two patients with slowly progressive hypercapnia as the sole sign and a fourth patient with postoperative myalgias and elevated creatine kinase. We also discuss the reasons for the shift in typical clinical presentation. The more insidious character of malignant hyperthermia is most likely due to the <b>lower</b> <b>triggering</b> potency of modern volatile anaesthetics, the mitigating effects of several intravenous drugs (neuromuscular blocking agents, alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonists, beta adrenergic blockade) or techniques (neuraxial anaesthesia) and the routine use of end-tidal CO 2 monitoring leading to the early withdrawal of triggering drugs. Awareness among anaesthetists of this change in presentation is important since the clinical diagnosis is often more doubtful and, if corroborative evidence is not sought, the diagnosis may be delayed or missed altogether...|$|R

Surveys were undertaken in four regions in Morocco, representing different mean and variability of rainfall conditions. Results indicate that respondents in the high variability regions preferred contracts that paid out more often (had higher rainfall trigger levels), and which were more costly. In fact, a strong majority of respondents indicated they would purchase these contracts at the fair-value price; the estimated median willingness to pay for such contracts was between 12 - 20 percent above the fair value contract. However, in the lower rainfall variability regions, the cheaper contracts with <b>lower</b> <b>trigger</b> values were the only contracts for which the estimated median willingness to pay was greater than the fair-value of the contract. Finally, estimated coefficients for explanatory variables such as human and physical assets, debt levels, etc. did not have consistent impacts, either across or within regions. ...|$|R
40|$|Through smart {{scheduling}} and triggering of automation support, adaptive automation {{has the potential}} to balance air traffic controller workload. The challenge in the design of adaptive automation systems is to decide how and when the automation should provide support. This paper describes the design of a novel mechanism for adaptively invoking automation support. Whereas most adaptive automation support systems are reactive in that they invoke automation support after controller workload has increased, the aim of the designed mechanism is to proactively trigger automation support prior to workload increases. To do this, the mechanism assesses the quality of air traffic controller's decisions. The designed adaptive automation system has been tested in a human-in-the-loop experiment. Results indicate that the adaptive support helps to increase efficiency and safety as compared to manual control. However, <b>lower</b> <b>triggering</b> thresholds (resulting in more frequent automation intervention) increased the frustration level of participants (as measured with NASA TLX) and decreased acceptance of the support.

40|$|The mass {{marketing}} of inexpensive capacitance probes {{has opened the}} door for development of smart irrigation controllers based on soil moisture content. The advantage over climate based irrigation is that these systems are easier to use and can compensate for rainfall and variations in the irrigation system application rate. In this work, a smart irrigation controller was developed using EC- 5 Echo sensors connected to Siemens LOGO microcontrollers to start the irrigation process. The system was validated in a lettuce crop grown in a greenhouse in southern Portugal. The sensors were buried 10 cm in the center of mini-lysimeters with four different trigger points: 25, 22, 20 and 17 % volumetric soil moisture, and the irrigation depth set to replenish the soil to field capacity. The results indicate that the main challenge to soil irrigation control is the precise location of the sensor in relation to the drippers.
