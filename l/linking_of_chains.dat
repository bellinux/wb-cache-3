50|$|Typically {{the length}} <b>of</b> the forged <b>chain</b> could vary from around 12 inches (30 cm) up to 48 inches (120 cm). The chain links could have many {{different}} shapes including round, elliptical, and egg-shaped. The thickness <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> also varied. Usually the first <b>link</b> <b>of</b> <b>chain</b> {{attached to the}} weight was round and often larger and thicker than the rest <b>of</b> the <b>links</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{kinematic chain}} is a chain {{in which every}} <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> makes contact at a joint with every other <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain.</b> Simple closed-loop chains, semicomplete, and complete <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> mobility unity are investigated topologically to determine the limits within which {{it is possible for}} all these three kinds <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> to exist. A study is made mainly in terms of: (a) the number <b>of</b> <b>links,</b> l; (b) the number of joints, j; and (c) the degree <b>of</b> that <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> whose degree is greatest, Δ. Some brief remarks are made on the application of these ideas to the field of practical machine design. ...|$|R

2500|$|Chainrings (also called [...] "chain rings", [...] "chainwheels" [...] or [...] "sprockets", {{although}} sprocket is {{used this}} way {{mostly in the}} BMX community) engage the chain to transfer power to the (usually rear) wheel. They usually have teeth spaced to engage every <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> as it passes over; however, in the past, some designs (called skip-tooth or inch-pitch) have had one tooth for every other <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain.</b>|$|R

There are no moving parts to the link, although some have additional swivel pieces.|$|R

40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} on a two-component {{multiple}} schedule {{in which each}} separate component consisted <b>of</b> a three-link <b>chain</b> schedule. After initial baseline training, the stimuli correlated with the terminal <b>links</b> <b>of</b> each <b>chain</b> were presented in a successive discrimination, with one stimulus continuing {{to be associated with}} reinforcement while responses to the alternative stimulus were extinguished. Subjects were then returned to the original chain schedule, but with extinction in effect in both components of the multiple schedule. In two separate experiments, extinction of initial-link responding was not affected by which terminal link had been extinguished during the separate discrimination training, indicating that devaluation <b>of</b> the terminal <b>link</b> was not transmitted directly to the initial <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain.</b> There was also no effect of the devaluation procedure during the first session of testing on responding in the middle <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain,</b> but an effect did develop with continued extinction <b>of</b> the entire <b>chain</b> when the terminal components were presented during extinction. When the terminal components were omitted, however, the latter effect did not occur. Also, when the terminal link was omitted, extinction occurred more rapidly in the middle component than in the initial component, indicating a backward pattern of extinction.

Another important <b>link</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> involves guests, their satisfaction, and loyalty.

The practical section of this thesis demonstrates the questionnaires, process of interviewing and evaluation of data.
