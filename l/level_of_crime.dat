5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> {{the death penalty is}} brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} around 4,000 islanders were sentenced for {{breaking}} laws during the occupation (around 2,600 in Jersey and 1,400 in Guernsey); 570 prisoners {{were sent to}} continental prisons and camps, and at least 22 persons from Jersey and 9 from Guernsey did not return. It may seem a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> but equates to 12 people per 1,000, per annum, similar to the 2010-2014 conviction rates in England and Wales. If you exclude crimes against Germans and conviction of offences that had not existed in 1939, such as breaking curfew, it indicates a level of general good behaviour. The severe penalties imposed by Courts no doubt had {{had an effect on}} the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> fines could be as high as several years pay or even the value of a house.

25|$|Colajanni was {{the first}} to publish a book with {{criminal}} sociology in the title.

40|$|As crime becomes {{increasingly}} widespread {{it may be}} optimal not to lower but to increase the standard of evidence. Even though {{a higher standard of}} evidence results in a lower expected penalty for all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> it increases the expected penalty for high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> relative to the expected penalty for lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Consequently, a high standard of evidence is more effective in deterring high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> As the proportion of agents with a low opportunity cost <b>of</b> committing <b>crime</b> increases, the standard of evidence should be increased...|$|R

25|$|Being Sicily's {{administrative}} capital, Palermo is a centre {{for much}} of the region's finance, tourism and commerce. The city currently hosts an international airport, and Palermo's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses. The economy mainly relies on tourism and services, but also has commerce, shipbuilding and agriculture. The city, however, still has high unemployment levels, high corruption and a significant black market empire (Palermo being the home of the Sicilian Mafia). Even though the city still suffers from widespread corruption, inefficient bureaucracy and organized crime, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> in Palermo has gone down dramatically, unemployment has been decreasing and many new, profitable opportunities for growth (especially regarding tourism) have been introduced, making the city safer and better to live in.|$|E

25|$|But by 1820 {{faith in}} the {{efficacy}} of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving {{as a model for}} the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote Democracy in America as a result of his visit.|$|E

500|$|Newspaper {{accounts}} {{exaggerated the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and violence {{that accompanied the}} strike, resulting in a national furor that shaped the political response. A Philadelphia paper viewed the Boston violence in the same light as other labor unrest and numerous race riots in 1919: [...] "Bolshevism in the United States {{is no longer a}} specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance." [...] President Woodrow Wilson, speaking from Montana, branded the walkout [...] "a crime against civilization" [...] that left the city [...] "at the mercy of an army of thugs." [...] He said that [...] "the obligation of a policeman is as sacred and direct as the obligation of a soldier. He is a public servant, not a private employee, and the whole honor of the community is in his hands. He has no right to prefer any private advantage to the public safety." [...] Elihu Root, a former Secretary of War and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, told a Carnegie Hall audience on September 17 that the strike was an attack on constitutional government because it represented [...] "the passing of power to enforce laws, the power to punish crime, the power to maintain order from the whole people of the United States" [...] to the 3% of the population represented by the AFL.|$|E
2500|$|The role of {{the media}} is pivotal in shaping {{perceptions}} about the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> in society and promoting populist causes. In Anglo-Saxon countries in particular, the tabloid media {{tend to focus on}} stories about violent crime, especially when there are lurid or unusual circumstances. [...] In Britain, the extensive coverage given to the ten-year-old killers of James Bulger is a typical example. In New Zealand, 12-year-old Bailey Junior Kurariki received similar media attention for years after his involvement in the death of Michael Choy, who was bashed to death as he delivered a pizza.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{improvements}} {{were made}} to Federal Triangle, however. [...] A new cooling plant was built in 1960.

In 1972, the Federal Triangle Washington Metro station was approved at Federal Triangle, and the station on Metro's Blue and Orange lines opened on July 1, 1977. Major heating, cooling, and electrical upgrades {{were made to}} the Archives, ICC, and Labor buildings and the Departmental Auditorium in 1984. After the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 (which killed 168 people), security at Federal Triangle was tightened measurably and many of the pedestrian areas and buildings restricted to federal employees or those with official business. A major renovation for the Labor, ICC, and Post Office buildings was conducted in 1998.|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the impact}} of the New Deal for Communities (NDC) {{initiatives}} on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> is important both for the evaluation of the NDC programme, and, more generally, to advance our understanding of what works in crime prevention (for reviews see, Hirschfield, Johnson and Bowers; Sherman et al.; Visher and Weisburd). However, measuring the impacts <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> prevention (or other) schemes is not necessarily a simple process and is one that is often misunderstood. A number of the NDCs have made claims regarding the impact <b>of</b> initiatives on <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> In this report we examine the claims made by three NDCs, these being Bradford, East Brighton and East Manchester.

Three urban case study areas in the UK are used. The findings suggest that the risk <b>of</b> bus <b>crime</b> along a journey is influenced by overall <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (for specific categories <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> only), that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> risk increases in high crime areas, and that risk is raised further when there are more stops along that route. Prevention implications of these findings are discussed, and avenues for future research are presented...|$|R

40|$|Reported <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> {{continue}} to fall, but fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> remains a significant social problem. Previous studies have identified several factors that predict fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (e. g. age and gender) however; {{it is not}} obvious how this information {{can be used to}} help distinguish between individuals in larger groups. Personality is predictive of other lifestyle outcomes yet its relationship with fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> remains unknown.
