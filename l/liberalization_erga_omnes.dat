In legal terminology, <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> rights or {{obligations}} are owed toward all. For instance a property right is an <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> entitlement, and therefore enforceable against anybody infringing that right. An <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> right (a statutory right) can here {{be distinguished from}} a right based on contract, unenforceable except against the contracting party.|$|R
40|$|So-called {{obligations}} <b>erga</b> <b>omnes,</b> owed to {{the international}} community as a whole, including all States, now form part of positive international law. These obligations protect some of the most basic values of present-day international relations. Examples include the obligations not to commit genocide or torture, to uphold the most basic human rights, to respect the self-determination of peoples, and so on. However, there is little agreement as to what these obligations imply, how they have come about, and how to identify them. In the literature, at least, there is widespread agreement that obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are different in essence and in nature from obligations owed by one State to another State, so-called obligations inter partes. In turn, this —alleged— radical conceptual break severs obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> from a wealth of norms that exist in present-day, general international law, but whose origins lie farther back in time. This thesis attempts to reconcile obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> with obligations arising in classic, general international law. It explores {{what it means to be}} owed an obligation and how it came to pass that most obligations were owed inter partes. The particular way in which sovereignty came to be conceived and the furtherance of sovereignty, at the expense of other values, forms the pattern that gave rise to obligations inter partes. But even at that time, exceptions to this pattern existed which brought about obligations analogous to those owed <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> today. Relevant state practice will be analysed. If obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> could have been created in classic international law, it is unjustified to maintain that obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> represent so radical a break with the past. Obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are aggregates of bilateral, primary obligations. From this perspective, it is possible to identify these obligations, their consequences, and to discern their origins. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> {{norms are}} those that give {{third-party}} states, rather than just the victim, legal claims against states that violate them. This paper argues that ordinary two-party norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation injures only one state and that other states that seek to retaliate on that state’s behalf are likely using the violation as a pretext for predatory behavior. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation injures multiple states and that states {{have an incentive to}} free ride rather than retaliate against the violator. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> norms reduce the incentive to free ride {{but at the same time}} reintroduce the risk that some states will use a norm violation as a pretext for engaging in predatory behavior...|$|R
40|$|From the {{analytical}} viewpoint a norm can formally {{be regarded as}} a right-duty (or claim-obligation) relation (1) that regulates behaviour (action/inaction) (2) among subjects (3) in definite space (4) and time (5). Consequently, a legal order can be defined as a system of right-duty (or claim-obligation) relations that regulate behaviour (action/inaction) among subjects in definite space and are procedurally organised in the vertical and horizontal sense according to time. An iconic representation of these minimum necessary concepts allows switching from natural language to a purely formal representation of the legal system(s) (deontic network). Within this ‘geometrical’ frame, general principles (the ‘basis’) of (international) law can be conceived of as general obligations, i. e. obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> (towards everyone). Obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> (ties), indivisible or divisible because of their content, link a subject (node) to every other subject of international law, endowed with a correlative claim (s – s), so that the whole obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are matched by the whole claims <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> of all the subjects of international law. Indivisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are unavailable from the viewpoint of the power, so cogentes, breaches violate necessarily all the correlative claims, possibly enabling every subject to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as indivisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes,</b> the violation of which allows universal enforcement. Nevertheless, specifically by reason of the gravity of the breach, it is possible to split primary and secondary norms, conceiving of the sanction as a bilateral relation allowing solely reciprocal enforcement {{in the case of an}} infringement. Divisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are available from the viewpoint of the power, so dispositivae, breaches must be seen as relative, enabling only the subject(s) injured to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as bilateral obligations, the infringement of which gives rise to reciprocal enforcement. Nevertheless, it is possible to figure out that specifically the gravity of the breach ‘unifies’ the primary divisible obligation, allowing universal invocation of the responsibility, so that the secondary obligation could be either bilateral or a general indivisible one, respectively permitting relative or absolute enforcement in the case of a breach...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the International Court of Justice {{declared}} that {{states have a}} duty to prevent genocide from occurring in another state since the prevention and punishment of genocide is a concern of every state and of the international community as a whole. The doctrine of the responsibility to protect will be analysed {{in the light of the}} <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> and <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> partes character of the rules embodied in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is argued that, even though there are differences between the Court’s decisions about genocide and the applicable regime regarding the consequences of serious violations of <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations, they are both consonant with the doctrine of the responsibility to protect since they are both inspired by the need to guarantee the protection of fundamental legal value...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{judicial}} enforcement by the International Court of Justice of <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations. While the concept of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> was enunciated {{for the first time}} in paras. 33 and 34 of the Barcelona Traction judgment, the main consequences of this kind of international obligations on the proceedings before the ICJ are still very controversial. By deeply analyzing ICJ’s jurisprudence since 1970, the paper tries to find answers to some very important questions: do all States, irrespective of individual injury, have standing to institute ICJ proceedings in the general interest in response to <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> breaches? Is it possible to configure a sort of actio popularis in the international legal order? Is the consent of states to ICJ jurisdiction always necessary? The authors admit <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> claims brought in defence of general interests of the international community. While not unequivocal, the Barcelona Traction dictum, as well as the successive jurisprudence of the Court, strongly supports this view. In any case, proceedings could only be brought against States that have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction. The paper also examines the question of the relationship between ‘injured State’ and ‘States other than an injured State’ as to the content of the claims which may be brought before the Court...|$|R

40|$|The {{decisions}} of the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) taken in the so called abstract control of constitutionality provoke a huge impact all over the country, for its effects reach everyone. Nonetheless, those effects are not applicable {{to everyone in the}} same way. Thus, some are compelled by the binding effect (âefeito vinculanteâ) &# 8213; like all the administrative organs and all the judges, barring the Supreme Court itself &# 8213;, while others &# 8213; such as the legislators, when exerting their legislative powers &# 8213; simply are not. On the other hand, everyone is bound by the res iudicata <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> effect, including the Supreme Court and the legislators. Furthermore, the self concept of binding effect (âefeito vinculanteâ) is not yet clear in the doctrine and in the jurisprudence. As a matter of fact, considering that even the Supreme Court has not outlined its range, the definition of binding effect remains quite mysterious. Nevertheless, a plain definition is proposed, based upon the constitutional text. Moreover, the objective and subjective limits of the binding effect are analyzed, as well as the differences with regard to the res iudicata <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> and to the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> efficacy (âeficÃcia <b>erga</b> omnesâ). It is also analyzed the possibility of manipulation, especially in time, {{of the effects of the}} Supreme Courtâs decisions in ADIn (direct action of unconstitutionality &# 8213; âaÃÃo direta de inconstitucionalidadeâ) and ADC (declaratory action of constitutionality &# 8213; âaÃÃo declaratÃria de constitucionalidadeâ), supported by the principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Finally, it is sustained the necessity of overriding the applicability of the binding effect and the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> efficacy in some exceptional situations, also based on the principles of proportionality and reasonableness. The use of the distinguishing technique is advocated. Some cases in which the Supreme Court itself and other Superior Courts did that are commented on and held as paradigmatic in order to guide the decisions all over the country in future analogous situationsAs decisÃes da Suprema Corte brasileira (STF) proferidas no controle abstrato de constitucionalidade provocam um enorme impacto em todo o paÃs, porquanto seus efeitos atingem a todos.

Assim, alguns sÃo sujeitos ao efeito vinculante &# 8213; como todos os ÃrgÃos administrativos e todos os juÃzes, tirante a prÃpria Suprema Corte &# 8213;, ao passo que outros &# 8213; como os legisladores, no exercÃcio de seu poder legiferante &# 8213; simplesmente nÃo o sÃo.

40|$|The need to {{regulate}} the potential for concurrent jurisdiction among States interested in prosecuting international crimes – such as genocide, crime against humanity, war crimes, and torture – might be satisfied by relying {{on the concept of}} <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations. This concept is intended to protect fundamental community values by way of individual State action. The same values are undermined by international crimes. One of the means of <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations enforcement is substitution between States less and less linked to a certain breach of community interests. It seems that contemporary international law is gradually coming to terms with this solution even in the field of international criminal justice. In fact, both in the relationship among States inter se and between States and international criminal tribunals, international law seems to distinguish primary from secondary claims to jurisdiction over international crimes and set the legal requirements for substitution among them. Within each class of relationship these requirements seem identical, but require further clarification by relevant practice...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to clarify the status in {{international}} law of countermeasures by non-injured States in the enforcement of norms protecting fundamental community values. For this purpose, the thesis examines two sub-questions: First, whether {{and to what extent}} countermeasures by non-injured States as a response to violations of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are tolerated in contemporary international law. By employing the concept of toleration introduced by Judge Simma in his separate declaration in the ICJ s 2010 Advisory Opinion, {{the question is not whether}} countermeasures in the general interest are legal, but rather whether they are not illegal. Understood as a property of fundamental norms, instantiations of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are more easily identified through the better-developed concept of jus cogens. The prohibitions on genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are all peremptory norms owed <b>erga</b> <b>omnes.</b> In addition, the prohibition on genocide entails a positive extra-territorial duty to prevent genocide and there are indications that the same applies to serious war crimes and crimes against humanity. Despite the International Law Commission s compromise solution in its 2001 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, existing State practice and opinio juris reveal a strong argument for the toleration of countermeasures by non-injured States in response to serious breaches of peremptory norms. Further, the legal regime regulating the measures and State practice do not lend strong support to the arguments against countermeasures in the general interest based on the risks of abuse inherent in self-assertion. Lastly, although international law contains a framework for extending countermeasures beyond principally responsible States, this extension reveals some legitimacy concerns for countermeasures by non-injured States in the general interest. The second sub-question of the thesis deals with the relationship between individual measures and collective enforcement of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes.</b> It examines enforcement through the United Nations (UN) in light of the Responsibility to Protect policy developed since the 2005 World Summit. In this respect, the public law ideal of collective enforcement of community norms leaves a residual role for individual measures. Furthermore, in cases where there is need to coordinate responses or secure legitimacy, the UN General Assembly is competent to assume a more prominent role in recommending individual countermeasures by non-injured States...|$|R
40|$|LL. D. Millions {{of human}} {{lives have been}} {{affected}} by gross human rights violations since 1945. Genocide and crimes against humanity have been perpetrated repeatedly against civilians despite the vow after the Holocaust that such atrocities would “never again” occur. The Holocaust acts were not criminalised as “genocide” in the London Charter, but as “persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds” under the broader international crime of “crimes against humanity”. “Genocide” was criminalised on 9 December 1948 by the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by the United Nations General Assembly. Two main obligations were imposed on signatory states by Article I of the Genocide Convention, namely to prevent the commission of the international crime of genocide, and the obligation to punish the perpetrators of such a crime. Both genocide and crimes against humanity form part of the “most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”, which are also gross human rights violations. It is of interest to all states of the international community to prevent the commission of these gross human rights violations and to prosecute perpetrators. The prohibition of the international crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity is <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> in nature. The research objective of this doctoral thesis is to analyse the causes for the repeated failure of the international community to fulfil the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligation to prevent and prosecute gross human rights violations. This endeavour is furthermore aimed at formulating recommendations that will enhance future compliance with the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligation in accordance with the international legal developments that will form {{the subject matter of the}} thesis.
