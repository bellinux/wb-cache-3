60|$|How {{pleasant}} {{the twilight}} that welled up {{from under the}} <b>low</b> <b>eaves,</b> above which we were seated. And how obvious now {{the design of the}} roof. No shade more grateful and complete; the garish sun lingering without like some lackey in waiting.|$|R
50|$|Exterior roof {{panels are}} usually a single {{continuous}} length from eave to ridge line for gable style buildings or from <b>low</b> <b>eave</b> to high eave on single slope or shed style buildings. Many manufacturers provide minimum 24 gauge (nominal: 0.0239 inch; 0.61 mm) thick sheet steel in self-framing roof designs.|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{passed the}} paper {{across the table}} in silence. The room seemed to her to have grown very still. She could hear the flies buzzing on the panes, the soft purr of the wind about the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> and through the apple boughs, the jerky beating of her own heart. She felt frightened and nervous, but resolute.|$|R
50|$|Saint Mary's Chapel, {{also known}} as Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, is a {{historic}} Episcopal church located on Rushmore Avenue between Roslyn Avenue and Glen Cove Avenue in Carle Place, Nassau County, New York. It was built in 1926, and is a one-story, rectangular, Tudor Revival style church building. It has a steeply pitched gable roof and <b>low</b> <b>eaves.</b> It features half-timbering on the stucco exterior and a small projecting vestibule.|$|R
25|$|Previously, wasps of D. norwegica {{were rarely}} {{considered}} to be pests. The built their nest far from human activity and rarely visited buildings, picnics and fruits. However, if their nests were built on a hedge, <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> or close to humans, {{it was best to}} remove the nests. Although they are less aggressive than other wasps in the Vespulagenus, individuals of D. norwegica will aim to protect their nest with their stingers.|$|R
50|$|The {{common myna}} is a hollow-nesting species; that is, it nests and breeds in {{protected}} hollows found either naturally in trees or artificially on buildings (for example, recessed windowsills or <b>low</b> <b>eaves).</b> Compared to native hollow-nesting species, the common myna is extremely aggressive, and breeding males will actively defend areas ranging up to 0.83 hectares in size (though males in densely populated urban settings tend to only defend the area immediately surrounding their nests).|$|R

60|$|Through narrow, stinking alleys, {{black as}} Erebus, he groped, {{and then up}} a rickety stairway, {{at the end of}} which was a closed door and a tiny, {{unglazed}} window. The window was high under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> of the mud building. Tarzan could just reach the sill. He raised himself slowly until his eyes topped it. The room within was lighted, and at a table sat Rokoff and Gernois. Gernois was speaking.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, {{he could}} see all that {{there was to be}} seen, far and near. Excellent eyes! The only thing they could not {{penetrate}} was the dark oblong of the doorway on the veranda under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> of the bungalow's roof. And that was vexing. It was an outrage. Ricardo was easily outraged. Surely she would come out presently! Why didn't she? Surely the fellow did not tie her up to the bedpost before leaving the house! ...|$|R
50|$|His first {{church was}} {{designed}} for St John's College in Hastings (1954-56). This led to the commission of a Marist chapel in Karori, Wellington. This project, the Chapel of Futuna (1958-61) is arguably the best work of his career, and is recognised nationally and internationally. The chapel incorporates ideas from a whare - a central pole, ribs of rafters and <b>low</b> <b>eaves.</b> The building won the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal in 1968, and the first 25-year Award in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Dirleton Parish Church, {{dedicated}} to St.Andrew, was built soon after Sir Thomas' plea of 1612. Colin McWilliam describes the church [...] "It {{is long and}} wide, with round-headed windows under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves.</b> The s side and roof are interrupted by the pedimented aisle built of ashlar by James Maxwell, Earl of Dirleton. It has a stone roof nicely supported along the eaves by stone brackets, and between the rusticated corner piers a looped-traceried window. On the e side, a pedimented doorway" ...|$|R
50|$|Elawa Farm, Lake Forest, Illinois, Neo-Georgian farm {{complex for}} A. Watson Armour, 1917, {{built as a}} weekend house Armour, an heir of the Armour and Company meatpacking fortune, lived on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. The {{projected}} main house, designed by David Adler in neo-Georgian style, to which the farm group was expressly suited, was never built; instead paired gatehouses were linked to the farm group by extensive gardens. <b>Low</b> <b>eaved</b> pitched roofs and linking covered passageways characterize Hopkins' symmetrically-massed brick farm group at Elawa Farms.|$|R
50|$|At the wonderfully well {{preserved}} {{stone house}} at Knap of Howar on the Orkney island of Papa Westray (occupied from 3500 BC to 3100 BC) the walls stand to a <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> height, {{and the stone}} furniture is intact. Evidence from middens shows that the inhabitants kept cattle, sheep and pigs, farmed barley and wheat and gathered shellfish, as well as fishing for species which must be caught from boats using lines. Finely made and decorated Unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield, including Balbrindi and Eilean Domhnuill.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} our earnest {{requests}} {{to see the}} queen, we were now conducted to an edifice, {{by far the most}} spacious, in the inclosure. It was at least one hundred and fifty feet in length, very wide, with <b>low</b> <b>eaves,</b> and an exceedingly steep roof of pandannas leaves. There were neither doors nor windows--nothing along the sides but the slight posts supporting the rafters. Between these posts, curtains of fine matting and tappa were rustling, all round; some of them were festooned, or partly withdrawn, so as to admit light and air, and afford a glimpse now and then {{of what was going on}} within.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{stone house}} still {{standing}} in northern Europe (occupied from 3500 BC to 3100 BC) is at Knap of Howar {{on the island}} of Papa Westray, with walls intact to a <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> height, and stone furniture looking very usable. Finely made and decorated Unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby. Similar houses at Skara Brae on the Mainland are grouped into a village linked by low passageways, and date from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC. Pottery found here is of the grooved ware style which was found at the Standing Stones of Stenness, close to the exceptional Maeshowe passage grave type chambered cairn of about the same period.|$|R
5000|$|The {{houses are}} large, with {{three to four}} storeys {{encompassed}} between the <b>low</b> <b>eaves,</b> and historically intended to house large extended families and a highly efficient space {{for a variety of}} industries. The densely forested mountains of the region still occupy 96% of all land in the area, and prior to the introduction of heavy earth-moving machinery, the narrow bands of flat lands running the length of the river valley limited the area available for agriculture and homestead development. The upper storeys of the gasshō houses were usually set aside for sericulture, while the areas below the first (ground) floor were often used for the production of nitre, one of the raw materials needed for the production of gunpowder.|$|R
60|$|I almost {{expected}} to see Patty come tripping down from the vine-covered porch with her needlework in her hand, and the house seemed strangely empty without her. Mr. Swain had his negro, Romney, place chairs for us under the apple tree, and bring out pipes and sangaree. The air was still, and heavy with the flowers' scent, {{and the sun was}} dipping behind the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> of the house. It was so natural to be there that I scarce realized all that had happened since last I saw the back gate in the picket fence. Alas! little Patty would never more be smuggled through it and over the wall to Marlboro' Street. Mr. Swain recalled my thoughts.|$|R
60|$|The day wore away, {{and even}} through the {{twilight}} {{they could see the}} lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the <b>low</b> Dutch <b>eaves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A gablet roof {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} both the gable and the hip roof while adding additional architectural interest. A drawback of a hip framed roof is its reduced attic space for a given roof pitch compared to a simple gable roof. In Mediterranean climates with lower snow loads high roof pitches and their greater consumption of materials and labor are unnecessary. Simple gable roofs are also problematic, as the lower <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> {{made possible by a}} shallow pitched hip roof provide the opportunity for both shade and rain protection {{in the form of an}} overhang or latticed porch. The shade these create keeps a structure cooler, their covered space is an attractive place for relaxation and escape from heat trapped inside, and the rain [...] "shadow" [...] created by overhangs greatly reduces the moisture content of the soil. This inhibits both foundation decay and subterranean termites common in these areas.|$|R
60|$|The canal {{is formed}} {{on the south}} by a pier or {{causeway}} with a parapet. At the far end the parapet stops, and the quay expands into an oblong peninsula in the lagoon, the breathing-place and summer parlour of the king. The midst is occupied by an open house or permanent marquee--called here a maniapa, or, as the word is now pronounced, a maniap'--at the lowest estimation forty feet by sixty. The iron roof, lofty but exceedingly low-browed, so that a woman must stoop to enter, is supported externally on pillars of coral, within by a frame of wood. The floor is of broken coral, divided in aisles by the uprights of the frame; the house far enough from shore to catch the breeze, which enters freely and disperses the mosquitoes; and under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> the sun is seen to glitter and the waves to dance on the lagoon.|$|R
60|$|Heyst did really light a cheroot {{before going}} out {{again on the}} veranda. He glanced up from under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves,</b> to see by the stars how the night went on. It was going very slowly. Why it should have irked him he did not know, for {{he had nothing to}} expect from the dawn; but {{everything}} round him had become unreasonable, unsettled, and vaguely urgent, laying him under an obligation, but giving him no line of action. He felt contemptuously irritated with the situation. The outer world had broken upon him; and {{he did not know what}} wrong he had done to bring this on himself, any more than he knew what he had done to provoke the horrible calumny about his treatment of poor Morrison. For he could not forget this. It had reached the ears of one who needed to have the most perfect confidence in the rectitude of his conduct.|$|R
60|$|With {{that weird}} vision of {{something}} questionably human impressed upon his senses, Heyst moved on a pace or two. What could the people be who {{had such a}} creature for their familiar attendant? He stopped. The vague apprehension, of a distant future, in which he saw Lena unavoidably separated from him by profound and subtle differences; the sceptical carelessness which had accompanied {{every one of his}} attempts at action, like a secret reserve of his soul, fell away from him. He no longer belonged to himself. There was a call far more imperious and august. He came up to the bungalow, and at the very limit of the lantern's light, on the top step, he saw her feet and the bottom part of her dress. The rest of her person was suggested dimly as high as her waist. She sat on a chair, and the gloom of the <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> descended upon her head and shoulders. She didn't stir.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Oscar Owre was a {{professor}} at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry. The house is generally cube-shaped but extends outward through a series of porches. The front porch is glassed-in and provides {{a good view of the}} lake. It shares some design features with the nearby William Gray Purcell House, including the <b>low,</b> overhanging <b>eaves,</b> bands of windows, and the side entry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I am dreadfully thirsty," [...] said Ida, who {{was always}} {{practical}} and never as enthusiastic over anything as Mary was. Yet she, too, felt a keen pleasure in {{the beauty of the}} scene before them. Almost at their feet lay the sea, creaming and shimmering in the mellow sunshine. Beyond, on either hand, stretched rugged brown cliffs and rocks, here running out to sea in misty purple headlands, there curving into bays and coves that seemed filled up with sunlight and glamour and pearly hazes; a beautiful shore and, seemingly, a lonely one. The only house visible from where the girls stood was a tiny grey one, with odd, <b>low</b> <b>eaves</b> and big chimneys, that stood down in the little valley on their right, where the cliffs broke away to let a brook run out to sea and formed a small cove, on whose sandy shore the waves lapped and crooned within a stone's throw of the house. On either side of the cove a headland made out to sea, curving around to enclose the sparkling water as in a cup.|$|R
60|$|IT WAS just in {{the middle}} of the merry, mellow {{afternoon}} that they ushered us to dinner, underneath a green shelter of palm boughs; open all round, and so <b>low</b> at the <b>eaves</b> that we stooped to enter.|$|R
60|$|Alec {{produced}} a home-made wooden shovel {{and an old}} iron one. With these he and Pat soon cleared a space {{in front of the}} cabin. Then the others, armed with snow-shoes and an old slab, went to work with a will and soon Smugglers' Hollow rang with the laughter and shouts of the merry crew. It was not far to the spring, and the task of digging out and trampling down a path was not difficult. When they finished Walter and Hal turned for their first good look at the surroundings. It was a wilderness of white broken only by the thin column of smoke from the cabin chimney, and the figures of their comrades busy at the wood-pile and storehouse. The cabin itself was nearly buried in snow, which was more than half-way to the <b>low</b> <b>eaves.</b> It had drifted quite over the little shack where Pat and Alec were at work. All tracks had been obliterated and for a few minutes it was difficult for them to get their bearings, so changed was the landscape. Then one by one they picked out the landmarks they had learned to know so well in the fall, but which now were so changed as to be hardly recognized.|$|R
6000|$|The house {{stood with}} its back, as it were, {{to the river}} and the only landing-stage; the main {{entrance}} was on the other side, and looked down the long island garden. The visitors approached it, therefore, by a small path running round nearly three sides of the house, close under the <b>low</b> <b>eaves.</b> Through three different windows on three different sides they looked in on the same long, well-lit room, panelled in light wood, with a large number of looking-glasses, and laid out as for an elegant lunch. The front door, when they came round to it at last, was flanked by two turquoise-blue flower pots. It was opened by a butler of the drearier type--long, lean, grey and listless--who murmured that Prince Saradine was from home at present, but was expected hourly; the house being kept ready for him and his guests. The exhibition of the card with the scrawl of green ink awoke a flicker of life in the parchment face of the depressed retainer, and it was with a certain shaky courtesy that he suggested that the strangers should remain. [...] "His Highness may be here any minute," [...] he said, [...] "and would be distressed to have just missed any gentleman he had invited. We have orders always to keep a little cold lunch for him and his friends, and I am sure he would wish it to be offered." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{ascended the}} river-bank, {{greeted by the}} usual {{accidents}} of an African reception; the men shouted, the women rushed screaming under cover, and the children stood howling at the horrible sight. A few paces placed us at the [...] "palace," [...] a heap of huts, surrounded by an old reed-fence. The audience-room was a trifle larger than usual, with <b>low</b> shady <b>eaves,</b> a half-flying roof, {{and a pair of}} doorways for the dangerous but indispensable draught; a veteran sofa and a few rickety chairs composed the furniture, and the throne was known by its boarded seat, which would have been useful in taking a [...] "lamp-bath." ...|$|R
60|$|While thus {{employed}} {{for months at}} a time surveying the lands beyond the Blue Ridge, he was often an inmate of Greenway Court. The projected manor house was never even commenced. On a green knoll overshadowed by trees was a long stone building one story in height, with dormer-windows, two wooden belfries, chimneys studded with swallow and martin coops, and a roof sloping down in the old Virginia fashion, into <b>low</b> projecting <b>eaves</b> that formed a verandah the whole length of the house. It was probably the house originally occupied by his steward or land agent, but was now devoted to hospitable purposes and the reception of guests.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} and interior of the house incorporate typical Prairie School elements found in most of Wright's designs of the era: broad overhanging cantilevered <b>eaves,</b> <b>low</b> hip roofs, bands of casement windows, Roman brick in the fireplace and hearth, vertical wooden slats creating a screen to hide the stairway, built-in exterior planters, and an overall emphasis on horizontal lines throughout.|$|R
60|$|The Avonlea {{school was}} a {{whitewashed}} building, <b>low</b> in the <b>eaves</b> and wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk {{in the morning to}} keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.|$|R
50|$|The Isabel Roberts {{house is}} {{sometimes}} credited {{as being the}} first split-level house. It also has features typical of Wright’s mature Prairie style, including broad overhanging <b>eaves,</b> <b>low</b> hip roofs, continuous bands of windows which he called “light screens”, an emphatic water table, cruciform plan, large fireplace surrounded by Roman brick, built-in bookcases, stained woodwork, a tree growing through the roof, elimination of basement and attic space, and an overall emphasis on the horizontal line. Wright’s Vosburgh House is similar in conception to the Isabel Roberts house.|$|R

It was probably the house originally occupied by his steward or land agent, but was now devoted to hospitable purposes, and the reception of guests. As to his lordship, it was one of his many eccentricities, that he never slept in the main edifice, but lodged apart in a wooden house not much above twelve feet square. In a small building was his office, where quitrents were given, deeds drawn, and business transacted with his tenants.|$|R
