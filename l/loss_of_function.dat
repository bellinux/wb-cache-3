5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function,</b> the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E

Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E

5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|PTEN and p27 <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> {{mutations}} {{are associated}} with a good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E

25|$|Further {{heterogeneity}} of ion channels arises when channels with different constitutive subunits {{give rise to}} a specific kind of current.

25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Aging of the {{population}} is accompanied by many challenges, such as the maintenance of health and quality of life during older age. An important aspect of living longer is that old age is related to disease and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions.</b> The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> brain <b>functions</b> poses a large problem in older age. Changes that occur in the brain can already be visualized when no symptoms or clinical disease are apparent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to visualize subtle brain changes. The subclinical brain changes can however be used as markers of future clinical disease. Furthermore, subclinical, subtle changes in brain function can cause considerable discomfort in daily living...|$|R
25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many human tumors {{occur because}} of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher {{susceptibility}} to inhibitors of mTOR. Deregulations of multiple {{elements of the}} mTOR pathway, like PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function,</b> AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E overexpression have been related to many types of cancers. Therefore, mTOR is an interesting therapeutic target for treating multiple cancers, both the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.|$|E

In {{patients}} with NF2 and ependymomas, the tumor suppressant function of Merlin may be compromised. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> mutations occurring in chromosome 22q, where Merlin proteins are coded, can promote tumorigenesis, or {{the creation of new}} tumorous cells. Deletions, too, in the NH2-terminal domain of merlin proteins have been associated with early tumor onset and poor prognosis in affected patients.|$|E
