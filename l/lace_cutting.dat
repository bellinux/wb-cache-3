40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mainly used for decorative purpose in the textile industry, lace {{is a type of}} lightweight, openwork fabric. The process of lace manufacturing is complex but much of it has been highly automated with the advancement of modern technology. One exception is the <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> operation which is used to cut the wide lace webs (as wide as 3. 8 m) knitted from automatic knitting machines into individual lace breadths. Currently, <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> IS carried out by skilled operators or a low speed mechanical cutting system, leading to high cost and increased product lead times. Therefore the <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> operation has become a bottleneck of the whole process oflace manufacturing and its automation is highly desired. Based on the combination of machine vision and laser cutting technology, two automatic <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> systems have been developed in Loughborough University, which have fully demonstrated the feasibility of replacing the slow and expensive traditional <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> methods. However, the edge quality of the lace cut by these systems is not satisfactory enough to meet the requirements of demanding lace markets. In this thesis, based on the investigation of the effect of handling tension on <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> edge quality and the microstructure of lace, a strategic <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> solution has been presented. The cutting strategy is aimed at tensioning and exposing the loop thread by strategically tensioning and cutting individual threads. The loop thread is considered critical to cutting lace with a high quality finish. To automatically implement the cutting strategy, a machine vision system has been developed. An automatic lace transport and tensioning rig has been designed and manufactured. The long term aim of this rig {{is to be able to}} transport and tension lace continuously for <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> and apply localised tension on individual threads with the vision system providing feedback for tension control. The work in this thesis has been limited to manual adjustment of the rig to prove the initial ideas for this concept. An integrated vision guided, pulsed laser cutting system for <b>lace</b> <b>cutting</b> has been developed, based on which two types of representative lace have been cut. According to the assessment results of using a combination of user trials, microscopic and newly developed measurement techniques, the lace cut by this newly developed system has shown significant improvement in cutting edge quality, when compared to the lace cut by the previous laser cutting systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — It is {{observed}} that garment elastic cutting methods {{are not fully}} successful due to the given measurement for elastic length was not cut properly. And also no such machine in an Indian make. The main objective of this proposed system is to avoid elastic shrinkage problem and reduces the machine cost and also save the machine importing cost. This machine is particularly useful for small and medium size serial productions, where flexible and automated cutting solutions for Elastic and VELCRO tape are required. This ERS (Elastic, Rope, and Shoe <b>lace)</b> <b>cutting</b> machine provides a best cutting solution for garment technology with cheapest price...|$|E

5000|$|Professor for {{addiction}} research Heino Stöver {{notes that}} the shops {{can be seen as}} a political statement, advancing drug legalization [...] "from below". The results of these markets are higher quality and lower prices of psychoactive substances as well as a lower risk of violent incidents. A number of studies suggest that markets such as Silk Road may have helped users reduce the harm caused by illicit drug use, particularly compared with street-based drug marketplaces. Examples include the sale of high-quality products with low risk for contamination (including <b>lacing</b> and <b>cutting),</b> vendor-tested products, sharing of trip reports, and online discussion of harm reduction practices. Some health professionals such as [...] "DoctorX" [...] provide information, advice and drug-testing services on the darknet. The quality of products is attributed to the competition and transparency of darknet markets which involve user feedback and reputation features.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rubber}} pad forming process only a milled lower die is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} lower die is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes rubber pad pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional <b>cutting,</b> <b>lace,</b> welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with rubber pad forming.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{research}} results of women’s headwear, which was discovered during archaeological excavations the necropolis at Verhneposadskaya St. Nicholas Church in Nizhny Novgorod. The {{structure of the}} textile and <b>lace,</b> the headwear <b>cutting,</b> the location of lace, {{and the time of}} its creation have been determined in the course of study. Most attention has been given to the gold-metallic threads. Technological classification of goldmetallic archaeological threads from different historical periods is considered in the article. The headwear was made of gold brocade of tinsel thread. It {{can be attributed to the}} mid or low value for the price. At the same time the good quality threads were used in the silver lace. According to the analysis of types and kinds of women’s headgear in Western fashion the time of creation a cap under study is determined as the middle or second half of the XVIII century. Dating is supported by results of the lace research. It is a typical XVIII century fan-shaped agramant named «vilyushka». Overall research results became a possible reconstruction of headdress. It is a small cap decorated with metallic lace along a bottom edge and the axis of symmetry of the forehead to the nape of the neck...|$|R
