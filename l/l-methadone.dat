40|$|Pharmacological {{differences}} among opioid drugs {{have been observed}} in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, as well as clinically, implying that all opioids may not be working through the same mechanism of action. Here we demonstrate analgesic synergy between <b>L-methadone</b> and several opioid ligands. Of the compounds examined, <b>L-methadone</b> selectively synergizes with morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, codeine, and the active metabolite of heroin, 6 -acetylmorphine. Mor-phine synergizes only with <b>L-methadone.</b> In analgesic assays, D-methadone was inactive alone and did not enhance morphine analgesia when the two were given together, confirming that <b>L-methadone</b> was not acting through N-methyl-D-aspartate mechanisms. Both <b>L-methadone</b> and morphine displayed only additive effects when paired with oxymorphone, oxycodone...|$|E
40|$|Sixty d,l- or <b>l-methadone</b> treated {{patients}} in maintenance therapy were interviewed for additional {{drug abuse and}} psychiatric comorbidity; 51. 7 % of the entire population had a comorbid Axis-I disorder, with a higher prevalence in females (P= 0. 05). Comorbid patients tended to have higher abuse of benzodiazepines, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine, but not of heroin. They had received a significantly lower d,l- (P&lt; 0. 05) and <b>l-methadone</b> dose than non-comorbid subjects. The duration of maintenance treatment showed an inverse relationship to frequency of additional heroin intake (P&lt; 0. 01). Patients with additional heroin intake over the past 30 days had been treated with a significantly lower <b>l-methadone</b> dosage (P&lt; 0. 05) than patients without. Axis-I comorbidity appears to be decreased when relatively higher dosages of d,l- (and <b>l-methadone)</b> are administered; comorbid individuals, however, were on significantly lower dosages. Finally, l-, but not d,l-methadone {{seems to be more}} effective in reducing additional heroin abuse...|$|E
40|$|Key pecking by 3 pigeons was {{maintained}} by a multiple fixed-ratio 10, fixed-ratio 30, fixed-ratio 90 schedule of food presentation. Components differed {{with respect to}} amount of reinforcement, such that the unit price was 10 responses per 1 -s access to food. Acute administration of morphine, <b>l-methadone,</b> and cocaine dose-dependently decreased overall response rates {{in each of the}} components. When a rate decreasing dose of morphine was administered daily, tolerance, as measured by an increase in the dose that reduced response rates to 50 % of control (i. e., the ED 50 value), developed in each of the components; however, the degree of tolerance was smallest in the fixed-ratio 90 component (i. e., the ED 50 value increased the least). When the <b>l-methadone</b> dose-effect curve was redetermined during the chronic morphine phase, the degree of cross-tolerance conferred to <b>l-methadone</b> was similar across components, suggesting that behavioral variables may not influence the degree of cross-tolerance between opioids. During the chronic phase, the cocaine dose-effect curve shifted to the right for 2 pigeons and to the left for 1 pigeon, which is consistent with predictions based on the lack of pharmacological similarity between morphine and cocaine. When the morphine, <b>l-methadone,</b> and cocaine dose-effect curves were redetermined after chronic morphine administration ended, the morphine and <b>l-methadone</b> ED 50 s replicated those obtained prior to chronic morphine administration. The morphine data suggest that the fixed-ratio value (i. e., the absolute output) determines the degree of tolerance and not the unit price...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the relationship between}} the plasma concentration of <b>l-methadone</b> and response to methadone in real-world patients, in order to identify a minimum plasma concentration above which methadone treatment is effective. Ninety-four patients with opioid dependence under maintenance methadone treatment were consecutively recruited. Response was defined as negative urine analyses in the three weeks prior to the blood sampling. The percentage of participants with a plasma <b>l-methadone</b> concentration between 100 and 250 ng/ml was 54. 2 % among those with a methadone dosage...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{concentrations}} of alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG), albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total proteins, {{as well as}} the plasma binding of racemic, d-methadone, and <b>l-methadone</b> were measured in 45 healthy subjects. The AAG phenotypes and the {{concentrations of}} AAG variants were also determined. The measured free fractions for racemic, d-methadone, and <b>l-methadone</b> were, respectively, 12. 7 % +/- 3. 3 %, 10. 0 % +/- 2. 9 %, and 14. 2 % +/- 3. 2 % (mean +/- SD). A significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio (B/F) for dl-methadone and the total AAG concentration (r = 0. 724; p less than 0. 001). A multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that AAG was the main explanatory variable for the binding of the racemate. When concentrations of AAG variants were considered, a significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio of dl-methadone and orosomucoid 2 A concentration (r = 0. 715; p less than 0. 001), a weak correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid 1 S concentration (r = 0. 494; p less than 0. 001), and no correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid 1 F 1 concentration (r = 0. 049; not significant). Similar findings were obtained with the enantiomers. This study shows the importance of considering not only total AAG but also concentrations of AAG variants when measuring the binding of methadone and possibly of other drugs in plasma...|$|E
40|$|A robust CE {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} {{determination of the}} enantiomers of ketamine and norketamine in equine plasma is described. It is based upon liquid-liquid extraction of ketamine and norketamine at alkaline pH from 1 mL plasma followed by analysis of the reconstituted extract by CE {{in the presence of}} a pH 2. 5 Tris-phosphate buffer containing 10 mg/mL highly sulfated beta-CD as chiral selector. Enantiomer plasma levels between 0. 04 and 2. 5 microg/mL are shown to provide linear calibration graphs. Intraday and interday precisions evaluated from peak area ratios (n = 5) at the lowest calibrator concentration are < 8 and < 14 %, respectively. The LOD for all enantiomers is 0. 01 microg/mL. After i. v. bolus administration of 2. 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, the assay is demonstrated to provide reliable data for plasma samples of ponies under isoflurane anesthesia, of ponies premedicated with xylazine, and of one horse that received romifidine, <b>L-methadone,</b> guaifenisine, and isoflurane. In animals not premedicated with xylazine, the ketamine N-demethylation is demonstrated to be enantioselective. The concentrations of the two ketamine enantiomers in plasma are equal whereas S-norketamine is found in a larger amount than R-norketamine. In the group receiving xylazine, data obtained do not reveal this stereoselectivity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Methadone is {{a potent}} {{analgesic}} used to treat refractory cancer pain. It is administered as a racemic mixture, with the l-enantiomer being primarily a μ-receptor agonist, whereas the d-enantiomer is an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist and inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Dose requirements vary greatly among patients to achieve optimal pain control and to avoid the risk of adverse effects. The relationship between plasma and saliva methadone enantiomer concentrations was investigated to determine if saliva could be a substitute for plasma in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies for clinical monitoring and dose optimization of methadone in patients with advanced cancer. Methods: Patients with advanced cancer who were prescribed varying doses of oral methadone for pain management were recruited to obtain paired plasma and saliva samples. Pain scores were recorded {{at the time of}} sampling. The total and unbound plasma and saliva concentrations of the l- and d-enantiomers of methadone were quantified by using an HPLC-MS/ MS method. The relationship between plasma (total and unbound) and saliva concentrations were compared. The saliva-to-plasma concentration ratio was compared versus the dose administered and the time after dosing for both enantiomers. The association of methadone concentrations with reported pain scores was compared by using a Mann-Whitney U test for significance. Findings: Fifty patients receiving a mean dose of 11 mg/d of methadone provided 151 paired plasma and saliva samples. The median age of the population was 61 years with an interquartile range of 53 - 71 years with total body weight ranging from 59 - 88 kg. Median (interquartile) total plasma concentrations for l- and d-methadone were 50. 78 ng/mL (30. 6 – 113. 0 ng/mL) and 62. 0 ng/mL (28. 7 – 116. 0 ng/mL), respectively. Median (interquartile range) saliva concentrations for l- and d-methadone were 81. 5 ng/mL (28. 0 – 203. 2 ng/mL) and 44. 2 (16. 2 – 149. 7 ng/mL). No relationship could be established between plasma and saliva concentrations for l- and d-methadone (r 2 ¼ 0. 35 and 0. 25). The saliva-to-plasma concentration analyzed with the methadone dose showed higher saliva concentrations at lower doses. Dose-normalized saliva concentrations followed a similar pattern over time compared with plasma concentrations. No correlation was found between <b>l-methadone</b> plasma, dmethadone plasma, <b>l-methadone</b> saliva, d-methadone saliva concentrations, and pain score. Implications: Saliva concentration was not a better predictor of pain control than plasma concentration for dose optimization and monitoring studies of methadone in patients with cancer. Although the saliva-to-plasma ratio of the concentration of methadone enantiomers was stable across the dosing range, due to the variability in individual saliva-to-plasma ratios, saliva sampling may not be a valid substitute in pharmacokinetic studies of methadone in cancer.

40|$|Methadone is {{a potent}} {{lipophilic}} synthetic opioid that is effective {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain and perceived benefit in difficult pain control scenarios (especially in cases of neuropathic pain). The use of methadone in clinical practice is challenging however, due to the narrow therapeutic window and large inter- and intra-individual variability in therapeutic response. Quantitation of the enantiomers d- and <b>l-methadone</b> (d- and l-MTD) in plasma and saliva provides a basis for studying its pharmacokinetics in patients with cancer and for monitoring efficacy, toxicity and side-effects. This assay involves quantitation of the enantiomers of methadone using their respective deuterated internal standards, in plasma and saliva matrices with no impact of ion suppression in either matrix. The analytical recoveries of d- and l-MTD from the saliva collection devices (Salivette®) are optimised in this novel method with an accurate and simple extraction method employing dichloromethane. Optimal enantioselective separations were achieved using an α 1 -acid glycoprotein chiral stationary phase and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. Linearity was demonstrated over 0. 05 – 1000 µg/L for both enantiomers in plasma and in saliva with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 998. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined to be 0. 1 µg/L in plasma and saliva for d- and l-MTD. Accuracy of the method ranges from 100 % to 106 % even at the LLOQ and total precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, was between 0. 2 % and 4. 4 % for both analytes in both matrices. A simple one step extraction procedure resulted in recoveries greater than 95 % for both analytes, at concentrations as low as 0. 5 µg/L, from the Salivette®. The validated method was applied successfully in 14 paired plasma and saliva samples obtained from adult patients with cancer pain receiving methadone.

40|$|BACKGROUND Intravenous {{anaesthetic}} {{drugs are}} the primary means for producing general anaesthesia in equine practice. The ideal drug for intravenous anaesthesia has high reliability and pharmacokinetic properties indicating short elimination and lack of accumulation when administered for prolonged periods. Induction of general anaesthesia with racemic ketamine preceded by profound sedation has already an established place in the equine field anaesthesia. Due to potential advantages over racemic ketamine, S-ketamine has been employed in horses to induce general anaesthesia, but its optimal dose remains under investigation. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether 2. 5 mg/kg S-ketamine could be used as a single intravenous bolus to provide short-term surgical anaesthesia in colts undergoing surgical castration, and to report its pharmacokinetic profile. RESULTS After premedication with romifidine and <b>L-methadone,</b> the combination of S-ketamine and diazepam allowed reaching surgical anaesthesia in the 28 colts. Induction of anaesthesia as well as recovery were good to excellent in the majority (n = 22 and 24, respectively) of the colts. Seven horses required additional administration of S-ketamine to prolong the duration of surgical anaesthesia. Redosing did not compromise recovery quality. Plasma concentration of S-ketamine decreased rapidly after administration, following a two-compartmental model, leading to the hypothesis of a consistent unchanged elimination of the parent compound into the urine beside its conversion to S-norketamine. The observed plasma concentrations of S-ketamine at the time of first movement were various and did not support the definition of a clear cut-off value to predict the termination of the drug effect. CONCLUSIONS The administration of 2. 5 mg/kg IV S-ketamine after adequate premedication provided good quality of induction and recovery and a duration of action similar to what has been reported for racemic ketamine at the dose of 2. 2 mg/kg. Until further investigations will be provided, close monitoring to adapt drug delivery is mandatory, particularly once the first 10 minutes after injection are elapsed. Taking into account rapid elimination of S-ketamine, significant inter-individual variability and rapid loss of effect over a narrow range of concentrations a sudden return of consciousness has to be foreseen...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthetic induced {{inhibition}} of normal thermoregulation combined with cool operating room environment, results in peri- and postanaesthetic hypothermia in most surgical patients. Aim {{of this study}} was to determine whether a fluid warmer as a single active perianaesthetic warming method was capable to prevent or reduce perioperative hypothermia in dogs undergoing superficial, mainly orthopedic surgery. In this study sixty-seven dogs of different breeds undergoing seventy elective surgical procedures of longer than 60 Minutes were divided to two groups. One group received warmed intravenous crystalloid fluids (42 °C) via coaxial fluid warmer (Autotherm ®) in flow rate of 10 ml/kg/h, the other was observed as a control (room temperature crystalloid fluids). After a routine sedation with midazolam and <b>l-methadone,</b> induction with propofol for tracheal intubation was performed. All patients received general anaesthesia with isoflurane/oxygen. In both groups standard surgical draping was used and dogs were placed on an isolated operating table. Results of the deep rectal- and oesophageal temperatures were considered as body core temperature. The body temperature was measured during preoperative examination, at the induction, in five minute intervals during the intraoperative phase and during postanaesthetic recovery 5, 10, 30, 60 and 180 minutes after tracheal extubation. Posture, postoperative behaviour and incidence of postanaesthetic shivering were also evaluated. After a short moderate temperature elevation (0, 2 ± 0, 3 °C), probably due to mental excitement, during the anaesthesia induction, perianaesthetic body core temperature fell in both groups. The fall in core temperature was greatest during the first hour of anaesthesia. This likely reflected the redistribution of heat following the vasodilatation after anaesthesia induction. The classic pattern of perianaesthetic core temperature fall was observed in several cases in both groups. Dogs that received warmed intravenous fluids had a significantly higher body core temperature after 40 min until 130 min of anaesthesia. The present study demonstrated that warming intravenous fluids resulted at least 0, 4 °C (0, 4 - 1 °C) greater core temperature and a significantly lower grade of secondary hypothermia. The patients of the warm fluid group could be extubated significantly earlier than the control animals. Shivering was consistent in both groups, however it was observed more often in animals of the control group. We conclude that fluid warming combined with standard passive heat conservation methods, was effective in minimizing perianaesthetic hypothermia during superficial and orthopedic surgery in dogs, however it was not effective enough as a single method to maintain the perioperative normothermia...|$|E
