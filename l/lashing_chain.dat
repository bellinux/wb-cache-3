60|$|He {{watched her}} with his yellow eyes, from under his long black <b>lashes,</b> like some <b>chained</b> animal, haunted by doom. She turned and left him standing.|$|R
60|$|Morning dawned at last; the sea {{was green}} once more, the sky blue, and {{beautiful}} with the young, fresh light. He was lying on an old raft of black, water-logged spars and planks <b>lashed</b> together with <b>chains</b> and rotting ropes. But alas! there was no shore in sight, for all night long he had been drifting, drifting further and further away from land.|$|R
50|$|While the F650CS {{was similar}} to the GS {{released}} in 2000, it had several unique features including a single-sided swingarm, toothed belt drive, modular soft case baggage, and a storage area in what would traditionally be the top tank of the bike. The fuel tank was instead placed underneath the rear half of the seat, with the fuel filler cap on the right hand side of the rear of the bike.Traditionally, BMW has favored shaft drive, {{but for the first time}} chose belt drive for this application for its advantages in cost and weight over shaft drive, and because it did not require the frequent cleaning, lubrication, and adjustment of roller chain drive, as well as lasting longer than a chain and running quieter. Using belt drive was consistent with the intent to attract new motorcyclists who might not be comfortable with the mechanical chores normally associated with motorcycling. Though belt drives have greater power loss than chains, which are typical of high-performance motorcycles, they do not suffer from <b>chain</b> <b>lash,</b> since <b>chains</b> must be kept slightly loose but belts remain tight at all times, meaning the responsiveness of the drivetrain is comparable to a heavier and more costly shaft drive.|$|R
50|$|Fleeing from {{pursuing}} Chinese Nationalist forces, the communists {{found that there}} were not enough boats to cross the Dadu River (Sichuan province). Thus, they were forced to use Luding Bridge, a Qing dynasty suspension bridge built in 1701. The bridge consisted of thirteen heavy iron chains with a span of some 100 yards. Thick wooden boards <b>lashed</b> over the <b>chains</b> provided the roadway across the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Fath was {{apparently}} still governor of Jerusalem in 1029 and 1030. During both years, he supervised the Hoshana Rabbah festival at the Mount of Olives, {{one of the}} largest Jewish pilgrimage gatherings of the year at the time. During the 1029 festival, which was the first such festival to be held since the Jarrahid revolt of 1024, the Rabbinate religious establishment attempted to excommunicate members of the Karaite sect en masse. However, the move was voided by the intervention of the Jewish geonim leaders and local Fatimid governors, including Fath and al-Dizbari. The following year, al-Dizbari issued an edict warning the Rabbinates not to ban the Karaites and had Fath and his troops supervise the festival with <b>lashes</b> and <b>chains</b> prepared to deter such actions.|$|R
50|$|A {{steel rope}} was fixed from {{the stern of}} the Alhambra to the chains of the derelict, and it was {{proposed}} to send a diver down in order to <b>lash</b> the <b>chain</b> to the cable. The diver, however, found that he could not work from the north-eastern side of the derelict, on which the Alhambra was lying, and the captain decided to shift around to get the bow of his vessel to westward of the derelict. Arrangements were completed shortly before 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the steamer was just about bringing up to the desired position when she fouled the derelict about amidships. An attempt was made to alter the course of the steamer, but it was found that she had a huge hole knocked in her side. All attempts to stop the leak proved unavailing, and as the steamer was rapidly settling down, the crew took to the boats and reached the steamer Tasmania safely.|$|R
25|$|Team Cobra {{attacked}} at 0400 hours. They {{killed three}} guards, {{and drove the}} others away. Sergeant Te used bolt cutters to cut open <b>chains</b> <b>lashing</b> shut the bamboo bars. Phisit Intharathat, a former Thai commando, was released {{from one of the}} sunken cells. To Te's surprise, he found 82 prisoners instead of the expected 40. This overloaded the capacity of the arranged helilift extraction. An urgent radio call was forwarded through the relay aircraft orbiting overhead, appealing for more copters. Air America responded by waiving the usual two pilots per chopper rule, and pulling helicopters out of maintenance. Even as the call went through, some of the released locals dispersed towards their homes.|$|R
5000|$|Day 49: Because of her art skills, Erica was tasked {{to make a}} {{painting}} depicting Wayuk's relationship as her teammates pushed ahead with the penultimate night of the caroling. As daylight came, the Industrial housemates woke up to find pictures of their house in tatters, prompting everybody {{to clean up the}} place. However, two masked housekeepers suddenly came over to take away all of the other things still strewn about. They also discovered the refrigerator missing (secretly stashed at the Activity Area), saw plates full of rotten leftovers as reminders of their wastage, and Big Brother gave a lengthy sermon. He said they can get the refrigerator back if they can take off six locks connected to <b>chains</b> <b>lashed</b> around it. The matching keys, plus 34 other false keys, were hidden in a pool full of garbage. They unlocked the refrigerator and returned to the house to find a list of violations for the month at the dining table, with failing to heed bedtime calls, taking baths outside the shower call, and speaking with no lapel mics the most common items. On a signal, they were tasked to roll two giant dice to determine the nature of their punishments and who should receive it. Kim, Ryan, and Naprey were made to wear fake mouthpieces controlled by a ventriloquist (and must act out what they [...] "speak"), Luz was forced to take a bath three times (all her rolls had the same result) and Jessica planked at the living room. At the Luxury House, Seth continued to sit out the weekly task by talking to Big Brother at the confession room.|$|R
