5000|$|Construction {{work for}} the {{electric}} catenary started in the early 1960s. The construction of the facilities between Freiberg and Werdau was relatively unproblematic. However, the electrification between Dresden and Freiberg, especially around Edle Krone, was more difficult because restricted clearances hindered {{the construction of the}} catenary. The most important building project in this section was the widening of the Edle Krone tunnel, since the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> was impossible because of bridges connecting directly to the tunnel. Many catenary masts had to be constructed as special constructions with catenary supports over both tracks. The overhead was opened between 1963 and 1966 in sections starting from Werdau: ...|$|E
50|$|As of 1877, a steam tram ran in Wilhelmshöher Allee, {{originally}} {{crossing the}} railway {{at a level}} crossing next to Wahlershausen station. This was presumably deemed to interfere with operations so that in 1878/79 the railway was lowered by about six metres and a bridge was built over it carrying Wilhelmshöher Allee. The <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> meant that the platforms and the adjacent station had to be lowered. A retaining wall was built next to the station building and a staircase was built for passengers to pass to and from trains. In addition, a pedestrian bridge was built to the platforms. The Kassel-Waldkappel railway (also known as the Losse Valley Railway) was opened in 1879 with its own platform {{on the east side}} of Wilhelmshöhe station (today's platform 9/10).|$|E

50|$|On the {{southern}} {{side of the}} station, a double track line, located at a lower level, connects the Basel and Muttenz marshalling yards with the line to France, and is devoted mainly to through freight trains.Due to the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> {{at the time of}} rebuilding, it was difficult to extend the station with additional tracks. On the South side, the platform system has nevertheless been augmented several times: tracks 11 and 12 have been added, the pedestrian underpass has been extended to Gundeldingen, and, in 2003, the new Passerelle was constructed to the new tracks 14 and 15. These changes, together with the introduction of a clock-face timetable in 1982 and the Rail 2000 project, achieved an increase in the station's capacity. Finally, in June 2008, the new tracks 16 and 17 went into operation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} change in the development of Pleasantville came {{with the arrival of the}} New York Central Railroad and New York and Harlem Railroad in 1846. In the following year, a train station was built near the present corner of Bedford Road and Wheeler Avenue, and as a result the commercial center of Pleasantville shifted to its current location. The older business district at Bedford Road and Broadway is today called the Old Village. The railroad offered a speedier and more frequent connection with New York City—only 70 minutes away by rail, compared with a five-hour overland journey by stagecoach or a two-hour steamboat trip down the Hudson River. The present-day train station, which currently houses a restaurant, was built in 1905 and was moved to its present location in the 1950s to accommodate the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> below grade. Before the addition of the now heavily trafficked station, commuters working in New York City and lower Westchester County were forced to rely on rides from Marc Damon, now famous in Pleasantville for being [...] "The Friendly Coachman".|$|E

50|$|Between 5 February and 5 March 1979, {{plans for}} the (northern) section 3 were {{developed}} in the Mannheim town hall. A citizens' initiative against the project had formed.

40|$|The Inductrack {{magnetic}} levitation system, {{developed at the}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is being studied for its possible use for launching rockets. Under NASA sponsorship, a small model system is being constructed at the Laboratory to pursue key technical aspects of this proposed application. The Inductrack is a passive {{magnetic levitation}} system employing special arrays of high-field permanent magnets (Halbach arrays) on the levitating carrier, moving above a "track" consisting of a close-packed array of shorted coils with which are interleaved with special drive coils. Halbach arrays produce a strong spatially periodic magnetic field on <b>the</b> front surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrays, while canceling the field on their back surface. Relative motion between the Halbach arrays and <b>the</b> <b>track</b> coils induces currents in those coils. These currents levitate the carrier cart by interacting with <b>the</b> horizontal component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field. Pulsed currents in the drive coils, synchronized with <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier, interact with <b>the</b> vertical component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field to provide acceleration forces. Motional stability, including resistance to both vertical and lateral aerodynamic forces, is provided by having Halbach arrays that interact with both the upper and <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> coils.

40|$|Today’s bridge {{design work}} {{in many cases}} demands a {{trustworthy}} dynamic analysis instead <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> traditional dynamic amplification factors. In this thesis a reliable 3 D Bernoulli-Euler beam finite element model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Årsta Railway Bridge was prepared for thorough dynamic analysis using in situ bridge monitoring for correlation. <b>The</b> bridge is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete box girder type with a heavily reinforced and prestressed bridge deck. The monitoring system was designed for long term monitoring with strain transducers embedded in the concrete and accelerometers mounted inside the edge beams and at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> slab. <b>The</b> global finite element model used the exact bridge geometry but was simplified regarding prestressing cables and <b>the</b> two railway <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> prestressing cables and <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were consequently not included and an equivalent pure concrete model was identified. A static macadam train load was eccentrically placed on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge’s two <b>tracks.</b> By using Vlasov’s torsional theory and thereby including constrained warping a realistic modulus <b>of</b> elasticity for <b>the</b> concrete without prestressing cables and stiffness contribution from <b>the</b> railway <b>tracks</b> was found. This was allowed by comparing measured strain from strain transducers with the linear elastic finite element model’s axial stresses. Mainly three monitoring bridge sections were used, each of which was modelled with plane strain finite elements subjected to sectional forces/moments from a static macadam train load and a separately calculated torsional curvature. From <b>the</b> identified modulus <b>of</b> elasticity <b>the</b> global finite element model was updated for Poisson’s ratio and material density (mass) to correspond with natural frequencies from the performed signal analysis <b>of</b> accelerometer signals. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> warping on <b>the</b> natural frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global finite element model was assumed small and the bridge’s torsional behaviour was modelled to follow Saint-Venant’s torsional theory. A first preliminary estimation of modal damping ratios was included. The results indicated that natural frequencies were in accordance between modelling and signal analysis results, especially concerning high energy modes. Estimated damping ratios for the first vibration modes far exceeded the lower limit value specified in bridge design codes and railway bridge dynamic analysis recommendations. QC 2010112...|$|R
