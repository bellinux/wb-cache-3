40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a summary of}} the holdup and material control and accountability (MC&A) assays conducted for the determination of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) of Building 321 -M at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The 321 -M facility was the Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at SRS and was used to fabricate HEU fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the SRS production reactors. The facility operated for more than 35 years. During this time thousands of uranium-aluminum-alloy (U-Al) production reactor fuel tubes were produced. After the facility ceased operations in 1995, all of the easily accessible U-Al was removed from the building, and only residual amounts remained. The bulk of this residue was located in the equipment that generated and handled small U-Al particles and in the exhaust systems for this equipment (e. g., Chip compactor, casting furnaces, <b>log</b> <b>saw,</b> lathes A & B, cyclone separator, Freon{trademark} cart, riser crusher, [...] . etc). The D&D project is likely to represent an important example for D&D activities across SRS and across the Department of Energy weapons complex. The Savannah River National Laboratory was tasked to conduct holdup assays to quantify the amount of HEU on all components removed from the facility prior to placing in solid waste containers. The U- 235 holdup in any single component of process equipment must not exceed 50 g {{in order to meet the}} container limit. This limit was imposed to meet criticality requirements of the low level solid waste storage vaults. Thus the holdup measurements were used as guidance to determine if further decontamination of equipment was needed to ensure that the quantity of U- 235 did not exceed the 50 g limit and to ensure that the waste met the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) of the solid waste storage vaults. Since HEU is an accountable nuclear material, the holdup assays and assays of recovered residue were also important for material control and accountability purposes. In summary, the results of the holdup assays were essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to ensure that administrative criticality safety controls were not exceeded. This paper discusses the {gamma}-ray assay measurements conducted and the modeling of the acquired data to obtain measured holdup in process equipment, exhaust components, and fixed geometry scrap cans. It also presents development work required to model new acquisition configurations and to adapt available instrumentation to perform the assays...|$|E

30|$|The {{value of}} {{hardwood}} lumber is {{inversely proportional to}} the quantity and size of its defects, both internal and external. Hardwood, therefore has an appearance-based value. Due to this, log breakdown strategies tend to minimize defects in the resulting boards. Therefore, knowledge of internal defects in hardwood logs prior to log breakdown can be useful. It is in the log yard where the first important decision is made regarding the final use of the log. Based upon the external log characteristics, logs may be sorted as veneer <b>logs,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>logs</b> or pulpwood.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an industrial computed tomography scanner for the sawmilling industry {{raises the question of}} how to find a production strategy that uses a computed tomography scanner in the sawmill production line to its full potential. This study was focused on a Scandinavian sawmill processing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The potential value increase when allowing an alternative log rotation other than the horns down position was investigated using a log breakdown simulation. The resulting data was analysed with respect to the size of the log rotational step, an introduced rotational error of the sawing machine and different price differences between the quality grades. It was also of interest to define the outer log properties that characterise the <b>logs</b> <b>sawn</b> for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to <b>logs</b> <b>sawn</b> for a greater profit return in a different log rotation. Such characteristics can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an optimisation and consider instead other parameters, such as positioning and sawing pattern. Other defects such as pitch pockets, splits and rot are also of interest. The results shows that there is a potential value increase when applying the log rotation that maximises the value for each log instead of processing all logs in the horns down position. However, the potential value increase depends on the rotational error of the used sawing machine and the price differences between the quality grades. The log properties that differ between <b>logs</b> <b>sawn</b> for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to a different log rotation are the bow height and the log taper. Unfortunately, predictability of log rotation for greatest profit return based on the outer properties of logs is poor. It is not possible to differentiate logs which would be sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position from those where a different log rotation results in the greatest profit return, based only on their outer properties...|$|R
