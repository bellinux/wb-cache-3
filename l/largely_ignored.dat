5|$|Henry {{seems to}} have been known in {{northern}} Germany, but he was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Curtis as Charlie Bratley, the 13-year-old son of Officer Lou Bratley and {{his ex-wife}} Terri. Having been <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by his negligent mother, {{at the end}} of the film he is sent to live with Lou.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Dyson sphere {{originated}} in fiction, {{and it is}} a concept that has appeared often in science fiction since then. In fictional accounts, Dyson spheres are most often depicted as a Dyson shell with the gravitational and engineering difficulties of this variant noted above <b>largely</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|E
50|$|DSTV {{has yet to}} {{announce}} a schedule for repairing these issues, and <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> the many complaints.|$|R
5000|$|Mortimer: Hrab speaks on {{the phone}} with a codger named Mortimer ("I'm old"), who <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> him and rants on.|$|R
50|$|Kipling Sahib is a {{biography}} of Rudyard Kipling, by Charles Allen. It focuses primarily on Kipling's upbringing in India, and <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> his later life and work.|$|R
5|$|Castelli is <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> in the historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus {{instead on}} the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy, {{the chief}} medical officer aboard the Enterprise. Kelley had {{reservations}} with the script, feeling that the characters and relationships from the series were not in place. Along with Shatner and Nimoy, Kelley lobbied for greater characterization, but their opinions were <b>largely</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dressed in {{mourning}} {{for the remainder}} of her life, Queen Mary's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto, outlining James Francis Edward's claims. It was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> in England. In Scotland, however, the confederate Lords sent Lord Belhaven to Saint-Germain, to convince the Queen to surrender to them custody of James Francis Edward and accede to his conversion to Protestantism.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{members of}} the {{community}} used 'Panoriya' as their surname. In recent times many {{members of the}} community has taken surnames like Nayak, Adhikari and Tanti. They community <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> the varna hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|Usage started officially at 1 Chaitra 1879, Saka Era, or 22 March 1957. However, {{government}} officials seem to <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> the New Year's Day of this calendar {{in favour of}} the religious calendar.|$|R
50|$|Two main {{types of}} data {{assimilation}} (DA) are used: three-dimensional (3DDA) which <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> the information present in the temporal distribution of the observations; and four-dimensional (4DDA) which attempts {{to make use of}} it.|$|R
5|$|Exact {{publication}} {{figures are}} unavailable for this book, but a first printing {{of one of}} Heyer's novels in the British Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and each of her books generally sold over 500,000copies in paperback. As with Heyer's other popular fiction, this book was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by contemporary critics; only after her death did they begin to take more interest in her work.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, C. M. Sternberg was {{the first}} to {{question}} this and favoured instead that Triceratops was more closely related to Arrhinoceratops and Chasmosaurus based on skull and horn features, making Triceratops a ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) genus. He was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored,</b> with John Ostrom, and later David Norman both placing Triceratops within Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Saadiq {{released}} his debut solo album Instant Vintage, which received critical acclaim and earned him five Grammy Award nominations. However, despite attaining a following among listeners in Europe, it was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by contemporary R listeners in the United States {{and did not}} sell well. After its release, he was dropped by his record label Universal Records.|$|E
50|$|Pereboom calls {{positions}} 3 and 4 soft determinism, position 1 {{a form of}} hard determinism, position 6 a form {{of classical}} libertarianism, and any position that includes having F as compatibilism. He <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> position 2.|$|R
50|$|Owona and RDPC Secretary-General Joseph Charles Doumba had a poor relationship; by 2003 {{they had}} {{reportedly}} {{not been on}} speaking terms for years, and Biya was said to primarily work with Owona, while <b>largely</b> <b>ignoring</b> Doumba, who was in poor health.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 2 stars stating [...] "The rhythm section (pianist John Hicks, bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Andrew Cyrille) <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> the tenor's improvisations, making {{this one of}} David Murray's more forgettable recordings.".|$|R
5|$|Lamarck was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by {{the major}} French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are <b>largely</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts to liberate and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting {{based on their own}} interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E
40|$|American Studies is an {{academic}} discipline whose object of {{study is the}} United States of America and everything associated with it, and American sociologists <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> it. American Studies <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> American sociology. What causes this mutual exclusion? An outline of the disciplinary history of American Studies and journal article citation data show {{that the relationship between}} sociology and American Studies is weak and asymmetrical; American Studies cites sociology more often, but very little and not by much. I argue that mutual exclusion is due to mutual distrust in methods: sociology sees itself as a science, while American Studies, with roots in history and literature, does not. This article serves as a case study in the limits of interdisciplinarity...|$|R
25|$|Guinea baboon (Papio papio) males which live in gangs do {{not differ}} in their {{response}} behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males and <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.|$|R
30|$|Since sonic log-derived {{porosities}} <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> secondary porosity, such as fractures, and {{the density}} log responds {{primarily to the}} bulk porosity, the difference was {{used to calculate the}} fracture porosity, referred to as the secondary porosity index (SPI) of the reservoir (Schlumberger 1989).|$|R
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|Frank Marshall {{invented the}} Modern Benoni in 1927, but his {{experiments}} {{with the opening}} went <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> for over 20 years. In the 1950s the system was revitalized by players in the Soviet Union, chief among them Mikhail Tal. Its subsequent adoption by players of a similarly aggressive and uncompromising style such as Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov established the opening's {{reputation as one of}} Black's most dynamic responses to 1.d4.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
50|$|Guinea baboon (Papio papio) males which live in gangs do {{not differ}} in their {{response}} behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males and <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.|$|R
50|$|Paul Rouzer {{reads the}} poems as buddhist {{teaching}} poems, referring to Hakuin Ekaku Kanzan shi sendai kimon 寒山詩闡提記聞 (1746) ("Notes on the Lectures on Cold Mountain's Poems at Icchantika Cave") that <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> the biographical reading most {{commonly found in}} other sources.|$|R
5000|$|Althusser re-evaluates {{his past}} works, {{especially}} For Marx (1965) and Reading Capital (1965), criticizing them for <b>largely</b> <b>ignoring</b> the class struggle. He accordingly redefined philosophy, {{from being a}} [...] "theory of theoretical practice" [...] to being [...] "the class struggle in theory." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology was <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> {{by early}} {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Miami, Florida over a two-month period {{in the first half}} of 2008. Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic <b>largely</b> <b>ignored</b> by most of the Indian population. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, Dostana grossed over 871 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.|$|E
50|$|Sanderson {{also notes}} that Coogan - and his publisher, MonkeyBrain, who also publish Jess Nevins' {{annotations}} on Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - are not following the common trend in academic circles to <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> the superhero genre when comics are discussed.|$|R
50|$|Geezil's loathing for Wimpy {{grew and}} soon became his {{defining}} character trait, and Geezil is {{not shy about}} telling the portly scamster {{how he feels about}} him. Wimpy, for his part, seems to <b>largely</b> <b>ignore</b> Geezil's hostility—although he has often subtly retaliated by flustering and confusing Geezil.|$|R
40|$|Current photo-historiography <b>largely</b> <b>ignores</b> the {{influence}} on nineteenth century photographers of Alexander von Humboldt 2 ̆ 7 s co-examination of poetry, painting, and cultivation of exotic plants.
