5000|$|In {{his review}} of Everest 1933 (Ruttledge, 1941, first {{published}} in 1934), G. L. Corbett commended the book with the words, [...] "There are passages as fine as anything in Alpine literature." [...] When analysing the expedition's overall lack of success, he stated that although [...] "there has never been an attempt on a mountain more carefully prepared, more methodically directed", three things {{were responsible for the}} failure to reach Mount Everest's summit. First, the disagreements over the siting of Camp V and the resulting descent to Camp IV led to the loss of an unusually good climbing window between 20 and 22 May. As Raymond Greene later said, [...] "It may be that we lost not two days but twenty years." [...] The weather thereafter deteriorated sharply. Corbett places the blame squarely at the feet of Ruttledge, who should have been at Camp IV to direct operations, rather than lower down the mountain. Second, the instructions to Wager and Wyn-Harris to try to tackle the Second Step lost them valuable time, and even though they eventually decided to take Norton's <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> they were by no means convinced that the Step was unclimbable. Regarding the flexibility of their approach, Corbett quoted Smythe, who stated that [...] "Everest will only be climbed by a man who is single-minded in the matter of route, and any doubt or hesitancy in this respect must always lead to defeat." [...] Third, the fact that Smythe was forced to make his summit bid alone was directly attributable to Shipton falling ill on the attempt. Solo climbing, Corbett argued, [...] "is not a practice to be encouraged anywhere: on the last thousand feet of Everest, in dangerous condition, it is bad mountaineering".|$|E

In this work, AA 6082 /TiC surface AMC {{was produced by}} FSP technique {{and the effect of}} traverse speed on microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. The traverse speed was varied from 40 mm/min. to 80 mm/min. in steps of 20 mm/min. The rest of the process parameters such as groove width, tool rotational speed and axial force were kept constant. Micrographs of the AA 6082 /TiC AMCs were obtained using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Microhardness and wear behaviour of the surface composites were analysed. Results revealed that the traverse speed significantly influenced the area of surface composites, dispersion of TiC, grain size of matrix, microhardness, and wear rate of the AA 6082 /TiC AMCs. The traverse speed was inversely proportional to the area of surface composites. The homogenous distribution of TiC particles was attained with <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> speed, whereas poor distribution of TiC particles was influenced by the higher traverse speed. Also increase in the traverse speed of the surface composite enhanced microhardness and reduced the wear rate when compared with <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> speed...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis characterizes the residual stresses generated by {{friction stir welding}} of ODS steel MA 956 {{as a function of}} heat index. The heat index of a weld is used to determine relative heat input among different friction stir welding conditions. It depends on a combination of the rotational speed and traverse, or welding speed of the tool through the metal. Higher rotational speeds and <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> speeds increase heat index and are expected to result in lower residual stresses than welds performed with lower heat index. Three conditions with varying heat indices were selected from high to low: 500 rpm/ 25 millileters per minute (mmpm), 400 rpm/ 50 mmpm and 400 rpm/ 100 mmpm. The full stress tensor was determined for points across these welds using x-ray diffraction. Longitudinal residual stresses approximately 90 % of yield strength were observed for the lowest heat input condition. Stress profiles displayed the characteristic M shaped profile, and asymmetry between advancing and retreating stress peaks was limited, occurring mainly on the root of the weld. As expected, lowering the heat index of a weld increased the magnitude of residual stresses across the whole weld profile. Outstanding ThesisEnsign, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{microstructure}} and microhardness of the welded joints of the annealed aluminum alloy AA 7020 -O produced by {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) technique. The material was applied to {{post weld heat treatment}} (solution treatment and artificially aged, T 6). The traverse speed and the rotational speed are the most important process parameters of FSW, and have great influence on the heat input of the welding operation which governs the welded joints quality. To investigate their effect, the welding operation was performed using three traverse speeds, 20, 40 and 60 mm/s with two rotational speeds of 1125 and 1400 rpm, and other welding parameters were kept constant to produce comparable joints. It was found that the two rotational speeds are accepted with <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> speeds to produce sound joints. Microstructure of the welded joints was significantly affected by the FSW process parameters, and slight effect was reported for the grain size. Microhardness examination showed high weld joint quality with respect to the base metal hardness, which proves the reprecipitation of the hardening phase in the weld zone. The microhardness profile was strongly dependant on the rotational speed, and the average values of the joints hardness have increased with the decrease in the rotational speed, where it have been slightly affected by the welding speed...|$|E

Research should help to correct use of water jet technology in repair works on concrete structures especially after wildfires in tunnels, underground garages, etc., which are exposed to enormous thermal stress.

It was found, that both <b>lower</b> <b>traversing</b> velocity (cutting speed) and higher water pressure led to removal of higher amount of concrete. Higher temperature loading caused decrease of concrete strength and thus easier removal of surface layers by water jet.

Strong parameters {{have been selected}} to characterize and check viability of abrasiveless WJP; a water pressure of 360. MPa and two slow traverse velocities: 0. 05 and 0. 1. m/min. After processing, large number of pits with undercuts plus some larger intrusions are observed, which are more abundant and larger in the steel specimens and in those treated with the <b>lower</b> <b>traverse</b> speed. Cross sectional examination of 316 LVM reveals a significant grain size refinement in the subsurface zone, 10 - 20. μm wide, that exhibits a submicrometric/nanometric grain size, accompanied with a hardness gradient (50 % increase) that extends {{to a depth of}} up to about 100. μm. The analysis of the magnetic hysteresis loops discards the presence of strain induced α-martensite. No hardness or microstructural gradient was developed in the Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. The results indicate that in AISI 316 LVM the volume loss occurs through hardening of the subsurface, embrittlement, crack formation and erosion.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{modelling}} of {{friction stir welding}} (FSW). FSW {{is a relatively new}} welding process where a rotating non-consumable tool is used to join two materials through high temperature deformation. The aim of the thesis is the development of a numerical model to improve process understanding and to assist in the design of new tools. The early part of the thesis describes the process, defines the modelling problem and describes why a computational fluid dynamics package (FLUENT) was selected for the subsequent work. A systematic series of friction stir welding experiments in 7075 aluminium alloy, used to provide validation data for a numerical model of the process, are described in chapter 2. The trials examined how the welding conditions and tool type affected the weld temperature and heat input. From this data a thermal model of the welds was developed that included the convective heat flow due to material mixing. Chapters 3 to 6 describe the model development, from a preliminary model of a standard tool, to a detailed analysis of 2 dimensional profiles incorporating a novel slip boundary condition, and finally to a full 3 dimensional model of a new tool design, including material slip. The preliminary model with a standard tool assumed that the material stuck to the tool surface and included features such as the tool tilt, heat generation and heat flow. The model captured many of the real process characteristics, but gave poor predictions of the welding forces and heat generation. This identified the need for a more complex treatment of the tool-material interface that allowed material slip. The slip model was first implemented in a 2 dimensional study of flow around profiled tooling (chapter 4). This enabled a first order visualisation of the flow and the quantitative comparison of different 2 dimensional pin profiles. In chapter 5 an optimised 2 dimensional pin profile was determined by selecting the shape that minimised the traversing force. Two prototype tools based on this profile were manufactured: the plain 'Trivex™' and the threaded 'MX-Trivex™'. These were tested against a conventional 'MX-Triflute™' tool with the results showing that the traversing force was reduced by 18 - 25 %. Chapter 6 describes 3 dimensional models of the 'Trivex™' and 'Triflute™' tools, which extended the slip model to 3 dimensions. The model correctly predicted that the Trivex™ tool had <b>lower</b> <b>traversing</b> and down forces than its Triflute™ counterpart, as observed experimentally. The thesis successfully demonstrates the application of fluid dynamics modelling to friction stir welding, enhancing visualisation of the flow, and guiding the development of new tooling.

50|$|Platt is {{situated}} {{on one of}} the most active segments of the Diendorf fault, a geological disturbance <b>traversing</b> <b>Lower</b> Austria from Wieselburg and Melk to Mautern, Krems and Maissau, then continues northward towards the Czech border.

Occasionally large cavities collapse and take entire surface structures down with them, as happened with parts of a vineyard in 1942. This might be the reason for the unexplained disappearance of a building of local significance (sometimes referred to as a castle) which was independently documented by several sources in the early 17th century but was gone by the 1670s, apparently without leaving permanent traces. It has been suggested that the building became a victim of the Diendorf fault, but it is also possible that it was destroyed by invading Swedish troops during the final phase of the Thirty Years' War: in 1645, the headquarters for Swedish army operations in Lower Austria had been established in the immediate vicinity, at the castle of Schrattenthal.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mind is a}} {{biological}} phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at {{a lower level of}} organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each {{increase in the number of}} traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a <b>lower</b> number of <b>traverses.</b> The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses – neural plasticity and neural activity – are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e. g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind–body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies...|$|R

The process of contraction of Holocene river activity into a narrower channel belt than in LGM counterparts of the last cycle, links to terrace flight formation over multiple glacial cycles in inland reaches. Not only were valley reaches affected by the process: also the <b>lower</b> reaches <b>traversing</b> shelf areas were, at a critical time just before their transgression. It is important to get fluvial style change mapped and dated accurately, to contribute to Source- 2 -Sink style sediment budgeting studies {{and be able to}} quantify sediment routing over longer time scales ‘from the record’ rather than ‘from assumptions pasted in models’. In the Netherlands, in our current time, we are favoured by a very well resolved Late Pleistocene and Holocene geological record. This is due to favourable palaeogeographical circumstances and long research tradition from academia and applied fields. The sheer amount area mapped in detail, and sheer number of ‘to-be-integrated’ studies made it fruitful to set up and fill a GIS system for the reconstruction of valley evolution since the LGM (Cohen et al., 2012), expanding earlier such work for the Holocene Rhine delta (Berendsen et al., 2007). The reconstruction now covers the Valley evolution of the Rhine since the LGM, continuous in space and time from upstream reaches in the German Lower Rhine Embayment (Erkens et al., 2011), through the Dutch-German border area (e. g. Kasse et al., 2005; Janssens et al. 2012), the central delta (Busschers et al., 2007; Gouw & Erkens, 2007) to the present river mouth and beyond (Hijma et al. 2009; 2012). To produce the map, we filled a digital catalogue documenting each mapped element (paleomeanders, terrace-fragments) in the valley. Reconstruction of reworking as part of the valley evolution is an intrinsic part of the encoding in the GIS. The main finding in the Lower Rhine is that the studied transition appears to last longer and to be slower than in smaller rivers of NW Europe. From the LGM to after the transgression, the area was subsiding relatively fast owing to the near-field GIA circumstances on top of background tectonics. All the time the area was fed river water and sediment by the Rhine: a sizable mixed-load river system. During the period of interest, climatic amelioration made vegetation go through a distinct succession. Not only does this provide extra dating control beyond direct methods of 14 C and OSL, but also does this provide opportunities to reconstruct local and regional hydrological changes and relate this to the changes in fluvial style and reworking (scour, incision, levee deposition, lateral migration, floodplain soil formation). Extensive areal palaeogeographical reconstruction (GIS map and catalogue) shows the Lower Rhine's valley evolution from LGM to Holocene in unprecedented detai...|$|R
5000|$|The main — and {{traditional}} — {{entrance into the}} Smoke Hole is from the south through a water gap between Big Mountain and Cave Mountain about two {{miles north of the}} community of Upper Tract. (This is about 1.5 miles along Pendleton County Route 2 beyond the bridge where US Route 220 crosses the South Branch.) The name of this [...] "gateway" [...] to the Canyon is Cave Mountain Gap and it represents a half mile cut through the high ridge separating the ancient riverbed of the South Branch Potomac River (to the east) from the ancient bed of Briggs Run (to the west). [...] Eons ago — through a process known as [...] "river piracy" [...] or stream capture — the flow of the river was diverted cataclysmically from its old bed westward into what would eventually become the present Smoke Hole gorge through massive excavation and erosion. This likely developed through an intermediate stage during which the South Branch (or its precursor stream here, the <b>lower</b> Briggs Run) <b>traversed</b> the future Smoke Hole region underground. The roof of the vast subterranean channel then collapsed forming the karst topography seen today. Before the river exits the gap it passes through a narrow channel with ferocious rapids locally known as the [...] "Rock Break". Nearby is Big Spring, source of the water supply for Upper Tract, which discharges 1,040 gallons per minute. (The spring issues from the base of Cave Mountain and is situated about 1,000 feet directly downhill of Cave Mountain Cave (formerly, [...] "Big Cave"). Many explorers have tried to find connections between the dry cave — which has had over two miles of passages mapped as of 2001 — and the spring, but so far without success. It was here, at cave and spring, that Confederates operated a salt petre works during the Civil War.) High above the river, {{on the north side of}} the gap, is a prominent range of limestone cliffs which represent the Cave Mountain Anticline. Here also, at river level, is a very prominent crag — Eagle Rock. A bit further on, Cat Path Rocks, a perpendicular cliff, has been partially cut through by the roadbed and is followed by another outcropping known as High Rocks.|$|R
