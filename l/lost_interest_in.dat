5|$|A serialised {{novelisation}} of Quatermass II, {{written by}} Kneale, {{ran in the}} Daily Express newspaper in the UK from 5 December to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the project. The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, {{to coincide with the}} transmission of the Thames Television serial.|$|E
5|$|Election Special was {{released}} by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records on August 16, 2012, one week before the 2012 Republican National Convention. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly higher in other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing a <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect of releasing records.|$|E

5|$|Iles {{remained}} as superintendent until 1957, and {{proved to be}} a good publicist for the zoo, taking part in radio and television programmes such as Children's Hour. A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a Chimps' Tea Party, which proved to be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but by then the owners of Belle Vue had <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.|$|E
5|$|In December 1963 Byrne {{took over}} the control of Stramsact in the UK, and then set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelt backwards) in the United States. Epstein was able to renegotiate a more {{favourable}} commission of 49% in August 1964, but then became embroiled in a three-year court battle with Byrne regarding payment of monies due, during which time potential sponsors <b>lost</b> <b>interest.</b> <b>In</b> August 1967 Epstein died, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Jacobs was found hanged in his garage on 15 December 1968. Byrne later retired to the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|In an interview, Auerbach {{confessed that}} he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> big-time {{managing}} in the early 1990s, preferring {{to stay in the}} background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.|$|E

5|$|Alright, Still is {{the debut}} studio album by English singer and {{songwriter}} Lily Allen, released on 13 July 2006 by Regal Recordings. After being rejected by several labels, Allen signed to London Records, who eventually <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Allen, leading her to meet production duo Future Cut and sign to Regal Recordings. Recording for the album began in 2004 with sessions between Allen and Future Cut, and Allen's work garnered publicity on the Internet as she posted demos to her Myspace account {{before they were}} officially released. Allen later travelled to the United States to work with Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, to complete the final half of the album in 2006.|$|E
5|$|By September 1963, Waters and Mason had <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{their studies}} {{and moved into}} the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a {{part-time}} tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} Regent Street Polytechnic.|$|E

5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, and he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{many of his}} sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.|$|E
5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the rush. The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Gottlob Christian Berger (16 July 1896– 5 January 1975) was {{a senior}} German Nazi {{official}} who held the rank of SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general), and was {{the chief of the}} SS Main Office responsible for Schutzstaffel (SS) recruiting during World War II. Serving in the German Army during World War I, he was wounded four times and awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Immediately after the war, he was a leader of the Einwohnerwehr militia in his native North Württemberg. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922, but <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> right-wing politics during the 1920s, training and working as a physical education teacher.|$|E

50|$|In 1780, the {{relationship}} was temporarily broken because of Frederick Adolf's infatuation and marriage plans to Countess Margareta Lovisa Wrangel. Sophie Hagman was met with great sympathy at court because of the good impression she had made and because she was now without means to support herself, and Gustav III therefore promised her a pension. When the marriage negotiations with Wrangel failed and the Frederick Adolf <b>lost</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> her in 1781, he returned to Hagman and resumed {{the relationship}} with her. She was to have explained to him that {{she could no longer}} love him after he had hurt her, and after this, Frederick Adolf was never known to have been unfaithfull to her.|$|R

5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try {{a high-quality}} digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared in the}} summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both Amazing and Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the magazines.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|Patton's final {{assignment}} was {{to command the}} Fifteenth United States Army, based in Bad Nauheim. The Fifteenth Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile {{a history of the}} war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the duty. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun, as well as Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided he would leave his post at the Fifteenth Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} {{football}} at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) {{returned from his}} leave with a football. While throwing the ball with a friend, it was dropped {{and a group of}} fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball was kicked into the Severn River. However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack Clary. Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879.|$|E
