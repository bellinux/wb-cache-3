She describes her experience co-facilitating the SSSC seminar and working with college students engaged in service learning in order to foster a deeper spiritual understanding and motivate students toward social change in their communities through their service work. It was mid-way through a lively class discussion when Sally asked, “How do we separate our beliefs from stereotypes in working towards social justice? ” The students looked at me with their pens steady. Sally had been struggling with feeling unsafe on her morning walk through San Francisco’s Tenderloin district to her summer public service fellowship at Planned Parenthood for the past couple weeks. I tried to conjure up all the student development theories I learned in graduate school, but my mind was blank. Maybe Rev. McLennan would say something? But when I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he was also eagerly awaiting my response. Pens started tapping. After a few moments of silence in the classroom, I managed to squeak, “That’s a great question, Sally. Many of us experience a similar tension. Would anyone like to comment? ” Pens dropped. Someone yawned. ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{had moved}} on, at his turning {{to walk with}} her, {{so as not to}} keep her {{standing}} in the snow, and now she said, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "I've decided that it won't do to let the ghost have all the glory. I don't think it will be fair to let the people merely be scared, even when they've been warned that they're to see a ghost and told it isn't real." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't come in," [...] said Alvina to Geoffrey, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as she entered. Then {{she closed the}} door behind her, and stood with her back to it, facing the Italian. He sat loose on the bed, a cigarette between his fingers, dropping ash on the bare boards between his feet. He looked up curiously at Alvina. She stood watching him with wide, bright blue eyes, smiling slightly, and saying nothing. He looked up at her steadily, on his guard, from under his long black lashes.|$|R
60|$|He was {{surprised}} to find it open. He entered, and quietly closed it behind him. Then he went down the step past the bar-counter, and through to the lighted doorway of the kitchen. There sat his wife, planted in front of the range, where a furze fire was burning. She sat in a chair full in front of the range, her knees wide apart on the fender. She <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as he entered, but she did not speak. Then she stared in the fire again.|$|R
60|$|He {{was subject}} to {{gigantic}} fantasies still. In spite of himself, {{the sight of the}} new moon, as representing one who, by her so-called inconstancy, acted up to his own idea of a migratory Well-Beloved, made him feel as if his wraith in a changed sex had suddenly <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the horizon <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In a crowd secretly, or in solitude boldly, he had often bowed the knee three times to this sisterly divinity on her first appearance monthly, and directed a kiss towards her shining shape. The curse of his qualities (if it were not a blessing) was far from having spent itself yet.|$|R
6000|$|The Knight put spurs to his horse, {{and dashed}} away {{over the hills}} without ever looking back, and the Princess stood <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> the gate <b>at</b> <b>him</b> till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill. The Knight was gone. Many suitors flocked about the Princess. Mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and {{attended}} her every journey. They came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again, {{but none of them}} found favor in her eyes. [...] "Will the Princess listen to no one?" [...] they began to say among themselves. [...] "Has she given her heart to some one who is not among us?" [...] No one could say.|$|R
60|$|On {{she went}} under the boughs, now in light, now in shade, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> every few moments and kissing her hand; but so cunningly dodging about {{among the trees}} and moon-shades that she never allowed him to get dangerously near her. Thus they ran and doubled, Fitzpiers warming with the chase, till {{the sound of their}} companions had quite died away. He began to lose hope of ever overtaking her, when all at once, by way of encouragement, she turned to a fence in which there was a stile and leaped over it. Outside the scene was a changed one--a meadow, where the half-made hay lay about in heaps, in the uninterrupted shine of the now high moon.|$|R

Mr. Secretary desired I {{would see}} him this morning; said he had several things to say to me, and said not one; and the Duke of Ormond sent to desire I would meet <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Southwell's by ten this morning too, which I did, {{thinking}} it was some particular matter. All the Irish in town were there, to consult upon preventing a Bill for laying a duty on Irish yarn; so we talked a while, and then all went to {{the lobby of the}} House of Commons, to solicit our friends, and the Duke came among the rest; and Lord Anglesea solicited admirably, and I did wonders. But, after all, the matter was put off till Monday, and then we are to be at it again. I dined with Lord Mountjoy, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> chess, which put me in mind of Stella and Griffyth.(2) I came home, and that dog Patrick was not within; so I fretted, and fretted, and what good did that do me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid! Oh! it was {{ten times}} more than splendid. It was as though the god Osiris were once more wed to the goddess Isis in the very halls of heaven. Indeed his Highness, the bridegroom, was dressed as a god, yes, he wore the robes and the holy {{ornaments}} of Amon. And the procession! And the feast that Pharaoh gave! I {{tell you that the}} Prince was so overcome with joy and all this weight of glory that, before it was <b>over,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> I saw that his eyes were closed, being dazzled by the gleam of gold and jewels and the loveliness of his royal bride. He {{told me that it was}} so himself, fearing perhaps lest I should have thought that he was asleep. Then there were the presents, something to everyone of us according to his degree. I got--well it matters not. And, learned Ana, I did not forget you. Knowing well that everything would be gone before you returned I spoke your name in the ear of his Highness, offering to keep your gift." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the same}} scene and the same figures, but the drama had {{advanced}} a stage. The tall young man was holding the woman in his arms. She strained {{away from him and}} looked up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with loathing in her face. They had torn the crouching man away from his hold upon the skirt of her dress. A dozen of them were round him--savage men, bearded men. They hacked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with knives. All seemed to strike him together. Their arms rose and fell. The blood did not flow from him--it squirted. His red dress was dabbled in it. He threw himself this way and that, purple upon crimson, like an over-ripe plum. Still they hacked, and still the jets shot from him. It was horrible--horrible! They dragged him kicking to the door. The woman <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and her mouth gaped. I heard nothing, but I knew that she was screaming. And then, whether it was this nerve-racking vision before me, or whether, my task finished, all the overwork of the past weeks came in one crushing weight upon me, the room danced round me, the floor seemed to sink away beneath my feet, and I remembered no more. In the early morning my landlady found me stretched senseless before the silver mirror, but I knew nothing myself until three days ago I awoke in the deep peace of the doctor's nursing home.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{they reached}} Moscow Benham was already {{becoming}} accustomed to disregard Prothero. He was <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the vast heaving trouble of Russia, which now {{was like a}} sea that tumbles under the hurrying darknesses of an approaching storm. In those days {{it looked as though}} it must be an overwhelming storm. He was drinking in the wide and massive Russian effects, the drifting crowds in the entangling streets, the houses with their strange lettering in black and gold, the innumerable barbaric churches, the wildly driven droshkys, the sombre red fortress of the Kremlin, with its bulbous churches clustering up into the sky, the crosses, the innumerable gold crosses, the mad church of St. Basil, carrying the Russian note beyond the pitch of permissible caricature, and in this setting the obscure drama of clustering, staring, sash-wearing peasants, long-haired students, sane-eyed women, a thousand varieties of uniform, a running and galloping to and fro of messengers, a flutter of little papers, whispers, shouts, shots, a drama elusive and portentous, a gathering of forces, an accumulation of tension going on to a perpetual clash and clamour of bells. Benham had brought letters of introduction to a variety of people, some had vanished, it seemed. They were [...] "away," [...] the porters said, and they continued to be [...] "away,"--it was the formula, he learnt, for arrest; others were evasive, a few showed themselves extraordinarily anxious to inform him about things, to explain themselves and things about them exhaustively. One young student took him to various meetings and showed him in great detail the scene of the recent murder of the Grand Duke Sergius. The buildings opposite the old French cannons were still under repair. [...] "The assassin stood just here. The bomb fell there, look! right down there towards the gate; that was where they found his arm. He was torn to fragments. He was scraped up. He was mixed with the horses...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember it!" [...] I answered, {{holding my}} brow {{with my hands}} to keep the flood of thought from {{bursting}} it to fragments. [...] "Remember it! Why, {{it comes back to}} me like waves of fire and burns me. I remember every word, every act, every gesture. I lifted my head slowly, Jack, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the screen <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In the twilight, I saw him there--the man I called my father--holding the bottle to your face, that wicked bottle of chloroform, with his revolver in one hand, and a calm smile like a fiend's playing hatefully and cruelly round that grave-looking mouth of his. I never saw any man look so ghastly in my life. I was rooted to the spot with awe and terror. I dared hardly cry out or move. Yet I knew this was murder. He would kill you! He would kill you! He was trying to poison you before my very eyes. Oh, heaven, how I hated him! He was no father of mine. He had never been my father. And he was murdering the man I loved best in the world. For I loved you better than life, Jack! Oh, the strain of it was terrible! I see it all now. I live it all over again. With one wild bound I leapt forward, and, hardly knowing what I did, I pressed the button, turned off the current from the battery, and rushed wildly upon him. I suppose the knob I pressed not only released you, but set the photographic machine at work automatically. But I didn't know it then. At any rate, I remember now, in the seconds that followed, flash came fast after flash. There was a sudden illumination. The room was lighter than day. It grew alternately bright as noon and then dark as pitch again by contrast. And {{by the light of the}} flashes, I saw you, half-dazed with the chloroform, standing helpless there.|$|R

'At {{last the}} tide flowed, {{silencing}} the plaint and {{the cries of}} pain, and the dawn was near when Brown, sitting with his chin {{in the palm of}} his hand before Patusan, as one might stare at the unscalable side of a mountain, heard the brief ringing bark of a brass 6-pounder far away in town somewhere. [...] "What's this?" [...] he asked of Cornelius, who hung about him. Cornelius listened. A muffled roaring shout rolled down-river over the town; a big drum began to throb, and others responded, pulsating and droning. Tiny scattered lights began to twinkle in the dark half of the town, while the part lighted by the loom of fires hummed with a deep and prolonged murmur. [...] "He has come," [...] said Cornelius. [...] "What? Already? Are you sure?" [...] Brown asked. [...] "Yes! yes! Sure. Listen to the noise." [...] "What are they making that row about?" [...] pursued Brown. [...] "For joy," [...] snorted Cornelius; [...] "he is a very great man, but all the same, he knows no more than a child, and so they make a great noise to please him, because they know no better." [...] "Look here," [...] said Brown, [...] "how is one to get at him?" [...] "He shall come to talk to you," [...] Cornelius declared. [...] "What do you mean? Come down here strolling as it were?" [...] Cornelius nodded vigorously in the dark. [...] "Yes. He will come straight here and talk to you. He is just like a fool. You shall see what a fool he is." [...] Brown was incredulous. [...] "You shall see; you shall see," [...] repeated Cornelius. [...] "He is not afraid--not afraid of anything. He will come and order you to leave his people alone. Everybody must leave his people alone. He is like a little child. He will come to you straight." [...] Alas! he knew Jim well--that [...] "mean little skunk," [...] as Brown called him to me. [...] "Yes, certainly," [...] he pursued with ardour, [...] "and then, captain, you tell that tall man with a gun to shoot him. Just you kill him, and you will frighten everybody so much that you can do anything you like with them afterwards--get what you like--go away when you like. Ha! ha! ha! Fine [...] ." [...] He almost danced with impatience and eagerness; and Brown, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> could see, shown up by the pitiless dawn, his men drenched with dew, sitting amongst the cold ashes and the litter of the camp, haggard, cowed, and in rags.' ...|$|R
