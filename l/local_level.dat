The prefect is not allowed {{to be a member of}} a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the <b>local</b> <b>level,</b> acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the <b>local</b> <b>level.</b> Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.|$|E

40|$|Instead of {{defining}} {{goodness of fit}} (GOF) tests {{in terms of their}} test statistics, we present an alternative method by introducing the concept of <b>local</b> <b>levels,</b> which indicate high or low local sensitivity of a test. <b>Local</b> <b>levels</b> can act {{as a starting point for}} the construction of new GOF tests. We study the behavior of <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> when applied to some well-known GOF tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, higher criticism (HC) tests and tests based on phi-divergences. The main focus is on a rigorous characterization of the asymptotic behavior of <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of the original HC tests which leads to several further asymptotic results for <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of other GOF tests including GOF tests with equal <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b> While <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of KS tests, which are related to the central range, are asymptotically strictly larger than zero, all <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of HC tests converge to zero as the sample size increases. Consequently, there exists no asymptotic level α GOF test such that all <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> are asymptotically bounded away from zero. Finally, by means of numerical computations we compare classical KS and HC tests to a GOF test with equal <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b> Comment: Published at [URL] in the Bernoulli ([URL] by the International Statistical Institute/Bernoulli Society ([URL]...|$|R

5|$|Virginia {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%, while the tax rate on food is 1.5%. There is an additional 1% local tax, {{for a total of}} a 5.3% combined sales tax on most Virginia purchases and 2.5% on most food. Virginia's property tax is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth.

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the <b>local</b> <b>level,</b> typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
