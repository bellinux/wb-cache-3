40|$|Abstract Background Many {{different}} {{variables are}} important to consider when creating resistancetraining programs. However the <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> that exercises are performed with has not beenstudied as extensively {{as many of the}} other factors. Some research has indicated that trainingwith specific <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> results in improved strength or hypertrophy adaptations comparedto other lifting tempos, but {{more research is needed to}} reach better knowledge on what liftingspeeds are optimal for specific goals. Aim The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of various <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> on differentfactors known to influence resistance training. The measured variables were muscle activity,maximum amount of repetitions performed and time under tension during bench press. Method Thirteen males performed bench press at their individual 6 RM. The exercise wasperformed to fatigue with three different lifting tempos (4 second repetitions, 6 secondrepetitions and repetitions intentionally performed as fast as possible). Number of repetitions performed and total time under tension for each test was recorded in seconds. Surfaceelectromyography (EMG) was used to register muscle activity of pectoralis major anddeltoideus anterior. Reference values were gathered using MVIC (Maximum voluntaryisometric contraction) tests. Results EMG amplitudes were higher in pectoralis major when a fast <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> (60. 1 ± 7. 3 % of MVIC) was used compared to the medium (54. 8 ± 10. 2) and slow (54. 3 ± 7. 1) conditions. More repetition were performed with faster <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds.</b> The time under tensionwas longer for the slow and medium lifting tempos than for the fast lifting tempo. Conclusion The result from this study can be considered when designing resistance trainingprograms. Based on the increased performance and muscle activity associated with the fastlifting tempo, faster <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> may be beneficial when the training goal is to increasestrength levels. It is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the optimal lifting tempo forspecific training designed to increase hypertrophy, but the time under tension appears to belonger for slower <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the influence of <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> and type on peak and cumulative back compressive force (BCF) and shoulder moment (SM) loads during symmetric lifting. Another aim {{of the study was to}} compare static and dynamic lifting models. Methods: Ten male participants performed a floor-to-shoulder, floor-to-waist, and waist-to-shoulder lift at three different speeds [slow (0. 34  m/s), medium (0. 44  m/s), and fast (0. 64  m/s) ], and with two different loads [light (2. 25  kg) and heavy (9  kg) ]. Two-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were determined. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to calculate peak and cumulative loading of BCF and SM for light and heavy loads. Results: Peak BCF was significantly different between slow and fast <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> (p <  0. 001), with a mean difference of 20 % between fast and slow lifts. The cumulative loading of BCF and SM was significantly different between fast and slow <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> (p <  0. 001), with mean differences ≥ 80 %. Conclusion: Based on peak values, BCF is highest for fast speeds, but the BCF cumulative loading is highest for slow speeds, with the largest difference between fast and slow lifts. This may imply that a slow <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> is at least as hazardous as a fast <b>lifting</b> <b>speed.</b> It is important to consider the duration of lift when determining risks for back and shoulder injuries due to lifting and that peak values alone are likely not sufficient...|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric lifting is {{associated}} with an increased risk of low back disorders. Especially in lifting movements, characterized by a small amount of asymmetry, it is still the question if asymmetric lumbosacral torques occur, or if subjects try to avoid asymmetric back loading by twisting their pelvis with respect to the feet. An increase of the <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> or the box weight might amplify the lumbar torques but might also result in an attempt to limit further increase of asymmetric torques by increasing pelvic twist. In the current study, asymmetrical lifting movements were analyzed {{with the aid of a}} 3 D linked segment model, using cuffs mounted to the body segments. Eight subjects performed lifting movements with five different asymmetry conditions, ranging from 0 to 90 °lifting asymmetry with respect to the sagittal plane, using two <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> and two box weights. A significant increase in lateral flexing and twisting low back torque was found for each increase in asymmetry of the lifting movement. Pelvic twist accounted more or less constantly for about 25 % of the lifting asymmetry and was hardly influenced by <b>lifting</b> <b>speed</b> or box weight. Even for 10 or 30 °of lifting asymmetry, subjects did not twist their pelvis far enough to avoid asymmetric loading of the low back. Assuming that asymmetric loading of the low back is more strenuous to the spine than symmetric loading, the current results indicate that even small deviations of a lifting movement from the sagittal plane can explain an increased risk of low back disorders...|$|R

In the case of buildings with two floor sizes, the optimal number of floors of each size and the ratio of the two floor areas are also found.

This alleviates the need to obtain interdepartment-trip volumes and department areas. New simple distance theorems form the basis of the formulae.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008. Certain non-Newtonian fluids {{exhibit a}} yield stress {{which can be}} {{measured}} {{with a variety of}} instruments varying from very sophisticated rotary and tube viscometers to hand-held slump cones and cylinders of various sizes. Accurate yield stress measurement is significant for process design and disposal operations for thickenend tailings. The slump value was first related to the yield stress by Murata (1984). Later, that work was corrected by Christensen (1991) for an error in the mathematical analysis. Slump, based on a circular cylindrical geometry was first investigated by Chandler (1986). These concepts led to the study by Pashias et al., (1996) that formed the basis for the current research. The Flow Process Research Centre (FPRC) at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology developed a slump meter designed to lift the cone or cylinder vertically at controlled lifting speeds. In addition the simple hand-held cylinder which is an adaptation of slump cones which were originally developed by the concrete industry to determine the flowability of fresh concrete was also used. The vane technique was used as a control. Cones and cylinders made of stainless steel and PVC were fitted to the slump meter. The yield stresses of four non-Newtonian fluids at different concentrations were tested in four different configurations at different lift speeds to ascertain whether the measuring position, <b>lift</b> <b>speed,</b> slip, geometry, wall surface material, and stability has an effect on the value of yield stress measured. The effect of different predictive models was also ascertained. The cylinder, lump and cone models relating slump to yield stress was used in the dimensional analysis of the results. The objective of this work was to determine if the slump tests (cone, cylinder and the hand-held cylinder) would generate yield stress values comparable to those found using the vane technique. It was establised that there was no significant effect of <b>lift</b> <b>speed,</b> stability, geometry and wall surface material on the value of yield stress. The effect of measuring position on the value of yield stress calculated gave a difference of 25 %. Using dimensional analysis, the lump model (Hallbom, 2005) more accurately predicts the material yield stress when using the hand-held cylinder as well as all the cone results (due to its specific geometry), and cylinder configurations, thus affirming the work of Clayton et al., 2003. It is concluded that, although the materials and concentrations tested induced errors within 40 %, the hand-held cylinder shows promise as a reliable, quick and simple way of measuring the yield stress...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} predicting static and dynamic peak back-compressive forces based on (1) static back compressive force values at the lift origin and destination and (2) <b>lifting</b> <b>speed.</b> Methods: Ten male subjects performed symmetric midsagittal floortoshoulder, floortowaist, and waisttoshoulder lifts at three different speeds (slow, medium, and fast), and with two different loads (light and heavy). Two-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were captured. Linear regression analyses were used to develop prediction equations, the amount of predictability, and significance for static and dynamic peak backcompressive forces based on a static origin and destination average (SODA) back compressive force. Results: Static and dynamic peak back-compressive forces were highly predicted by the SODA, with R 2 values ranging from 0. 830 to 0. 947. Slopes were significantly different between slow and fast <b>lifting</b> <b>speeds</b> (p < 0. 05) for the dynamic peak prediction equa-tions. The slope of the regression line for static prediction was significantly greater than one with a significant positive intercept value. Conclusion: SODA under-predict both static and dynamic peak back-compressive force values. Peak values are highly predictable and could be readily determined using back-compressive force assessments at the origin and destination of a lifting task.

The wheel loader is modeled as a system with five states and three control inputs including torque converter nonlinearities.

The geometry of the wheel loader boom and the demanded force in the lift cylinders during lifting are used {{to ensure that the}} in-cylinder pressure remains below component’s limits. The lift-transport section of the short loading cycle is divided into four phases due to discontinuities in the gearbox ratios and fuel consumption is calculated in each phase.

The surface morphology of GO sheets transferred under different subphase and transfer conditions has been studied. RCA- 1 (NH 4 OH:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O - 1 : 1 : 2) treatment of Si is found to be necessary for the transfer of GO sheets. The deposition on RCA- 1 treated Si, is also highly sensitive to the compressibility of the Langmuir monolayer. Thus, transfer of well defined, uniformly distributed and flat GO sheets on Si is possible only in a narrow window of process parameters, namely, subphase pH, target pressure and <b>lifting</b> <b>speed.</b> In contrast, the transfer behavior and morphology of GO sheets on RCA- 1 treated SiO 2 /Si is practically insensitive to changes in subphase pH, target pressure and <b>lifting</b> <b>speed.</b> This behavior is attributed to the uniformly strong hydrophilic character of SiO 2 /Si surface, compared to that of Si.

Eight physically active participants performed sets of Squat Jumps, Countermovement Jumps, Squats and Bench Presses at a maximal <b>lifting</b> <b>speed.</b> A linear encoder was used to measure the instantaneous speed at a 200 Hz sampling rate. Subsequently, the power spectrum of the signal was computed by evaluating its Discrete Fourier Transform. The sampling frequency needed to reconstruct the signals with an error of less than 0. 1 % was f 99. 9 = 11. 615 ± 2. 680 Hz for the exercise exhibiting the largest bandwidth, with the absolute highest individual value being 17. 467 Hz. There was no difference between sets in any of the exercises. Using the closest integer sampling frequency value (25 Hz) yielded a reconstruction of the signal up to 99. 975 ± 0. 025 % of its total in the worst case. In conclusion, a sampling rate of 25 Hz or above is more than adequate to record raw speed data and compute power during resistance training exercises, even under the most extreme circumstances during explosive exercises.
