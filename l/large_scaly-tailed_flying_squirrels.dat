50|$|The flying mice, {{also known}} as the pygmy scaly-tails, pygmy <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> or pygmy anomalures are not mice, not squirrels, and are not capable of true flight. These unusual rodents are {{essentially}} miniaturized versions of anomalures and are part of the same sub-Saharan African radiation of gliding mammal.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Idiurus zenkeri) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Anomaluridae. It is found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Uganda. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The long-eared flying mouse (Idiurus macrotis), or long-eared <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> is {{a species}} of flying mouse from western and central Africa. It is not {{actually}} a :squirrel, nor a :mouse, {{though it is a}} rodent. Not much is known about them because they are very hard to keep alive in captivity.|$|R
25|$|Anomalures or <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> (family Anomaluridae) (gliding). These brightly {{coloured}} African rodents are not squirrels {{but have}} evolved to a resemble <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> by convergent evolution. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus Idiurus contains two particularly small species known as flying mice, but similarly they are not true mice.|$|R
50|$|Kabirmys qarunensis is an {{extinct species}} of anomaluroid (<b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel)</b> rodent from the {{earliest}} late Eocene of the Birket Qarun Formation from northern Egypt. So far, it was monotypic in its genus. It was described in September 2010 by Hesham Sallam, Erik Seiffert, Elwyn Simons, and Chlöe Brindley based on isolated teeth, partial mandibles, and an edentulous partial maxilla. It is noteworthy for being the largest known Eocene anomaluroid.|$|R
25|$|Three hundred {{species of}} mammals have been {{reported}} in Tanzania. Some of the species reported are: African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), Burchell's zebra (Equus burchellii), Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus), kipunji (Rungwecebus kipunji), Thomas's bushbaby (Galago thomasi), Prince Demidoff's bushbaby (Galagoides demidovii), puku (Kobus vardonii), gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), pygmy <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Idiurus zenkeri), suni (Neotragus moschatus), mbarapi (Hippotragus niger) and North African crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata).|$|R
50|$|Lord Derby's scaly-tailed {{squirrel}} is nocturnal, {{and will}} sleep in nests in holes in trees. They live either {{alone or in}} pairs. They move around by extending their membrane and gliding from tree to tree. Flights of up to 250 meters (820 feet) have been recorded. They will use the scales {{on the bottom of}} their tails to help themselves climb in the trees. Lord Derby's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are mainly herbivorous, eating plant matter such as leaves, bark, green nuts, fruit and flowers.|$|R
50|$|Gliding {{has evolved}} {{independently}} {{in a variety}} of arboreal animals. Among mammals, there are the marsupial gliding possums of Australia, the colugos of SE Asia, and the <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> of Africa. Each group glides in a slightly different way, with their patagia being controlled by different morphological adaptations. In some marsupial gliders for example, the patagium attaches at the elbows, whereas in colugos it extends into webbed digits. The fact that all <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are “wrist gliders” with shared wrist anatomy suggests that they are all descended from a common ancestor, presumably some sort of primitive tree squirrel. Non-mammalian arboreal gliders include frogs, geckos, snakes, lizards, and even ants.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> {{with adults}} having a head-and-body length of 185 to 255 mm with a tail length of 120 to 200 mm. This <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> weighs between 170 and 300 g. The head is grey, {{and there is no}} {{contrasting}} colour on the edges of the ears. The fur on the upper parts is very variable in colour, ranging from black, grizzled grey or olive brown to mottled tan. The upper side of the membranes are dark grey, with the membranes near the tail tinged with yellow. The underparts are creamy white or yellowish, without any hint of rufous. The tufts of bristles surrounding the hind claws are also white. As with other <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> in the genus Anomalurus, a membrane is attached between the thighs and the more basal part of the tail. This part of the tail bears a patch of large cornified scales on the underside, the rest of the tail being plume-like.|$|R
5000|$|To achieve gliding flight, it uses two {{membranes}} (patagia) which fold up {{when not}} in use. When the limbs are stretched wide in a star-shape, the membranes become taut and allow the rodent to glide from tree to tree. Being arboreal, Idiurus spends all of its time in the trees, living in hollow trunks in groups of 2 to 40. Limit information {{suggests that it is}} mainly frugivorous. [...] It has a long tail in proportion to its body, sporting two lines of raised scales, and patches of scaly skin to help it grip trees, but the rest of its body is furry. The tail is longer than the body and is also used to balance, like a primate's tail. Long-eared <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are about 20 cm long and weigh 30g. In comparison, the body of a common household mouse is approximately 10 cm long and its tail is approximately 5 cm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{relationships}} between Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates {{and their allies}} (Euarchontoglires) have long been debated. While it is now generally agreed that Rodentia constitutes a monophyletic sister-group of Lagomorpha and that this clade (Glires) is sister to Primates and Dermoptera, higher-level relationships within Rodentia remain contentious. Results We have sequenced and performed extensive evolutionary analyses on the mitochondrial genome of the <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> Anomalurus sp., an enigmatic rodent whose phylogenetic affinities have been obscure and extensively debated. Our phylogenetic analyses of the coding regions of available complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Euarchontoglires suggest that Anomalurus is a sister taxon to the Hystricognathi, and that this clade represents the most basal divergence among sampled Rodentia. Bayesian dating methods incorporating a relaxed molecular clock provide divergence-time estimates which are consistently {{in agreement with the}} fossil record and which indicate a rapid radiation within Glires around 60 million years ago. Conclusion Taken together, the data presented provide a working hypothesis as to the phylogenetic placement of Anomalurus, underline the utility of mitochondrial sequences in the resolution of even relatively deep divergences and go some way to explaining the difficulty of conclusively resolving higher-level relationships within Glires with available data and methodologies. </p...|$|R
5|$|<b>Scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrels</b> and <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> {{although}} not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|R

5000|$|The {{three species}} of New World <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> genus Glaucomys, {{are the only}} species of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> found in North America. [...] They are {{distributed}} from Alaska to Honduras. They are similar in many ways to the Eurasian <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> in the genus Pteromys. Two species of New World <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> can be easily distinguished {{on the basis of}} size and ventral pelage. Northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> Glaucomys sabrinus are larger and have belly hair that is dark at the base and white at the tip. Southern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> Glaucomys volans, are smaller and have belly hairs that are completely white. Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> is more difficult to distinguish from the northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> where their ranges overlap. In fact, they were considered conspecific. The Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> is considered a cryptic species. They are generally smaller and darker than northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels.</b>|$|R

50|$|Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Glaucomys oregonensis) is one {{of three}} species of the genus Glaucomys, the only <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> found in North America. Using genetic analyses, Arbogast et al. (2017) showed that Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> {{previously}} thought to be conspecific with the northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> was actually a distinct species. Humboldt's <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests from southern British Columbia to southern California. They are similar in appearance to the northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> however, they are generally smaller and have darker pelage. They are good gliders but clumsy walkers on the ground. They feed on a variety of plant material as well as tree sap, fungi, insects, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings. They mostly breed once a year in a cavity lined with lichen or other soft material. Unlike most members of their family, <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are strictly nocturnal.|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the distribution and}} relative abundance of giant <b>squirrels</b> and <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{in the state of}} Karnataka, India. Two species of giant squirrels, the Indian giant squirrel and the grizzled giant squirrel, and two species of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> the large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> and the small Travancore <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> were found to occur in Karnataka. Indian giant squirrels and large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> were more widely distributed than the other two species. The distributional range included the forests of the Western and Eastern Ghats. However, their distribution was confined only to forests with tall trees. Indian giant squirrels and large brown <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> occur in both deciduous and evergreen forests. Small Travancore <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> occupied high-rainfall evergreen forests on western slopes in the Western Ghats, and the grizzled giant squirrels occupy riverine forests. This report of the small Travancore <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> is the first of this species from Karnataka, and this population is the most northern population of its distributional range. Hunting was found to be a major threat, and influenced the abundance of all species except the grizzled giant squirrel. Hunting was primarily for domestic consumption...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{reports of}} {{ultrasound}} use by <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> have existed for decades, yet {{there has been}} little detailed analysis of their vocalizations. Here we demonstrate that two species of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> emit ultrasonic vocalizations. We recorded vocalizations from northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern (G. volans) <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> calling in both the laboratory and at a field site in central Ontario, Canada. We demonstrate that <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> produce ultrasonic emissions through recorded bursts of broadband noise and time-frequency structured frequency modulated (FM) vocalizations, some of which were purely ultrasonic. Squirrels emitted three types of ultrasonic calls in laboratory recordings and one type in the field. The variety of signals that were recorded suggest that <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> may use ultrasonic vocalizations to transfer information. Thus, vocalizations may be an important, although still poorly understood, aspect of <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> social biology...|$|R
