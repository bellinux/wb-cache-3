40|$|This report {{deals with}} the <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> used for {{development}} studies on the sub-transmission grid. The aims of grid development studies are firstly to locate the needs for grid reinforcement, then to elaborate a reinforcement strategy and finally to promote the profitability of this reinforcement. This study is about the last step of grid development studies: benefits calculation. The profitability of grid development studies is estimated by comparing grid investment costs and failure costs modelled by the energy not supplied. <b>Load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> are {{used to calculate the}} energy not supplied due to transmission limitations and therefore to promote the profitability of grid developments (new transmission facilities…). Current <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> come from a catalogue created in the early nineties which identifies nine consumption profiles. The aim {{of this study was to}} decide whether this catalogue is still valid or not, and, if this catalogue is no longer valid, to elaborate a new catalogue or a homemade software to create on demand, i. e. “à la carte”, <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> or <b>load</b> curves for every studied area. Firstly, current catalogue relevance has been analyzed through comparisons with real measured <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> of fourteen areas which showed its inadequacy. Then, the study of the real measured <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> proved that an accurate catalogue including all the existing load profiles would require a huge number of parameters to describe it. Therefore, a new simple catalogue could be enough to model load profiles on large areas for large scale studies but not for local studies. For these last ones, on demand <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> would be preferred to have an appropriate detailed and realistic description of local load behaviour. Finally, a simple method and software to create <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> or <b>load</b> curves for every studied area has been developed. Through this analysis, questions were raised of which some could not be answered and this method is not applicable right now.

In the decomposition, the bottom-up (energy) submodel of MERGE is embedded in a quadratically constrained program (QCP) that maximizes a welfare function calibrated on a linear approximation, around a benchmark point, of aggregated energy and capital demand. This latter is provided by constraining energy supply in a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) that essentially contains the MERGE top-down (macro) submodel.

40|$|Abstract—In {{power system}} studies, {{seasonal}} <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curve</b> (LDC) {{plays an important}} role in medium term horizon power system planning, reliability and energy markets studies, and economic analysis of electric power systems. Therefore, finding a simple and accurate model to forecast LDC is beneficial to network operators as well as market participants. This paper proposes a new framework to forecast seasonal LDC. As there are few contributions regarding forecasting curve time series, we redefine the problem of forecasting LDCs into a vector forecasting problem. In fact, we divide LDCs into three parts, and then, artificial neural network (ANN) engines are used to forecast future values of the three parts. The load data of Alberta electricity market from 2000 to 2013 is used to verify validity of the proposed method.

Based on {{the works in}} [5, 6], the DC power flow model are used to obtain more accurate maximum arrival power for more accurate reliability indices.

Usually, the FDC is constructed empirically for a given set of flow data, and the FDC so constructed is found to vary from one year to another and from one gauging station to another within the same watershed. This article attempts to analytically derive the FDC by maximizing the Tsallis entropy based on the knowledge that the mean discharge is known, thus obviating the need for any fitting. The mean discharge is found to be strongly related to the drainage area. The Tsallis entropy-based FDC is tested using field data and is found to be in agreement with the observed curve. The entropy method permits a probabilistic characterization of the FDC and hence a quantitative assessment of its uncertainty. With this method, the flow <b>duration</b> <b>curve</b> can also be forecasted for different recurrence intervals. The entropy is found to monotonically increase with the increase in time interval, indicating that the flow system becomes more complex but the degree of complexity decreases with increasing time interval after a certain time, eventually reaching a constant value, reflecting a reduced influence of land use change and other human influences on the flow regime...|$|R

The French current electricity mix is characterised by a high share of nuclear power which equalled 73 % of the total electric production in 2013.

However, the production cost increase could be compensated by implementing a progressive replacement of the plants. Besides, incentives proves required for nuclear to compete with combined cycle gas turbines as its alternative backup option. In order to make the social planner and plant operator goals coincide, the solution could be to find new outlets rather than reducing nuclear load factors.

40|$|Abstract. The {{estimated}} {{growth of}} Europe’s electricity demand {{and the policy}} goals of mitigating climate change result in an expected increase in variable renewable energy. A high penetration of wind and solar energy will bring several new challenges to the European electricity transmission network. The objective {{of this paper is}} to understand the effects of a high penetration of variable renewable energy sources (RES) on the demand for cross-border electricity transmission in Europe. EUPowerDispatch, a minimum cost dispatch model is used to compare the impacts of different electricity generation and transmission portfolios on cross-border electricity transmission in 2025. The analysis makes use of the best-estimate scenario developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). Wind and solar energy curtailment needs and variations in <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> <b>curves</b> are analyzed for different scenarios. In addition, the role of hydro energy storage and pumping is analyzed as a complementary technology to transmission in the context of a high penetration of variable RES. The study shows that the planned expansion of the European transmission network is adequate for meeting the expected RES increase and it is needed to maintain the current level of security of supply in the face of the expected demand growth. If RES growth is faster than expected, cross-border transmission capacity will have to increase accordingly if significant RES curtailment is to be avoided...|$|R
