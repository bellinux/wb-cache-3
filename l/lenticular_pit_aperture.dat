40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] air-seeding hypothesis predicts that xylem embolism resistance is linked directly to bordered pit functioning. We tested this prediction in trunks, roots, and branches at different vertical and radial locations in young and old trees of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Dimensions of bordered pits were measured from light and scanning electron micrographs, and physiological data were from published values. Consistent with observations, calculations showed that earlywood tracheids were more resistant to embolism than latewood tracheids, mainly from earlywood having stretchier pit membranes that can distend and cover the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture.</b> Air seeding that occurs in earlywood appears to happen through gaps between the torus edge and pit border, {{as shown by the}} similar calculated pressures required to stretch the membrane over the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> and to cause embolism. Although bordered pit functioning was correlated with tracheid hydraulic diameter, pit pore size and above all <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> constrained conductivity the most. From roots to branches and from the trunk base to higher on the trunk, hydraulic resistance of the earlywood pit membrane increased significantly because of a decrease {{in the size of the}} <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> and size and number of margo pores. Moreover, overall wood conductivity decreased, in part due to lower pit conductivity and a decrease in size and frequency of pits. Structural and functional constraints leading to the trade-off of efficiency against safety of water transport were also demonstrated at the individual pit level, with a positive correlation between pit membrane resistance on an area basis and the pressure differential required to cause membrane stretching, a characteristic that is essential for pit aspiration...|$|R
40|$|Resistance to water-stress induced {{cavitation}} is {{an important}} indicator of drought tolerance in woody species and {{is known to be}} intimately linked to the anatomy of the xylem. However, the actual mechanical properties of the pit membrane are not well known and the exact mode of air-seeding by which cavitation occurs is still uncertain. We examined the relationship between cavitation resistance and bordered pit structure and function in 40 coniferous species. Xylem pressure inducing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductance (P 50, a proxy for cavitation resistance) varied widely among species, from − 2. 9 to − 11. 3 MPa. The valve effect of the pit membrane, measured as a function of margo flexibility and torus overlap, explained more variation in cavitation-resistance than simple anatomical traits such as <b>pit</b> membrane, <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> or torus size. Highly cavitation resistant species exhibited both a high flexibility of the margo and a large overlap between the torus and the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture,</b> allowing the torus to tightly seal the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture.</b> Our results support the hypothesis of seal capillary-seeding as the most likely mode of air-seeding, and suggest that the adhesion of the torus to the pit border may be the main determinant of cavitation resistance in conifers...|$|R
40|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} {{in the nature of}} limitations on maximum tree height, the mechanisms governing ultimate and species-specific height limits are not yet understood, but they likely involve water transport dynamics. Tall trees experience increased risk of xylem embolism from air-seeding because tension in their water column increases with height because of path-length resistance and gravity. We used morphological measurements to estimate the hydraulic properties of the bordered pits between tracheids in Douglas-fir trees along a height gradient of 85 m. With increasing height, the xylem structural modifications that satisfied hydraulic requirements for avoidance of runaway embolism imposed increasing constraints on water transport efficiency. In the branches and trunks, the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter of tracheids decreases steadily with height, whereas torus diameter remains relatively constant. The resulting increase in the ratio of torus to <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter allows the pits to withstand higher tensions before air-seeding but at the cost of reduced <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> conductance. Extrapolations of vertical trends for trunks and branches show that water transport across pits will approach zero at a heights of 109 m and 138 m, respectively, which is consistent with historic height records of 100 – 127 m for this species. Likewise, the twig water potential corresponding to the threshold for runaway embolism would be attained at a height of ≈ 107 m.

30|$|The wood {{properties}} of all 35 logs were measured. Strips 40  mm wide and 30  mm thick were {{cut from the}} discs of the top and butt ends of the log. These strips were then split into small pieces at intervals of 20  mm from pith to bark, parallel to the growth layers and the green weight and volume of each piece were measured using an electronic densimeter MD- 300 S (ALFA MIRAGE). The oven-dry weight was obtained by drying at 105  °C for 24  h. The basic density was calculated as the oven-dry weight per green volume, while the moisture content was calculated as the water-weight per oven-dry weight. The basic density and moisture content were measured with the same piece. The area-weighted mean, based on distance from the pith, was calculated as the mean value of the basic density and moisture content of the discs, sapwood, and heartwood in the top and butt ends, respectively, while the arithmetic mean value of the top and butt ends was calculated as a mean value for the logs. The growth ring width of the butt end was measured using 2 D image analysis software Win ROOF (MITANI CORPORATION). The microfibril angle (MFA) of the butt end was measured every 5 – 6 growth rings by a technique using the slit-like <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> directions.

40|$|Background and Aims: According to the {{air-seeding}} hypothesis, embolism vulnerability in xylem elements {{is linked}} directly to bordered pit structure and functioning. To elucidate the adaptive potential of intervessel pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate intervessel pits in A. marina and scalariform intervessel pits in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: Vestured pits without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its outer <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in intervessel pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their intervessel pits. Within species, intervessel pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter. Further research on pit formation and function has to clarify the large variations in intervessel pit size within trees and even within single vessels...|$|R
40|$|Vestures {{are small}} {{projections}} from the secondary cell wall associated with tracheary {{elements of the}} secondary xylem. They are usually associated with bordered pits and characterize various angiosperm families, including important timber species such as Dipterocarpaceae and Eucalyptus trees.

Vestures are consistently present near the outer <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with inner <b>pit</b> <b>apertures,</b> inner vessel walls, simple perforation plates, depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or fibre-tracheids. A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire pit chamber is the most common vestured pit type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{increasing}} mean temperatures {{and in the}} eastern Mediterranean is expected to decrease annual precipitation. The resulting increase in aridity may be too rapid for adaptation of tree species unless their gene pool already possesses variation in drought resistance. Vulnerability to embolism, estimated by the pressure inducing 50 % loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity (P 50), is strongly associated with drought stress resistance in trees. Yet, previous studies on various tree species reported low intraspecific genetic variation for this trait, and therefore limited adaptive capacities to increasing aridity. Here we quantified differences in hydraulic efficiency (xylem hydraulic conductance) and safety (resistance to embolism) in four contrasting provenances of Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) in a provenance trial, which is indirect evidence for genetic differences. Results obtained with three techniques (bench dehydration, centrifugation and X-ray micro-CT) evidenced significant differentiation with similar ranking between provenances. Inter-provenance variation in P 50 correlated with pit anatomical properties (torus overlap and <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> size). These results suggest that adaptation of P. halepensis to xeric habitats {{has been accompanied by}} modifications of bordered pit function driven by variation in <b>pit</b> <b>aperture.</b> This study thus provides evidence that appropriate exploitation of provenance differences will allow continued forestry with P. halepensis in future climates of the Eastern Mediterranean...|$|R
40|$|Water {{transport}} in conifers occurs through single-celled tracheids {{that are}} connected to one another via intertracheid pit membranes. These membranes have two components: the porous margo, which allows water {{to pass through the}} membrane, and the impermeable torus, which functions to isolate gas-filled tracheids. During drought, tracheids can become air filled and thus hydraulically dysfunctional, a result of air entering through the pit membrane and nucleating cavitation in the water column. What are the hydraulic tradeoffs associated with cavitation resistance at the pit level, and how do they vary within the structural components of the intertracheid pit? To address these questions, we examined pit structure in 15 species of Cupressaceae exhibiting a broad range of cavitation resistances. Across species, cavitation resistance was most closely correlated to the ratio of the torus to <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter but did not vary systematically with margo porosity. Furthermore, our data indicate that constraints on pit hydraulic efficiency are shared: the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> limits <b>pit</b> conductivity in more drought-resistant taxa, while increased margo resistance is more likely to control pit conductivity in species that are more vulnerable to cavitation. These results are coupled with additional data concerning pit membrane structure and function and are discussed {{in the context of the}} evolutionary biogeography of the Cupressaceae...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{resistance}} {{is a key}} parameter to understand tree drought tolerance but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms of air entry into xylem conduits. For conifers three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) a rupture of pit margo microfibrils, (2) a displacement of the pit torus from its normal sealing position over the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture,</b> and (3) a rupture of an air-water menisci in a pore of the pit margo. In this article, we report experimental results on three coniferous species suggesting additional mechanisms. First, when xylem segments were injected with a fluid at a pressure sufficient to aspirate pit tori and well above the pressure for cavitation induction we failed to detect the increase in sample conductance that should have been caused by torus displacement from blocking the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> or by membrane rupture. Second, by injecting xylem samples with different surfactant solutions, we found a linear relation between sample vulnerability to cavitation and fluid surface tension. This suggests that cavitation in conifers could also be provoked by the capillary failure of an air-water meniscus in coherence with the prediction of Young-Laplace's equation. Within the bordered pit membrane, the exact position of this capillary seeding is unknown. The possible Achilles' heel could be the seal between tori and pit walls or holes in the torus. The mechanism of water-stress-induced cavitation in conifers could then be relatively similar to the one currently proposed for angiosperms...|$|R

Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> (coalesced <b>pit</b> <b>apertures),</b> and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody.

40|$|Across land plants {{there is}} a general pattern of xylem conduit diameters {{widening}} towards the stem base thus reducing the accumulation of hydraulic resistance as plants grow taller. In conifers, xylem conduits consist of cells with closed end-walls and water must flow through bordered pits imbedded in the side walls. As a consequence both cell size, which determines the numbers of walls that the conductive stream of water must cross, as well as the characteristics of the pits themselves, crucially affect total hydraulic resistance. Because both conduit size and pit features influence hydraulic resistance in tandem, we hypothesized that features of both should vary predictably with one another. To test this prediction we sampled a single tall (94. 8 m) Sequoiadendron giganteum tree (giant sequoia), collecting wood samples from the most recent annual ring progressively downwards from the tree top to the base. We measured tracheid diameter and length, number of pits per tracheid, and the areas of <b>pit</b> <b>apertures,</b> tori, and margos. Tracheid diameter widened from treetop to base following a power law with an exponent (tracheid diameterstem length slope) of approximately 0. 20. A similar scaling exponent was found between tracheid length and distance from tree top. Additionally, <b>pit</b> <b>aperture,</b> torus, and margo areas all increased (again with a power of ∼ 0. 20) with distance from tree top, paralleling the observed variation in tracheid diameter and length. Pit density scaled isometrically with tracheid length. Within individual tracheids, total permeable area of pits, measured as the sum of the margo areas, scaled isometrically with lumen area. Given that pores of the margo membrane are believed to increase in parallel with membrane area, from a strictly anatomical perspective, our results support the interpretation that pit resistance remains a relatively constant fraction of total resistance along the hydraulic pathway. © 2016 International Association of Wood Anatomists...|$|R

Distinct regions with possibly different functions were recognisable in the bushy thallus of Plocamium cartilagineum. Chloroplasts were concentrated in the outermost cell layer, while in the other cortex cells abundant floridean starch accumulated. No starch was found in the large medullary cells, characterised by the insertion in their walls of several large and <b>lenticular</b> <b>pit</b> connections devoid of plug caps and proteic in nature.

These acidic phycocolloids were particularly concentrated in the cell wall proper, which also exhibited a well organised fibrillar component probably consisting of cellulose. The distinctive feature of the Antarctic thalli, compared with the Mediterranean ones, was the lack, in the former, of recognisable phycobilisomes on the thylakoid surfaces. This peculiarity had already been noticed in the other Antarctic red alga Iridaea cordata, collected, like Plocamium cartilagineum, in summer and from ice free waters.

A negative correlation was found between P 50 and intervessel pit membrane thickness, but this relationship was not supported by the PIC analysis. Cavitation resistance has co-evolved with vessel grouping within Prunus and was mainly influenced by the spatial distribution of the vessel network...|$|R
40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of pit membranes {{are reported to}} have important implications in understanding air-seeding phe-nomena in gymnosperms, and pit aspiration plays {{a large role in}} wood technological applications such as wood drying and preservative treatment. Here we present force–displacement measurements for pit membranes of circular bordered pits, collected on a mesomechanical testing system. The system consists of a quartz microprobe attached to a micro-force sensor that is positioned and advanced with a micromanipulator mounted on an inverted microscope. Membrane displacement is measured from digital image analysis. Unaspirated pits from earlywood of never-dried wood of Larix and Pinus and aspirated pits from earlywood of dried wood of Larix were tested to generate force– displacement curves up to the point of membrane failure. Two failure modes were observed: rupture or tearing of the pit membrane by the microprobe tip, and the stretching of the pit membrane until the torus was forced out of the pit chamber through the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> without rupture, a condi-tion we refer to as torus prolapse.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of intervascular pit membranes with a torus {{was investigated in}} juvenile wood samples of 19 species of Ulmus and seven related genera. • A staining solution of safranin and alcian blue (35 : 65) was recommended to distinguish torus-bearing pit membranes using light microscopy. • Intervascular pit membranes connecting relatively wide vessel elements resembled those of most angiosperms, as they were of uniform thickness. By contrast, bordered pit pairs with round to oval <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> and indistinct <b>pit</b> canals that connected narrow (incomplete) vessel elements or vascular tracheids with distinct helical thickenings were frequently characterized by a torus in ring-porous wood samples of Ulmus and Zelkova. Tori were lacking in diffuse-porous species of Ampelocera, Aphananthe, Gironniera, Holoptelea, Phyllostylon, Trema and Ulmus. • Our observations suggest that tori are more common in cold temperate climates than in warm (sub) tropical environments. This may indicate that narrow tracheary elements with torus-bearing pit membranes provide an auxiliary conducting system which is of low conductivity, but offers greater resistance to freezing-induced cavitation...|$|R
40|$|Cross-field pitting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} characters for softwood identifi cation. During charcoalification, a range of severe qualitative and quantitative modifications may occur in cross-field pitting. As most fossil or archaeological wood remains are preserved as charcoal (fusain), the question arises whether these modifications hamper the accurate identification of some taxa. This work is a systematic biometric study of a wide range of gymnosperm cross-field pitting after experimental charcoalification. We focused on the window-like, piceoid, taxodioid, cupressoid, araucarioid and podocarpoid cross-field pitting types. Our main results are the following: 1) Cross-field pits of wood specimens dried out before charcoalification are hidden by a thin closing wall; in this case, it is often impossible to discriminate between the various types of cross-field pitting. 2) Piceoid cross-field pitting becomes taxodioid-like after charcoalification. 3) Biometric study of charred softwood cross-field pitting dimensions shows that the ratios between height and width of <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> and border allow us to distinguish and characterise four types of pitting (window-like, piceoid, taxodioid, cupressoid + araucarioid + podocarpoid [= CAP]). The discrimination within the CAP type requires further investigation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{micromorphology}} of pits in {{tracheary elements}} was examined in 35 species representing 29 genera of Rosaceae and related families {{to evaluate the}} assumption that angiosperm pits are largely invariant. In most Rosaceae, pit membranes between fibers and tracheids frequently appear to have amorphous thickenings with an irregular distribution. Although these structures are toruslike under the light microscope, observations by electron microscopy illustrate that they represent ‘‘pseudotori’’ or plasmodesmata-associated thickenings. These thickenings frequently extend from {{the periphery of the}} pit membrane and form a cap-like, hollow structure. Pseudotori are occasionally found in few Elaeagnaceae and Rhamnaceae and appear to be related to species with fiber-tracheids and/or tracheids. True tori are strongly associated with round to oval <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> and are consistently present in narrow tracheary elements of Cercocarpus (Rosaceae), Planera (Ulmaceae), and ring-porous species of Ulmus and Zelkova (Ulmaceae). Vestured pits with homogenous pit membranes are reported for Hemiptelea (Ulmaceae). The homoplastic nature of pit membrane characteristics may be related to functional adaptations in terms of safety and efficiency of water transport or may reflect different developmental processes of xylem elements. These observations illustrate that there is more variation in angiosperm pits than previously thought. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 21 collections of Berberis and one each of Epimedium, Jeffersonia, and Nandina. Most species of Berberis have {{large numbers of}} narrow vessels ~ixed with vasicentric tracheids. Scalariform perforation plates are reported here only for Epimedium, m wh 1 ch they are occasional. Berberidaceae have living fibers (Berberis), fiber-tracheids plus living fibers (Nandina), or tracheids (Jeffersonia) as imperforate tracheary elements. Axial parenchyma is reported here for Jeffersonia and one species of Berberis. Previous reports of axial parenchyma in Berberis and Nandina likely refer to undivided living fibers, mostly intermixed with vessels, which are slightly shorter and with thinner walls and larger <b>pit</b> <b>apertures</b> than living fibers elsewhere in the wood. Woods of Berberis and other Berberidaceae are remarkably xeromorphic. The wide, tall rays of Berbendaceae, other than Jeffersonia, resemble rays of Clematis (Ranunculaceae) and other Ranunculiflorae. In dimensions, these rays suggest herbaceousness, but abundance of procumbent cells in these rays is not juvenilistic. No consistent differences in wood separate the subgenera Berberis and Mahonia of Berberis: although the two subgenera differ modally in several respects. Wood anatomy of Nandma IS {{very similar to that}} of Berberis, and segregation of Nandinaceae is unwarranted on the basis of wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen Norway spruces [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ], {{randomly}} sampled as 7 fast-grown and 7 slow-grown trees, {{were used}} to test whether an increased tree growth rate in circumference affects the intra-ring and inter-ring trajectories of the microfibril angle in the S- 2 layer of the tracheid wall. Those trajectories describe the fluctuations of the S- 2 microfibril angle, respectively, from earlywood to latewood within rings and from pith to bark among rings. Using the cross-field <b>pit</b> <b>apertures,</b> intra-ring measures of microfibril angle were made at 11 equally-spaced sampling sites over each of 8 growth rings, following an 11 x 8 doubly repeated measures design with the tree as the 'subject' on which repeated measures were made. All the intra-ring trajectories of microfibril angle decreased linearly from earlywood to latewood, whereas the intra-ring trajectories showed significant year effects. Both types of trajectories are significantly affected by the growth rate after first thinning, as the fast-grown spruces showed a systematically larger microfibril angle and a mean microfibril angle of 29 degrees compared to 21 degrees for the slow-grown spruces. Thus, lower tensile and tear strengths of tracheids {{as well as some}} modifications of the mechanical properties of solid wood and paper can be expected from Norway spruces growing faster than 2. 2 cm/year in circumference...|$|R
30|$|Two {{experimental}} {{techniques were}} {{used to test the}} water permeability of two Korean hardwood species: diffuse porous Populus tomentiglandulosa T. Lee (eunsasi poplar) and ring porous white oak, Quercus serrata Thunb (konara oak). The first technique measured the void volume filled at different moisture content (MC) levels. Samples were treated with water via a schedule of full-cell impregnation. A significant relation between MC and permeability (the fractional void volume) was found. A reduction in liquid permeability was observed at MC above the fiber saturation point (FSP), whereas the opposite result was observed at MC below FSP due to the effect of the voids available in the wood. However, the differences of increased permeability from MC level 20 % to 0 % were found satistically the same in either wood species. The second technique measured the speed of liquid penetration in vessels, fibers, and rays with no application of external pressure. In this method, liquid flow was captured via video and the penetration speed was measured. Vessels, fibers, and rays in poplar were found to be more permeable than those in oak. Different anatomical factors such as cell diameter, cell length, <b>pit</b> number, <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> area, and thickness of the pit membrane seemed to be responsible for the variation of liquid flow rate in different cells of the two hardwood species.|$|R
30|$|Conifer is the {{dominant}} group of the permineralized woods in the Tiaojishan Formation. Sciadopitys, a living monotypic genus (S. verticillata (Thunb.) Sieb. et Zucc) of the family Sciadopityaceae, is always considered as a relic plant endemic to Japan, though it has been cultivated {{in other parts of}} the world (Wu et al. 1996). Although the extant Sciadopitys is extremely limited in its current distribution, it occurs widely in the Cenozoic record in the form of fossil leaves, seed cones and wood (Menzel 1913; Christophel 1973; Sveshnikova 1981; Manum 1987; Bose and Manum 1990, 1991; Ohsawa et al. 1991; Florin 1922 a, b; Saiki 1992; Mosbrugger et al. 1994). The unique structures of living Sciadopitys that differentiate this genus from other conifers are the sub-taxodioid cross-field pits with an extended <b>pit</b> <b>aperture,</b> and the window-like cross-field pits (Zhou and Jiang 1994; Jiang et al. 2010 b). In contrast, the anatomical structure of Sciadopitys-like fossil xylem is rarely documented. A new Sciadopitys-like wood was found in the Tiaojishan Formation (Jiang et al. 2012). From a palaeobiogeographic point of view, although the extant Sciadopitys is endemic to Japan, its ancestors may have existed in China during the Early and Middle Jurassic, flourished in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and may have migrated from China to western Europe and northwestern Canada. Since the Cretaceous, due to considerable changes in palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment, sciadopityaceous conifers became extinct in China, Europe and North America, but still survived in Japan (Farjon 2005).|$|R
40|$|Pits form a major pathway for liquid fl ow in wood. In conifers, such as radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), pits between axial tracheids {{are highly}} {{specialised}} structures, with cell walls overarching a membrane. The membrane {{consists of a}} central impervious torus, which is suspended in the pit cavity by a highly porous margo. The bordered pits in radiata pine become aspirated during drying of timber, a condition where the torus becomes lodged against the <b>pit</b> <b>aperture</b> and seals it, thus infl uencing timber permeability / penetrability. To enhance timber treatability we have employed an environmentally compatible biological process to remove pit membranes, thus facilitating greater fl ow of applied wood property enhancing solutions through pits. The biological modifi cation process we employed involved placing freshly sawn radiata pine boards in water in plastic troughs in a glasshouse, and keeping them submerged for periods suffi cient for the natural bacterial microfl ora to colonise wood and destroy pit membranes. The boards {{were removed from the}} troughs after 2 - 12 weeks and examined by a range of microscopy techniques, including fl uorescence confocal microscopy, fi eld emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which provided evidence of bacterial colonisation of pit membranes and pit membrane destruction. The microscopic assessment of wood permeability indicated that penetration depth of applied coating was signifi cantly greater in the ponded wood compared with the unponded (control) wood.
