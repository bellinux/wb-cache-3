And suppose Germany had dropped one bomb, say, on Rochester {{and the other on}} Buffalo, and then having run out of bombs she would have lost the war. Can anyone doubt that we would then have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and that we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them? ...|$|R

That we might have any day if Lydia or Betty would show some of the alacrity which got a good husband for Alice. Isaac is a free man and we expect his marriage will bring about peace with a powerful tribe of Indians. To us, and particularly to you, young people, that is a matter of great importance. The friendship of the Hurons cannot but exert an influence on other tribes. I, myself, may live to see the day that my dream shall be realized--peaceful and friendly relations with the Indians, the freedom of the soil, well-tilled farms and growing settlements, and at last, the opening of this glorious country to the world. Therefore, let us rejoice; let every one be happy; let your gayest laugh ring out, and tell your best story." ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> {{to finish}} <b>this</b> review, that the {{achievements}} of Field"s book are undeniable. He offers a paracomplete logic that preserves the principles and features that enable us to use the truth predicate as a logical device of quantification over sentences. His logic, moreover, validates an impressively high number of classical principles and contains an operator {{that can be used}} to characterize paradoxical sentences without at least apparently falling prey of new paradoxes. That is, doubtless, a remarkable feat and the use Field makes of fixed point constructions and revision rules, together with his discussion of well-known solutions to the Liar Paradox constitute a major contribution to the literature on this topic. If my remarks here pursue often what the book leaves out (rather than what it contains), that is, partly, because I think that the real philosophical significance of Field"s achievements will emerge in discussing some of the issues that could not be developed in STFP...|$|R
60|$|Your reviewer, Sir, while {{admitting that}} the story in {{question}} is 'plainly {{the work of a}} man of letters,' the work of one who has 'brains, and art, and style,' yet suggests, and apparently in all seriousness, that I have written it in order that it should be read by the most depraved members of the criminal and illiterate classes.

6000|$|From Coburg, Friedrich Wilhelm, after pause again unknown, rushed on to Bamberg; new {{scenes and}} ever new opening {{on the eyes}} of our young Hero and his Papa. The course is down {{the valley of the}} Itz, one of the many little valleys in the big slope of the Rodach; for the waters are now turned, and all streams and brooks are gurgling incessantly towards the Mayn. Towards Frankfurt, Mainz and the Rhine,--far enough from the Saale, Mulde, or the Old Dessauer's Bridge to-day; towards Rotterdam and the uttermost Dutch swamps today. Near upon Bamberg we cross the Mayn itself; Red Mayn and White conjoined, coming from Culmbach and Baireuth,--mark that, your Highness. A country of {{pleasant}} hills and vines: and in an hour hence, through thick fir woods,--each side of your road horribly decked with gibbeted thieves swinging aloft, [Pollnitz, Memoirs and Letters (English Translation, London, 1745), i. 209. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> again, <b>this</b> is a different Book from the [...] "MEMOIRS of Pollnitz;" [...] and a still different from the MEMOIREN, or [...] "Memoirs of Brandenburg BY Pollnitz:" [...] such the excellence of nomenclature in that old fool!]--you arrive at Bamberg, chief of Bishoprics, the venerable town; whose Bishop, famous in old times, is like an Archbishop, and [...] "gets his pallium direct from the Pope,"--much good may it do him!

5000|$|... "It {{finish in}} the straw poll was disappointing. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>say,</b> Jake, <b>this</b> has been an {{incredible}} process. It's been a great honor for Mary and me and our team to convey the message {{of trying to get}} this country back on track -- and I think it is off-track -- but bringing my record forward as a two-term governor of a blue state, doing things like getting government spending under control, doing health care reform the right way, and much more. But obviously that message didn't get the kind of traction or lift that we needed and hoped for coming {{into and out of the}} Ames straw poll. We needed to get some lift to continue on and to have a pathway forward. That didn't happen. So I'm announcing this morning on your show that I'm going to be ending my campaign for president, but I'm very, very grateful for the people of Iowa, the people of this country, who I had a chance to make my case to, and for my supporters and staff and friends who've been so loyal and helpful.

6000|$|MR. DEPUTY-SPEAKER, I {{think the}} House will allow {{me in the}} remarks that I wish to make, {{to refer to a}} {{communication}} that I had received, namely, the decision arrived at by the Transvaal Government in respect to the question of Asiatics. Everybody in the House is aware of the enormous interest, even passionate interest, that has been taken in this subject, especially in India, and for very good reasons. Without further preface <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> is the statement received by Lord Elgin from the Government of the Transvaal last night:--"Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian and Chinese communities have offered voluntary registration in a body within three months, provided signatures only are taken of educated, propertied, or well-known Asiatics, and finger-prints of the others, and that no question against which Asiatics have religious objections be pressed. The Transvaal Government have accepted this offer, and undertaken, pending registration, not to enforce the penalties under the Act against all those who register. The sentences of all Asiatics in prison will be remitted to-morrow." [...] Lord Selborne adds, [...] "This course was agreed to by both political parties." [...] I am sure that everybody in the House will think that very welcome news. I do not like to let the matter drop without saying a word--I am sure Lord Elgin would like me to say it--in recognition of the good spirit shown by the Transvaal Government.|$|E
6000|$|It is an {{enormous}} satisfaction to me to find myself here once more, {{the first time since}} the polling, and since the splendid majority that these burghs were good enough to give me. I value very much what the Provost has said, when he told you that I have never, though I have had pretty heavy burdens, neglected the local business of Arbroath and the other burghs. The Provost truly said that I hold an important and responsible office under the Crown; and I hope that fact will be the excuse, if excuse be needed, for my confining myself to-night to a single topic. When I spoke to a friend of mine in London the other day he said, [...] "What are you going to speak about?", and I told him. He is a very experienced man and he said, [...] "It is a most unattractive subject, India." [...] At any rate, this is the last place where any apology is needed for speaking about India, because it is you who are responsible for my being the Indian Minister. If your 2,500 majority had been 2,500 the other way, I should have been no longer the Indian Minister. There is something that strikes the imagination, something that awakens a feeling of the bonds of mankind, in the thought that you here and in the other burghs--(shipmen, artificers, craftsmen, and shopkeepers living here)--are brought through me, and through your responsibility in electing me, into contact with all these hundreds of millions across the seas. Therefore it is that I will not make any apology to you for my choice of a subject to-night. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> not only to you gentlemen here, but to all British constituencies--that it is well you should have patience enough to listen to a speech about India; because it is no secret to anybody who understands, that if the Government were to make a certain kind of bad blunder in India--which I do not at all expect them to make--there would be short work for a long time to come, with many of those schemes, upon which you have set your heart. Do not dream, if any mishap of a certain kind were to come to pass in India that you can go on with that programme of social reforms, all costing money and absorbing attention, in the spirit in which you are now about to pursue it.|$|E
5000|$|Irwin, John T. (as John Bricuth), Just <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Say</b> <b>This</b> About That, Sewanee Writers' Series (New York: Overlook Press, 1998).|$|E
30|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say</b> {{first that}} <b>this</b> is an {{important}} book, with a challenging and provocative argument. One reason {{why it is so}} challenging is that, if you take the conclusions of the authors seriously—and they draw all of the logical connections among the data, making it difficult to avoid their conclusions—then it appears {{that we are in a}} crisis in the study of Hinduism. Actually, the argument of the book has implications also for religious studies more broadly, inasmuch as it reveals the shaky presuppositions on which much of modern textual-critical scholarship, particularly but not only as applied to non-Western traditions, rests. Similar criticisms have been leveled at Western scholarship before. The complaint that European studies of other traditions express a bias toward the “original meaning” contained in textual form, a bias borrowed from the post-Reformation study of the Bible, is hardly new. What is innovative and impressive in Adluri and Bagchee’s approach is the thoroughness with which they document the history and consequences of this bias at the heart of supposedly “scientific” (wissenschaftlich) German Indology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as the extent to which individual scholars’ reconstructions of the Mahābhārata and the Bhagavad Gītā were so variable, arbitrary, and tendentious. One is left at the end with a strong suspicion, or possibly even an unshakeable conviction, that elements of this bias continue, insofar as the method of disassembling and reassembling Hindu texts, irrespective of their received form and interpretation within India, in order to arrive at an “Urtext” continues, long after the separation of academic Indology from Protestant bible studies.|$|R
6000|$|... "High-minded lord, the renown of your worthiness, and the valour {{of these}} your knights, which echoes {{from sea to}} sea, {{encourages}} me to hope, that two pilgrims who {{have come from the}} ends of the world to behold you, will not have encountered their fatigue in vain. And to the end that I may not hold your attention too long with speaking, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> briefly <b>say,</b> that <b>this</b> knight here, Uberto of the Lion, a prince renowned also for his achievements, has been wrongfully driven from out his dominions; and that I, who was driven out with him, am his sister, whose name is Angelica. Fame has told us of the jousting this day appointed, and of the noble press of knights here assembled, and how your generous natures care not to win prizes of gold or jewels, or gifts of cities, but only a wreath of roses; and so the prince my brother has come to prove his own valour, and to say, that if any or all of your guests, whether baptised or infidel, choose to meet him in the joust, he will encounter them one by one, in the green meadow without the walls, near the place called the Horseblock of Merlin, by the Fountain of the Pine. And his conditions are these,--that no knight who chances to be thrown shall have license to renew the combat in any way whatsoever, but remain a submissive prisoner in his hands; he, on the other hand, if himself be thrown, agreeing to take his departure out of the country with his giants, and to leave his sister, for prize, {{in the hands of the}} conqueror." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{would seem}} little need for {{proceeding}} further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby's interment. But ere parting with the reader, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>say,</b> that if <b>this</b> little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity {{as to who}} Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator's making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear {{a few months after}} the scrivener's decease. Upon what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The report was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:--the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:--he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.|$|R
