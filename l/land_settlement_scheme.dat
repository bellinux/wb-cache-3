2500|$|In 1921 two {{returned}} servicemen, Leonard Overheu and Frederick Hay, {{applied for}} a grant under the War Service <b>Land</b> <b>Settlement</b> <b>Scheme.</b> Nulla Nulla station was excised from the Marndoc Aboriginal reserve with the traditional owners, the King River Aborigines, removed and forced {{to live on the}} outskirts of Wyndham. By late 1925 the Kimberleys had suffered two years of severe drought. Heavy rains in early 1926 filled the waterholes, which resulted in large groups of Aborigines entering the Marndoc reserve, killing cattle for food. Hay and Overheu had been complaining about the spearing of their cattle, claiming it was [...] "part of a conspiracy" [...] against Nulla Nulla by the Rev. Ernest Gribble of the nearby Forrest River Mission (later renamed Oombulgurri). In response, Sergeant Buckland from Wyndham had the station declared a prohibited area under the 1905 Aborigines Act preventing Aborigines from entering or crossing it to reach other areas. On 18 May, Overheu made a formal complaint that a large mob of Aborigines were spearing cattle on the station and along with Aboriginal employee Tommy Doort, his wife Lyddie and two stock boys camped on the lower Pentecost River to await the arrival of police.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have now}} to {{consider}} the rather deadly matter of demobilisation. One hears the suggestion that not more than 30,000 men shall be disbanded per week; this means two years at least. Conceive millions of men whose sense of sacrifice has been stretched to the full for a definite object which has been gained--conceive them held in a weary, and, {{as it seems to}} them, unnecessary state of suspense. Kept back from all they long for, years after the reality of their service has departed! If this does not undermine them, I do not know what will. Demobilisation--they say--must be cautious. [...] "No man should be released till a place in the industrial machine is ready waiting for him!" [...] So, in a counsel of perfection, speak the wise who have not been deprived of home life, civil liberty, and what not for a dismal length of two, three, and perhaps four years. No! Demobilisation should be as swift as possible, and risks be run to make it swift. The soldier-workman who goes back to civil life within two or three months after peace is signed goes back with a glow still in his heart. But he who returns with a rankling sense of unmerited, unintelligible delay--most prudently, of course, ordained--goes back with [...] "cold feet" [...] and a sullen or revolting spirit. What men will stand under the shadow of a great danger from a sense of imminent duty, they will furiously chafe at when that danger and sense of duty are no more. The duty will then be to their families and to themselves. There is no getting away from this, and the country will be well advised not to be too coldly cautious. Every one, of course, must wish to ease to the utmost the unprecedented economic and industrial confusion which the signing of peace will bring, but it will be better to risk a good deal of momentary unemployment and discontent rather than neglect the human factor and keep men back long months in a service of which they will be deadly sick. How sick they will be may perhaps be guessed at from the words of a certain soldier: [...] "After the war you'll have to have conscription. You won't get a man to go into the army without!" [...] What is there to prevent the Government from beginning now to take stock of the demands of industry, from having a great <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>scheme</b> cut and dried, and devising means for the swiftest possible demobilisation? The moment peace is signed the process of re-absorption into civil life should begin at once and go on without interruption as swiftly as the actual difficulties of transport permit. They, of themselves, will hold up demobilisation quite long enough. The soldier-workman will recognise and bear with the necessary physical delays, but he will not tolerate for a moment any others for his so-called benefit.[A] ...|$|E

50|$|In 1840 the Western Australian Land Company {{was formed}} in London {{with the purpose of}} {{promoting}} a large <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>scheme</b> in the Colony of Western Australia.

50|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was a period of severe {{economic}} decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the Morant Bay rebellions of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of crown colony status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown <b>Lands</b> <b>Settlement</b> <b>Scheme</b> was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Talbot emigrated in 1791, {{where he}} became {{personal}} secretary to John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Talbot convinced the government {{to allow him to}} implement a <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>scheme</b> of 5000 acre in Elgin County in the townships of Dunwich and Aldborough in 1803. According to his government agreement, he was entitled to 200 acre for every settler who received 50 acre; in this way he gained an estate of 20000 acre. Talbot's administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers' names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, erasing their entry. Talbot's abuse of power was a contributing factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.|$|E
50|$|Talbot {{immigrated to}} Canada in 1791, {{where he became}} {{personal}} secretary to John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.

He chose property which today is in Elgin County in adjoining townships, Dunwich and Aldborough (today called West Elgin), when his petition for 5000 acre was granted in 1803. It was May 21, 1803 that he landed at a spot which has been called since Port Talbot, and built a log cabin. Nearby, he added a sawmill, a cooper shop, a blacksmith shop, and a poultry house along with a barn. When settlers began to arrive in 1809, Talbot added a gristmill as well.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1763, Sir John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, and First Lord of the Admiralty, acting for {{a private}} {{syndicate}} of London elite, suggested, for the new Treaty of Paris (1763) possessions on the Island of St. John, a <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>scheme</b> encouraging trade and defence, {{along the lines of}} a feudal tenancy. [...] This the 'Egmont Scheme' was soundly rejected, strongly opposed by 'The Lords Commissioner for Trade and Plantations', so an alternative scheme offered by 'The Board of Trade' was taken up, late in 1764, and in revision came to be approved by The King's Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours for his work in connection with South African troops and hospitals in England and was created a baronet on 25 February 1924 for his numerous donations to children's sanatoria, libraries and a homoeopathic research institute. He funded construction of the Beit Quad, Students' Union building and hostel at Imperial College, London. A plaque depicting him by Omar Ramsden is situated in the Beit Quad entrance. He was a generous benefactor of the Johannesburg Art Gallery, and more so with his gifts to the University of Cape Town, of which he turned the first sod in 1920. King Edward's Hospital Fund received £50,000 from Beit in 1928 for the purchase of radium.|$|R

The purpose of McLaren’s study is to explore the attitude of Australians to their country which has always been ambiguous and show how some Australian fiction writers reacted to this particular experience and environment, how they have treated the dream and how they have dealt with reality. McLaren further endeavours to present how in certain respects the dream has been no more than a defence against the worst elements of the reality, and how certain elements of Australia's history, particularly the convict system and the failure of <b>land</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>schemes,</b> have been reflected in fiction in a peculiarly negative attitude. Despite the efforts of social realists to create a romantic myth of equality among common men and a land responding to human care, the most significant element of Australian fiction has been the feeling of defeat and imprisonment...|$|R
