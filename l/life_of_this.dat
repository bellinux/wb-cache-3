25|$|The Roman Empire {{conquered the}} {{territory}} {{west of the}} Danube between 35 and 9 BC. From 9 BC {{to the end of}} the 4th century, Pannonia was part of the Roman Empire, located within part of later Hungary's territory. Here, a 600-strong Roman legion created the settlement Aquincum in AD 41–54. A civil city grew gradually in the neighborhood of the military settlement, and in AD 106 Aquincum became the focal point of the commercial <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area and the capital city of the Pannonian Inferior region. This area now corresponds to the Óbuda district of Budapest, with the Roman ruins now forming part of the modern Aquincum museum. Later came the Huns, who built a powerful empire. After Hunnish rule, the Germanic Ostrogoths, Lombards, and Gepids, and the polyethnic Avars, had a presence in the Carpathian Basin.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotally, gay {{cruising}} {{continued in}} post-war Singapore in back alleys, public parks and toilets. In the most part, this was {{ignored by the}} police and no one was charged under section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code. Meanwhile, transvestite prostitution in Bugis Street became increasingly prominent. The State and mainstream society initially accepted it is as a vaguely undesirable but inevitable vice, similar to the pragmatic and worldly attitudes towards prostitution in the cosmopolitan port-city. With their growing fame, the transvestites of Bugis Street became a tourist attraction, drawing local and foreign visitors every night. Bugis Street and its associated transgender community were by far the most visible face of sexual minorities in the immediate post-war period, much as transgender people had been in traditional Malay society. The difference was that the community was now much more public, urban and multi-ethnic. Prostitution and interaction with international visitors also added a new dimension to the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> community.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} fatigue started {{affecting}} the King Porus, he {{slowly began to}} retire. Throughout the battle, Alexander {{is said to have}} observed with growing admiration, the valor of King Porus and understood that he intended to be killed in combat. Hoping to save the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> competent leader and warrior, Alexander commanded Taxiles to summon Porus for surrender. However, Porus turned indignant on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear at him in furor without listening to his proposal forcing him to take flight on his steed. In such manner many other messengers, dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned, till at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus convinced him to listen to the message of Alexander. Overpowered by thirst, the weary Porus finally dismounted his War-Elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, he allowed himself to be taken to Alexander. On hearing that the Indian King was approaching, Alexander himself rode out to meet him and the famous surrender meeting took place.|$|E

500|$|The Islamic {{concept of}} Taqwa {{is closely related}} to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to [...] "right conduct" [...] or [...] "piety", [...] "guarding of oneself" [...] or [...] "guarding against evil". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the {{ultimate}} source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Johnson {{is among those}} {{commonly}} mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W.

[...] Tolson suggests that [...] "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, [...] "there have never been more difficult times in the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice." ...|$|E

[...] The contract {{is through the}} year 2015. The deal included Braun's $455,000 salary for 2008, and a $2.3 million bonus in 2008. It could increase to $51 million through incentives. Braun also has a no-trade clause {{for the first four}} years, and then a limited no-trade clause allowing him to block deals to 12 teams from 2012 to 2013, and 6 teams from 2014 to 2015. The contract will keep Braun locked up through his age-31 season. It was the largest contract in Brewers' history, surpassing Jeff Suppan's. It was also the largest contract in baseball history given to a player with less than three years' experience. [...] Braun's agent, Nez Balelo, crunched enough numbers to show him what he potentially could have made over the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> contract if he had chosen not to sign it.
