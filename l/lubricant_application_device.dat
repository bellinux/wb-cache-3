40|$|Computer {{software}} for the numerical simulation of solidification and mold filling is an effective design tool for cast structural automotive magnesium components. A review of commercial software capabilities and their validation procedures was conducted. Aside form the software assessment, the program addressed five main areas: <b>lubricant</b> degradation, <b>lubricant</b> <b>application,</b> gate atomization, and heat transfer at metal mold interfaces. A test stand for <b>lubricant</b> <b>application</b> was designed. A sensor {{was used for the}} direct measurement of heat fluxes during <b>lubricant</b> <b>application</b> and casting solidification in graphite molds. Spray experiments were conducted using pure deionized water and commercial die lubricants. The results show that the sensor can be used with confidence for measuring heat fluxes under conditions specific to the die lube application. The data on heat flux was presented in forms suitable for use in HPDC simulation software. Severe jet breakup and atomization phenomena are likely to occur due to high gate velocities in HPDC. As a result of gate atomization, droplet flow affects the mold filling pattern, air entrapment, skin formation, and ensuing defects. Warm water analogue dies were designed for obtaining experimental data on mold filling phenomena. Data on break-up jet length, break-up pattern, velocities, and droplet size distribution were obtained experimentally and was used to develop correlations for jet break-up phenomena specific to die casting gate configurations...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{lubrication}} {{reduces the}} life of wire hoist ropes when they are used in corrosive environments. Although lubricants are added to ropes during the manufacturing process, these lubricants can deteriorate during use, and it is often necessary to add more lubricant to both the interior and exterior of the rope while it is in service. The U. S. Bureau of Mines evaluated the effectiveness of synthetic lubricants, using electromagnetic nondestructive testing (NDT) to measure deterioration in ropes {{while they were in}} service.

40|$|We {{report on}} the synthesis, characterisation, and {{physical}} and tribological properties of halogen-free ionic liquids based on various chelated orthoborate anions with different phosphonium cations, both without halogen atoms in their structure. Important physical properties of the ILs including glass transition temperatures, density, viscosity and ionic conductivity were measured and are reported here. All of these new halogen-free orthoborate ionic liquids (hf-BILs) are hydrophobic and hydrolytically stable liquids at room temperature. As lubricants, these hf-BILs exhibit considerably better antiwear and friction reducing properties under boundary lubrication conditions for steel–aluminium contacts as compared with fully formulated (15 W- 50 grade) engine oil. Being halogen free these hf-BILs offer a more environmentally benign alternative to ILs being currently developed for <b>lubricant</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Lubricant</b> spray <b>application</b> {{experiments}} were {{conducted for the}} die casting process. The heat flux was measured in situ using a differential thermopile sensor for three application techniques. First, the lubricant was applied under a constant flowrate while the nozzle {{was held in the}} same position. Second, the lubricant was applied in a pulsed, static manner, in which the nozzle was held over the same surface while it was turned on and off several times. Third, the lubricant was applied in a sweeping manner, in which the nozzle was moved along the die surface while it was held open. The {{experiments were}} conducted at several die tem-peratures and at sweep speeds of 20, 23, and 68 cm/s. The heat flux data, which were obtained with a sensor that was located in the centre of the test plate, were presented and discussed. The sensor can be used to evaluate lubricants, monitor the consistency of die lubrication process, and obtain useful process data, such as surface temperature, heat flux, and heat transfer coefficients. The heat removed from the die surface during <b>lubricant</b> <b>application</b> is necessary for (a) designing the cooling channels in the die, i. e. their size and placement, and (b) performing accurate numerical simulations of the die casting process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Biocatalysis is {{considered}} as benign and efficient alternative to chemical catalysis for organic syntheses. Lipases {{are the most}} versatile biological catalysts implemented so far with great potential for production of different chemicals and materials in non-conventional reaction media. This thesis presents investigations on lipase catalyzed esterification and transesterification reactions in solvent-free media with a polyol (tri-ol), trimethylolpropane (TMP) to form TMP-trioleate and -cyclic carbonate for <b>lubricant</b> and polymer <b>applications,</b> respectively. Conventional <b>lubricants</b> are mineral oil based and lack biodegradability resulting in their accumulation in the environment. Synthetic esters of polyhydric alcohols and fatty acids are biodegradable and possess desirable technical properties for <b>lubricant</b> <b>applications.</b> Synthesis of TMP-trioleate from oleic acid and TMP catalyzed by commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B, Novozym® 435 (N 435) was studied by varying reaction parameters. The product obtained possesses desirable pour point (- 42 °C) for <b>lubricant</b> <b>applications</b> in sub-zero conditions. The biocatalyst was recycled in reactions at 70 °C for 7 batches, 24 h each, with a half-life of 94 h. The biocatalyst half-life was doubled by washing it with 2 -propanol between the batches. A simplified kinetic model was developed for the lipase-catalyzed reaction {{in order to facilitate}} optimization and design of the process and minimize the amount of resources required for investigations of the process. The methodology used for the kinetic modeling is applicable for similar types of enzymatic reactions involving multi-substrate multi-product systems. Cyclic carbonates are potential monomers for phosgene-/isocyanate-free polycarbonates and polyurethanes that have wide range of applications. Six-membered cyclic carbonates can readily undergo ring-opening polymerization to form aliphatic polycarbonates and polyurethanes and their copolymers. Six-membered cyclic carbonate with hydroxyl functional group was obtained with 75 % yield using a chemoenzymatic process involving lipase B catalyzed transesterification of dimethylcarbonate (DMC) with TMP in the presence of molecular sieve to form linear TMP carbonate followed by thermal cyclization. Performing the reaction in a recirculating flow reactor, higher conversion rates were obtained compared to the batch process, the product was recovered easily without extra separation steps, and the biocatalyst and molecular sieve remained intact for reuse. In silico evaluations of the reaction accompanied with empirical investigations confirmed that lipase B prefers DMC as acyl-donor while TMP and its derivatives, formed {{during the course of the}} reaction, serve as acyl acceptors. The formation of TMP carbonate oligomers hence found to be non-enzymatic and intensified by heat...|$|R

40|$|Feedstocks for {{industrial}} applications ranging from polymers to lubricants are largely derived from petroleum, a non-renewable resource. Vegetable oils with fatty acid structures and storage forms tailored for specific industrial uses offer renewable and potentially sustainable sources of petrochemical-type functionalities. A {{wide array of}} industrial vegetable oils can be generated through biotechnology, but will likely require non-commodity oilseed platforms dedicated to specialty oil production for commercial acceptance. Here we show the feasibility of three Brassicaceae oilseeds crambe, camelina, and carinata, none of which are widely cultivated for food use, as hosts for complex metabolic engineering of wax esters for <b>lubricant</b> <b>applications.</b> Lines producing wax esters > 20 % of total seed oil were generated for each crop and further improved for high temperature oxidative stability by down-regulation of fatty acid polyunsaturation.
