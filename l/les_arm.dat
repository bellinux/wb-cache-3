40|$|International audienceAfter {{failure of}} erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), lenalidomide (LEN) yields {{red blood cell}} (RBC) {{transfusion}} independence (TI) in 20 - 30 % of lower-risk non-del 5 q myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Several observations suggest an additive effect of ESA and LEN in this situation. We performed a randomized phase III study in 131 RBC transfusion-dependent (TD, median transfusion requirement six RBC units per 8 weeks) lower-risk ESA-refractory non-del 5 q MDS. Patients received LEN alone, 10 [*]mg per day, 21 days per 4 weeks (L arm) or LEN (same schedule) + erythropoietin (EPO) beta, 60, 000 [*]U per week (<b>LE</b> <b>arm).</b> In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, erythroid response (HI-E, IWG 2006 criteria) after four treatment cycles (primary end point) was 23. 1 % (95 % CI 13. 5 - 35. 2) in the L arm and 39. 4 % (95 % CI 27. 6 - 52. 2) in the <b>LE</b> <b>arm</b> (P= 0. 044), while RBC-TI was reached in 13. 8 and 24. 2 % of the patients in the L and <b>LE</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively (P= 0. 13). Median response duration was 18. 1 and 15. 1 months in the L and <b>LE</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively (P= 0. 47). Side effects were moderate and similar in the two arms. Low baseline serum EPO level and a G polymorphism of CRBN gene predicted HI-E.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of detraining that occurred during an 8 week period of muscular inactivity following a 12 week training program of artificial computerized functional electrical stimulation cycle ergometry (CFES <b>LE)</b> and <b>arm</b> ergometry. Six spinal cord injured male individuals were followed through an 8 week detraining period that was preceded by a 12 week exercise program including CFES <b>LE</b> and <b>arm</b> ergometry. Maximal graded exercise tests were completed and measurements of peak oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR), ventilation (V(E)) workload, and creatine kinase were taken. Testing occurred at initial training (OT), after 12 weeks of training (12 T), and after 8 weeks of detraining (DT). After the training program, peak VO 2 increased significantly from 0. 562 ± 0. 126 (OT) to 1. 021 ± 0. 247 l/min (12 T, P 2 decreased to 0. 791 ≠ 0. 216 l/min, which was lower than 12 T (P 2 and HR with workload, which were retained after DT. These increases did not reach statistical significance, however. No apparent relationship existed between these values at baseline. There {{were no significant differences in}} submaximal or peak HR of V(E) between the three testing periods. The results indicate that both peripheral muscular adaptations and central distribution adaptations in SCI individuals are partially maintained following 8 weeks of DT from CFES <b>LE</b> and <b>arm</b> ergometry...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To compare tissue {{dielectric}} constant (TDC) values between lymphedematous and non-lymphedematous tissue. Background. Quantitative measurements to early detect breast cancer (BC) treatment-related lymphedema (BCRL) can aid clinical evaluations. Earliest BCRL changes likely occur in skin and subcutis {{and might be}} detected via local skin-tissue water (LTW) changes assessed by TDC measurements at 300 MHz. Methods. TDC measurements were made in both forearms (2. 5 mm depth) of three groups of women (80 subjects per group); 1) healthy women with no BC (NOBC), 2) women with BC but with TDC measurements made prior to their surgery and 3) women with unilateral lymphedema (LE). Results. Except for affected <b>arms</b> of the <b>LE</b> group, measured TDC values for all other arms were on average close to each other, ranging (mean±SD) between 24. 8 ± 3. 3 to 26. 8 ± 4. 9. Contrastingly, TDC values for the <b>LE</b> affected <b>arms</b> were 42. 9 ± 8. 2 which was significantly greater than all other arm TDC values (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Arm TDC ratios, dominant/non-dominant for NOBC, were 1. 001 ± 0. 050 and atrisk/ contralateral for BC were 0. 998 ± 0. 082 with both significantly less (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) than <b>LE</b> group affected/control <b>arm</b> ratios (1. 663 ± 0. 321). Conclusion. TDC values, used as an index of local tissue water, show that breast cancer 61 per se does not significantly change arm tissue water and also shows {{that the presence of}} BCRL does not significantly change local tissue water of non-affected arms. Further, based on the standard deviation of measured arm TDC ratios, an at-risk arm/contralateral arm TDC ratio between 1. 165 and 1. 200 is suggested as a possible threshold to detect pre-clinical lymphedema.

40|$|Breast cancer-related {{lymphedema}} (LE) {{represents an}} important morbidity that jeopardizes breast cancer patients' quality of life. Different attempts to prevent LE brought about {{improvements in the}} incidence of the pathology but LE still represents a frequent occurrence in breast cancer survivors. Over 4 years ago, Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventing Healing Approach (LYMPHA) was proposed and long-term results are reported in this study. From July 2008 to December 2012, 74 patients underwent axillary nodal dissection for breast cancer treatment together with LYMPHA procedure. Volumetry was performed preoperatively in all patients and after 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and once a year. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 45 patients preoperatively and in 30 also postoperatively after at least over 1 year. Seventy one patients had no sign of LE, and volumetry was coincident to preoperative condition. In three patients, LE occurred after 8 - 12 months postoperatively. Lymphoscintigraphy showed the patency of lymphatic-venous anastomoses at 1 - 4 years after operation.

50|$|Of noble birth, {{he adopted}} the {{profession}} of arms and with other Burgundians fought in the English ranks at the Battle of Agincourt. Following {{the foundation of the}} Order of the Golden Fleece in 1430 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, at the Order's chapter meeting in Lille (November 1431) Le Fèvre was appointed its king of arms and he soon became a very influential person at the Burgundian court. As counsellor to the duke of Burgundy, he frequently assisted Philip III in conducting negotiations with foreign powers, and he was an arbiter in tournaments and authority on all questions of chivalry, where his wide expert knowledge of heraldry was highly respected. Recognition of distinction for his services in the form adoubement and knighthood ensued late in Le Fèvre's life: the medieval chronicler Georges Chastellain describes a moving scene at the occasion of the Order's chapter meeting in Bruges in May 1468, where the King of <b>Arms</b> <b>Le</b> Fèvre retired from service on the grounds of old age. Shortly after the Order's tribute in his honour, Le Fèvre died at Bruges of natural causes on 16 June 1468.|$|R
40|$|The JAK/STAT pathway is {{important}} for cellular metabolism. One component, STAT 5 a, is activated in the breast upon prolactin to prolactin receptor (PRLR) binding facilitating the transcription of genes involved in lobule development. STAT 5 a was previously found to be expressed in most normal breast epithelial cells but not in many in situ or invasive carcinomas except secretory carcinomas which retain STAT 5 a expression. This report examines the JAK/STAT pathway in the breast through the detection of PRLR and STAT 5 a. Fifty breast tissues, including benign secretory change, microglandular adenosis, usual and atypical hyperplasia and in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma both usual and secretory, {{were obtained from the}} fi <b>les</b> of the <b>Armed</b> Forces Institute of Pathology. Sections were immunostained with antibodies to PRLR and STAT 5 a. PRLR was minimally detected on the surface of a few normal breast epithelial cells whereas STAT 5 a was greatly expressed in over 80 % of normal cell nuclei. PRLR was also minimally detected in secretory carcinomas expressing STAT 5 a. However, the opposite pattern was seen in breast carcinomas lacking STAT 5 a expression. PRLR was abundantly expressed in these cells. This reversed expression may indicate a JAK/STAT pathway disturbance that could {{play a role in the}} initiation or maintenance of an abnormal breast phenotype...|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Torch {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the torch relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the torch.

40|$|ARM ISA based {{processors}} are {{no longer}} low-cost low-power processors. Nowadays ARM ISA based processor manufacturers are struggling to implement medium-end to high-end processor cores which implies implementing a state-of-the-art out-of-order execution engine. Unfortunately providing efficient out-of-order execution on legacy ARM codes may be quite challenging due to guarded instructions. Predicting the guarded instructions addresses the main serialization impact associated with guarded instructions execution and the multiple definition problem. Moreover guard prediction allows to use a global branch-and-guard history predictor to predict both branches and guards, often improving branch prediction accuracy. Unfortunately such a global branch-and-guard history predictor requires the systematic use of guard predictions. In that case, poor guard prediction accuracy would lead to poor overall performance on some applications. Building on top of recent advances in branch prediction and confidence estimation, we propose a hybrid branch and guard predictor, combining a global branch history component and global branch-and-guard history component. The potential gain or loss due to the systematic use of guard prediction is dynamically evaluated at run-time. Two computing modes are enabled: systematic guard prediction use and high confidence only guard prediction use. Our experiments show that on most applications, {{an overwhelming majority of}} guarded instructions are predicted. Therefore a simple but relatively inefficient hardware solution can be used to execute the few unpredicted guarded instructions. Significant performance benefits are observed on most applications while applications with poorly predictable guards do not suffer from performance loss. Les processeurs exécutant <b>le</b> jeu d'instructions <b>ARM</b> ne sont omniprésents. La demande de puissance de calcul est telle qu'aujourd'hui toutes les techniques jusqu'à prśent réservd́es á la haute performance sont utilisées pour le design de ces processeurs.

50|$|Between September 1939 and June 1940, the French {{submarines}} patrolled in the Northern {{seas and}} the Atlantic, notably {{in front of}} the neutral ports of Spain, Canary Islands, and the Archipelago of the Azores, where a part of the German commercial marine sought refuge, suspected of serving the German U-Boote. Contrary to the Germans, the French officers had for orders and instruction to respect the terms of the London Naval Treaty : the submarines had to manifest their presence to the commercial ships prior to an attack, and only when the crew was driven to safety; all these precautionary measures reduced the efficiency of the submarine <b>arms.</b> <b>Le</b> Redoutable (Le Redoutable) spotted during the night of November 1 a cargo that was navigating with all lights off. The cargo refusing to halt following the request of the submarine, was fired upon warning shots with the 100mm cannon, to which the cargo fired back in direction of the submarine. At that instance, Le Redoutable received a message from British cargo ship Egba which was signaling being attacked by a U-Boot; the French submarine then, understood that the boat was dealing with an ally, accordingly preparations for shots fired were halted and the submarine retreated. In December 1939, the Le Fresnel (Le Fresnel), L'Achéron (L'Achéron), Le Redoutable (Le Redoutable), Le Héros (Le Héros) were sent to search for the German tanker Altmark (10000 tonnage), supplier of German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, {{in the center of the}} Atlantic. The tanker, carrying prisoners of attacked ships by the German cruiser, managed to evade and made way towards Norway. During the winter of 1939-1940, the L'Achille (L'Achille), Le Casabianca, Le Pasteur (Le Pasteur), Le Sfax (Le Sfax) escorted three allied cargo convoys from Helifax until the United Kingdom.

6000|$|There {{was in the}} Duchess's court a {{young fellow}} from the South of France, whose friends had sent him to faire son droit at Paris, where he {{had gone through the}} usual course of {{pleasure}} and studies of the young inhabitants of the Latin Quarter. He had at one time exalted republican opinions, and had fired his shot with distinction at St. Meri. He was a poet of some little note--a book of his lyrics, Les Rales d'un Asphyxie, having made a sensation {{at the time of their}} appearance. He drank great quantities of absinthe of a morning; smoked incessantly; played roulette whenever he could get a few pieces; contributed to a small journal, and was especially great in his hatred of l'infame Angleterre. Delenda est Carthago was tattooed beneath his shirt-sleeves. Fifine and Clarisse, young milliners of the students' district, had punctured this terrible motto on his manly right <b>arm.</b> <b>Le</b> leopard, emblem of England, was his aversion; he shook his fist at the caged monster in the Garden of Plants. He desired to have [...] "Here lies an enemy of England" [...] engraved upon his early tomb. He was skilled at billiards and dominoes, adroit in the use of arms, of unquestionable courage and fierceness. Mr. Jones of England was afraid of M. de Castillonnes, and cowered before his scowls and sarcasms. Captain Blackball, the other English aide-de-camp of the Duchesse d'Ivry, a warrior of undoubted courage, who had been [...] "on the ground" [...] more than once, gave him a wide berth, and wondered what the little beggar meant when he used to say, [...] "Since the days of the Prince Noir, monsieur, my family has been at feud with l'Angleterre!" [...] His family were grocers at Bordeaux, and his father's name was M. Cabasse. He had married a noble in the revolutionary times; and the son at Paris himself himself Victor Cabasse de Castillonnes; then Victor C. de Castillonnes; then M. de Castillonnes. One of the followers of the Black Prince had insulted a lady of the house of Castillonnes, when the English were lords of Guienne; hence our friend's wrath against the Leopard. He had written, and afterwards dramatised a terrific legend describing the circumstances, and the punishment of the Briton by a knight of the Castillonnes family. A more awful coward never existed in a melodrama than that felon English knight. His blanche-fille, of course, died of hopeless love for the conquering Frenchman, her father's murderer. The paper in which the feuilleton appeared died at the sixth number of the story. The theatre of the Boulevard refused the drama; so the author's rage against l'infame Albion was yet unappeased. On beholding Miss Newcome, Victor had fancied a resemblance between her and Agnes de Calverley, the blanche Miss of his novel and drama, and cast an eye of favour upon the young creature. He even composed verses in her honour (for I presume that the [...] "Miss Betti" [...] and the Princess Crimhilde of the poems which he subsequently published, were no other than Miss Newcome, and the Duchess, her rival). He had been one of the lucky gentlemen who had danced with Ethel on the previous evening. On the occasion of the ball, he came to her with a highflown compliment, and a request to be once more allowed to waltz with her--a request to which he expected a favourable answer, thinking, no doubt, that his wit, his powers of conversation, and the amour qui flambait dans son regard, had had their effect upon the charming Meess. Perhaps he had a copy of the very verses in his breast-pocket, with which he intended to complete his work of fascination. For her sake alone, he had been heard to say that he would enter into a truce with England, and forget the hereditary wrongs of his race.|$|R
