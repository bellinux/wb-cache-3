30|$|Subsequent to {{spectrum}} sensing, measurements must {{be reported}} to the entity that decides on whether to grant opportunistic access or not. Concerning information exchange for cooperative sensing in CR networks, Pan et al. [21] provided a solution consisting of transmitting low-data control information in a wideband channel avoiding interference with the <b>licensed</b> <b>activity.</b> Similarly, Masri et al. suggested {{the implementation of a}} common control channel using ultra wide band (UWB) [22]. However, and to the authors' best knowledge, existing literature lacks feasible and practical implementations of message exchange mechanisms among corresponding entities in a CR network.|$|E
30|$|Inspired by [19], in {{this study}} two similar hard-decision rules are introduced. The {{conservative}} rule declares the resource as free from <b>licensed</b> <b>activity</b> if all the UEs report such state; otherwise the channel {{is considered to be}} occupied. On the other hand, the aggressive strategy declares the resource as idle provided a single UE senses the channel as free. However, due to the abovementioned single sensor measurement uncertainty, the different measurements reported over time must be considered in the final decision. That is to say, old measurements must not have the same importance in the final decision as the newest reports due to the fast-changing radio-channel state conditions. Soft-based cooperative decision stands on this idea and, in addition to the abovementioned hard-decision rules, will be also considered in our study.|$|E
40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio (CR), {{the problem of}} limited spectral resources is solved by enabling unlicensed systems to opportunistically utilize the unused licensed bands. Compressive Sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to alleviate the sampling bottleneck in wideband spectrum sensing leveraging the sparseness of the signal spectrum in open-access networks. This has inspired {{the design of a}} number of techniques that identify spectrum holes from sub-Nyquist samples. However, the existence of interference emanating from low-regulated transmissions, which cannot be taken into account in the CS model because of their non-regulated nature, greatly degrades the identification of <b>licensed</b> <b>activity.</b> Capitalizing on the sparsity described by licensed users, this paper introduces a feature-based technique for primary user's spectrum identification with interference immunity which works with a reduced amount of data. The proposed method detects which channels are occupied by primary users' and also identify the primary users transmission powers without ever reconstructing the signals involved. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique for interference suppression and primary user detection. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

30|$|The {{cooperative}} {{decision making}} mechanism will be implemented in the CRM. For a more efficient use of the available spectrum and to fully exploit the opportunistic nature of our scheme, we consider monitoring and decision-making on a per-RB basis instead of on a per-frequency-band basis (i.e., containing several RBs). The input data considered by the decision mechanism includes all the channel state reports from the UEs served by the same eNodeB and the geographical position of the UEs obtained through the aforementioned location services. Every channel state notification creates a new entry in the CRM containing the UE identifier, the estimated geographical location of the UE, the channel or resource monitored, the <b>licensed</b> <b>activity</b> state sensed in that resource and the time in seconds when the channel state report was received. Once all this data is collected from different UEs, the CRM can make decisions about the vacuity of the monitored resources at different locations. The collected sensing reports are classified by their distance to the eNodeB in different ranges, whose width is given by a multiple of the TA resolution (Dist_TA = 10 m). For each range and RB, an independent cooperative decision will be made.|$|E

The proposed method not only detects which frequencies are occupied by primary users' but also identifies the primary users' transmitted power. The basic strategy is to compare the a priori known spectral shape of the primary user with the power spectral density of the received signal. This comparison ismade in terms of autocorrelation by means of a correlation matching, thus avoiding the computation of the power spectral density of the received signal. The essence of the novel interference rejection mechanism lies in preserving the positive semidefinite character of the residual correlation, which is inserted by means of a weighted formulation of the l(1) -minimization. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the technique for interference suppression and primary user detection. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

30|$|Profitable {{electromagnetic}} spectrum for mobile communication applications is a scarce resource whose use is strictly and rigidly licensed by governmental entities (e.g., FCC in the US, OFCOM in the UK, etc.). Besides, current spectrum utilization is not uniform, that is, some bands are heavily exploited while others remain lightly-used, {{both in the}} temporal and spatial domains. Literature refers to these underutilized portions of spectrum as spectrum holes or white spaces [4]. Cognitive radio (CR) has been proposed as a feasible solution to this inefficient use of the radio spectrum [5, 6] providing a set of methodologies and functionalities in order {{to cope with this}} burden. Among the functionalities provided by CR, opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) is devised as a dynamic method to increase the overall spectrum efficiency by allowing non-licensed (a.k.a. cognitive or secondary) users to utilize unused licensed (or primary) spectrum. For this purpose, a correct identification of channela vacuity conditions by means of spectrum awareness techniques becomes fundamental. Specifically, we must ensure that, (1) a channel targeted for secondary use is actually not being utilized by a licensed user; and (2) the channel occupied by a secondary user is promptly vacated if a primary user suddenly appears. Otherwise, OSA might cause a harmful interference with the <b>licensed</b> <b>activity.</b> Considering the abovementioned premises, efficient spectrum awareness enables an opportunistic use of otherwise unutilized idle bands. Noticeably, the Digital TV (DTV) band is a typical example of inefficient spectrum use since, depending on the geographical location, only certain channels are occupied. This fact has been noticed by standardization bodies that are working to make possible spectrum sharing without causing harmful interference to the primary (or licensed) system [7 – 9]. In [10], the use of free TV channels by wireless technologies was studied showing that there is a clear opportunity to enhance the performance of IMT-Advanced systems by exploiting, for instance, the released frequency band resulting from the analog-to-digital TV switch-over, referred to as digital dividend (DD) in literature [11]. Zhao et al. investigated the framework of spectrum sharing schemes based on cognitive sensing for the LTE-A and DTV coexistence [12]. However, less attention was paid on the practical issues related to the implementation of this framework.|$|E
