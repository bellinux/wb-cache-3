The Braves finished in 2nd place with a 49–33 record, as Bob McAdoo captured the NBA MVP Award. McAdoo led the league with 34.5 points per game, while adding 14.1 rebounds per game, which was 4th best in the league.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{surrounded}} the entire harbour area, stretching {{all the way}} from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.|$|E
5|$|The areas NY3 {{passes through}} {{alternate}} between <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of rural area, {{consisting of a}} mix of open terrain and dispersed residences, and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses. NY3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road, the major exception being the section that is concurrent with NY812, which is a principal arterial road. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh, where {{at least part of}} the road is city-maintained. In Watertown, NY3 is locally maintained from Massey Street (southbound US11 junction) to the end of the NY3/NY12 overlap. The route is entirely city-maintained in Plattsburgh.|$|E

After , however, the road bends to the northeast and enters the town of Onondaga and the hamlet of Indian Village, the main population center of the reservation. NY11A quickly runs through the linear community, crossing Hemlock Creek on its way to another lightly developed, mostly wooded stretch along the east bank of Onondaga Creek. The route passes {{only a handful of}} isolated homes before ending at an intersection with US11 on the northern edge of the reservation. The junction is located just south of the hamlet of Nedrow, located along US11 between the Onondaga territory and the Syracuse city line.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{lived in}} England {{for their first}} fifteen years of marriage, {{sometimes}} travelling to the continent for short periods, but mainly dividing their time between London and the countryside. Granville rented a residence in Tixall, Staffordshire before moving to a rental in Wherstead, Suffolk, entertaining society figures at both places. During <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> between 1824 and 1841, Granville served as his country's ambassador to France. The Countess helped entertain Parisian society by serving as hostess, writing detailed accounts that were later published in 1894, 1940, and 1990. Granville resigned the post in 1841 only after becoming ill; {{for the next two}} years, the family travelled across Europe before returning to England in November 1843. They resided in houses in Brighton and London, and spent portions of their time visiting friends and family at their various country estates.|$|E

5|$|The {{north coast}} is gently {{shelving}} with low cliffs and <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of sandy beach, some sections of which, {{especially in the}} northwest, are muddy. The principal coastal feature is Bridgwater Bay, and the only important harbour is at the mouths of the Parrett. The main rivers in Somerset rise in the hills and flow northwards and westwards into the Bristol Channel; these are the Axe, Brue, Parrett and its tributaries, and Exe. The source of the River Axe is at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills. It flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. It splits into two parts which subsequently recombine, and flows across the moors, through Lower Weare and {{to the south of}} Loxton. It passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down and reaches the sea at Weston Bay; it forms the northern boundary of the county.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of rough seas and winds uprooted <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> {{of trees and}} wrecked numerous ships. The entire town of Savanna-la-Mar was nearly destroyed by the hurricane's effects, which included damage to several local churches. The storm also virtually destroyed the communities of Green Island, Lucea, and Negril, where a church remained the only standing structure. In Montego Bay, at least 300people were left homeless, many of whom temporarily lived in the courthouse after losing their homes. A total of 42people {{were killed in the}} city. Several other wharves along the coast were swept away due to the waves and wind. Across western Jamaica, roughly a hundred homes were destroyed, while 5,000buildings were damaged or demolished. Due to the destruction caused by the tropical cyclone, Jamaica governor Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier assessed damage in the western portion of the island. The government of Jamaica ordered the dispatch of artillerymen in order to bring 300tents and other relief supplies to impacted regions. Additionally, money was raised to aid those who became homeless.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2017 playoffs as the {{defending}} Stanley Cup champions, the Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets {{in five games}} before meeting the Capitals in Round 2. After winning {{the first two games}} on the road, Crosby sustained a concussion after getting injured on a slash and cross-check from Alex Ovechkin and Matt Niskanen in Game 3. He missed Game 4 but returned to practice the next day and played in Game 5. The Penguins would eventually eliminate the Capitals in Game 7, with Crosby assisting on the series-winning goal. The Penguins then defeated the Ottawa Senators in a gruelling seven-game series to secure their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final. Crosby had the primary assist on the series-clinching goal, scored by Chris Kunitz in double overtime. Facing the Nashville Predators in the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, Pittsburgh jumped out to a two-game lead, despite being outplayed for <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> in both games. The Predators responded by tying up the series, winning Game 3 and 4 at home. In Game 5, the Penguins' captain delivered a dominant performance, adding three assists in a 6–0 win, passing Lemieux for most Stanley Cup Final points (20) in franchise history. After defeating the Predators 20 in Game 6, the Penguins became the first team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings, and the first {{to do so in the}} salary cap era. Crosby won his second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, only the third player to do so, after Bernie Parent (1974, 1975) and Mario Lemieux (1991, 1992). He finished second in scoring behind Evgeni Malkin with 27 points (eight goals, 19 assists) in 24 games.|$|E
