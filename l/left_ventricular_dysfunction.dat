5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{heart failure}} and stroke are major causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in older people. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve symptoms and survival in <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction.</b> Anticoagulants are effective in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation with aspirin being a less effective alternative. Objectives: to determine the prevalence of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction,</b> health services utilisation and prescribing of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction,</b> and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and anti-platelet/thrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation in older people in the community. Methods: 500 subjects were drawn by two-stage random sampling from 5, 002 subjects aged 70 years and over living at home.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} The hemodialysis procedure may acutely induce regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction.</b> This study evaluated the prevalence, time course, and associated patient- and dialysis-related factors of this entity and {{its association with}} outcome. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Hemodialysis patients (105) on a three times per week dialysis schedule were studied between March of 2009 and March of 2010. Echocardiography was performed before dialysis, at 60 and 180 minutes intradialysis, and at 30 minutes postdialysis. Hemodialysis-induced regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> was defined as an increase in wall motion score in more {{than or equal to}} two segments. Results Hemodialysis-induced regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> occurred in 29 (27 %) patients; 17 patients developed regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> 60 minutes after onset of dialysis. Patients with hemodialysis-induced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> were more often male, had higher <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> mass index, and had worse predialysis <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic function (<b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction). The course of blood volume, BP, heart rate, electrolytes, and acid-base parameters during dialysis did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients with hemodialysis-induced regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> had a significantly higher mortality after correction for age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, cardiovascular history, ultrafiltration volume, <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> mass index, and predialysis wall motion score index. Conclusions Hemodialysis induces regional wall motion abnormalities in a significant proportion of patients, and these changes are independently associated with increased mortality. Hemodialysis-induced regional <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> occurs early during hemodialysis and is not related to changes in blood volume, electrolytes, and acid-base parameters.

25|$|Common {{causes of}} heart failure include {{coronary}} artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or {{the functioning of the}} heart. There are two main types {{of heart failure}}: heart failure due to <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and heart failure with normal ejection fraction depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise. Heart failure {{is not the same as}} myocardial infarction (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} heart failure and symptomatic as well as asymptomatic <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> in the general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 5540 participants of the Rotterdam Study (age 68. 9 +/- 8. 7 years, 2251 men) aged 55 - 95 years, the presence of heart failure was determined by assessment of symptoms and signs (shortness of breath. ankle oedema and pulmonary crepitations) and use of heart failure medication. In 2267 subjects (age 65. 7 +/- 7. 4 years, 1028 men) fractional shortening was measured. The overall prevalence of heart failure was 3. 9 % (95 % CI 3. 0 +/- 4. 7) and did not differ between men and women. The prevalence increased with age, {{with the exception of}} the highest age group in men. Fractional shortening was higher in women and did not decrease appreciably with age. The prevalence of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> (fractional shortening <= 25 %) was approximately 2. 5 times higher in men (5. 5 %, 95 % CI 4. 1 - 7. 0) than in women (2. 2 %, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 2). Sixty percent of persons with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> had no symptoms or signs of heart failure at all.

40|$|Introduction and objectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the {{prognostic}} value of exercise-induced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> in hypertensive Algerian patients with normal resting echocardiography and absence of coronary artery disease. MethodsFrom our database of patients (military hospitals of Algeria) referred for treadmill exercise echocardiography, we identified 91 hypertensive patients with preserved resting <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction (> 50 %), no evidence of structural heart disease, and absence of coronary artery disease on angiography. Overall, 38 patients developed exercise-induced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> (defined as a decrease in <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction below 50 % at peak exercise) and 53 exhibited a normal <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction response to exercise. The mean follow-up was 6. 1 (3. 7) years. End points were all-cause mortality, cardiac death, heart failure, and the composite event of cardiac death or heart failure. ResultsPatients who developed exercise-induced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> were at higher risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio= 3. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 10. 3), cardiac death (hazard ratio= 5. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 29. 4), heart failure (hazard ratio= 8. 9; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 8 - 44. 2), and the composite end point (hazard ratio= 5. 7; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 - 19. 0). In the multivariate analysis, exercise-induced <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> remained an independent predictor of both heart failure (hazard ratio= 6. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 37. 4) and the composite event of cardiac death or heart failure (hazard ratio= 4. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 16. 0).

50|$|Cardiac {{autoimmunity}} {{affects the}} pathogenesis of HIV-related heart disease as HIV-infected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy {{are more likely to}} have cardiac-specific autoantibodies (anti-α-myosin autoantibodies) than HIV-infected patients with healthy hearts and HIV-negative controls. In addition, patients with echocardiographic evidence of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> had a higher chance of having cardiac autoantibodies.Furthermore, impaired myocardial growth and <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>dysfunction</b> may be immunologically mediated as monthly intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in HIV-infected children reduces <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> increases left ventricular wall thickness, and reduces peak left ventricular wall stress. Perhaps this is because immunoglobulins inhibit the cardiac autoantibodies by competing for Fc receptors. Alternatively, the immunoglobulins can reduce the effects or secretions of cytokines and cellular growth factors.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} measuring plasma concentrations of B type natriuretic peptide in the diagnosis of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> in an unselected group of elderly people. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: General practice with four centres in Poole, Dorset. PARTICIPANTS: 155 elderly patients aged 70 to 84 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic characteristics of plasma B type natriuretic peptide measured by radioimmunoassay as a test for <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS: The median plasma concentration of B type natriuretic peptide was 39. 3 pmol/l in patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> and 15. 8 pmol/l in those with normal function. The proportional area under the receiver operator curve was 0. 85. At a cut-off point of 18. 7 pmol/l the test sensitivity was 92 % and the predictive value 18 %. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma concentration of B type natriuretic peptide could be used effectively as an initial test in a community screening programme and, possibly, using a low cut-off point, {{as a means of}} ruling out <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction.</b> It is, however, not a good test to "rule in" the diagnosis, and access to echocardiography remains essential for general practitioners to diagnose heart failure early...|$|R
40|$|ACE inhibitors {{have been}} shown to be {{effective}} in reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction,</b> but their application to clinical practice in this situation is still limited. In part, the failure to prescribe an ACE inhibitor to a patient with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> is due to perceptions regarding their side effects, such as cough and renal dysfunction. Relatively few patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> and a serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl receive an ACE inhibitor in clinical practice. In this situation one should consider an agent such as fosinopril, which is metabolized by the liver as well as secreted by the kidney. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction, fosinopril has been well tolerated without an increase in serum creatinine. In patients who develope cough due to an ACE inhibitor, consideration should be given to an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent, such as losartan. The relative safety and efficacy of an ACE inhibitor compared with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocking agent is being explored in a prospective randomized trial (Evaluation of Losartan In The Elderly [ELITE]), as well as the safety and pharmacological effectiveness of adding an angiotensin II receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor (Randomized Angiotensin receptor antagonists–ACE-inhibitor Study [RAAS]). There may also be a role for the combination of an aldosterone receptor antagonists and an ACE inhibitor in patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction.</b> Once an ACE inhibitor is administered to a patient with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> it should be continued indefinitely. ACE inhibitors may be of value not only in preventing the progression of heart failure but also in reversing endothelial dysfunction and preventing the development of atherosclerosis and its consequences, such as myocardial infarction...|$|R

50|$|There are no {{specific}} diagnostic criteria for TIC, {{and it can}} be difficult to diagnose for a number of reasons.

Previously normal <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction or <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> out of proportion to a patient’s underlying cardiac disease can be important clues to possible TIC.

40|$|Abstract—The {{sympathetic}} overdrive {{that characterizes}} essential hypertension is potentiated when <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy or {{congestive heart failure}} is detected. No information exists, however, on whether {{this is the case}} also for <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction.</b> In 17 untreated hypertensive subjects with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction</b> (age: 47. 72. 9 years, meanSEM), we measured sympathetic nerve traffic (microneurography), heart rate (ECG), and beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure (Finapres) at rest and during baroreceptor deactivation and stimulation. Data were compared with those collected in 20 age-matched normotensive and 20 hypertensive subjects without a diastolic function impairment. Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values were markedly and significantly greater in the 2 hypertensive groups than in the normotensive one (55. 31. 2 and 71. 21. 6 versus 41. 71. 0 bursts per 100 heartbeats, respectively; P 0. 01 for both). For a similar blood pressure elevation, however, the sympathetic nerve traffic increase was significantly greater in patients with than without <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction</b> (28. 9 %; P 0. 05). In the population as a whole, muscle sympathetic nerve traffic was significantly and inversely related to various echocardio-graphic indices of diastolic function. Although baroreflex-heart rate control was significantly attenuated in the 2 hypertensive groups, baroreflex-sympathetic modulation was impaired only in those with diastolic dysfunction. These data provide the first evidence that, in hypertension, activation of the sympathetic nervous system may contribute not only at the blood pressure elevation but also at the development of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction.</b> The sympatheti...|$|R

This study {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} preload reserve in the stroke volume response to exercise in patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> by assessing the relation between stroke volume and late <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic filling during exercise. Background. In patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>dysfunction,</b> the absence of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> distension is the fundamental mechanism explaining the nonaugmentation of stroke volume during exercise. Methods. In 32 patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> and 16 healthy control subjects, mitral and aortic velocities were recorded by Doppler echocardiography at rest and during submaximal supine bicycle exercise. Stroke volume, peak early (E) and late (A) mitral velocities, A/E ratio and end-diastolic filling were measured at rest and during exercise. Results. Stroke volume increased significantly in control subjects but did not change in patients. Peak early mitral velocity increased significantly and {{to the same extent}} in both groups, whereas peak late mitral velocity and end-diastolic filling increased significantly in both groups but more so in control subjects; the A/E ratio increased significantly in control subjects but did not change in patients. In addition, stroke volume correlated significantly with peak late mitral velocity during exercise in patients (r = 0. 72, p < 0. 001). Conclusions. Compared with control subjects, patients with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> systolic <b>dysfunction</b> exhibited limited increases in both stroke volume and late <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> filling during exercise.
