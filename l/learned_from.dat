40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> {{computer}} models is a promising approach to learning. This study investigated how {{three types of}} <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> {{computer models}} {{can be applied to}} teach high-school students (aged 14 – 17) about the process of glucose–insulin regulation. Two traditional forms of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> models (i. e. simulating a predefined model and constructing a model) were compared to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> an erroneous model. In this innovative form of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> computer models, students are provided with a model that contained errors to be corrected. As such, students do not have to engage in the difficult task of constructing a model. Rather, they are challenged to work with and correct the model in order for the simulation to generate correct output. As predicted, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> erroneous models enhances learning of domain-specific knowledge better than running a simulation or constructing a model...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation is to contribute to better <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> safety related incidents and accidents in organisations. The dissertation provides a method to systematically study <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents, by using a model of five phases that represent the actions necessary to successfully follow up on incidents and to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> them. The model builds on existing theories from safety and organisational learning, that are now applied to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents. In addition, this dissertation explains causes for ineffective learning, {{and a set of}} indicators to assess the conditions that facilitate learning, is provided. Through creating and sustaining these conditions in which successful learning is likely to occur, the ability of an organisation to learn improves. Thus, this dissertation increases the understanding of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents by providing empirical findings on how organisations <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> incidents in practice, and on hindrances and successes in the current learning approaches...|$|R

Research on <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> animations reports very inconsistent results concerning the benefits associated with learn-ing from animations. One reason for these inconsisten-cies might be the use of different assessments of learn-ing success. In an experimental study, we used three assessments of learning success. On the basis of these assessments, we compared <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> static pic-tures and <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> animations. With respect to the acquisition of conceptual and procedural knowl-edge, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> animations was more beneficial...|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of {{previous}} research results [12, 13, 16, 20], we propose that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously might be more effective and efficient than <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs in the initial learning phase, and note that the strategy does not lose its effectiveness for proficient learners. Our results indicate that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously requires a significantly lower cognitive-load investment than does <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs for novice learners. One possible explanation {{for this is the}} fact that when <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs, novice learners do not necessarily understand the problem-solving schema they have just studied. When they solve the problems, they must still use search strategies such as mean-ends analysis to deal with the interactive elements they did not fully comprehend, which can impose a high cognitive load. However, students possessing prior skills may be able to reconstruct the problem-solving schema when they study the examples. For them, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously may appear similar to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs. This explanation does not conflict with previous studies, and it supports our finding that learners with better exercise scores in problem solving obtain better test scores.|$|R
