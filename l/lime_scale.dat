5000|$|Portland stone {{formed in}} a marine environment, {{on the floor}} of a shallow, warm, sub-tropical sea {{probably}} near land (as evidenced by fossilized driftwood, which is not uncommon). When seawater is warmed by the sun, its capacity to hold dissolved gas is reduced, consequently dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere as a gas. Calcium and bicarbonate ions within the water are then able to combine, to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as a precipitate. The process of <b>lime</b> <b>scale</b> build up in a kettle in hard water areas is similar. Calcium carbonate is the principal constituent of most limestones. Billions of minute crystals of precipitated calcium carbonate (called calcite) accumulated forming lime mud (called micrite) which covered the sea floor. Small particles of sand or organic detritus, such as shell fragments, formed a nucleus, which became coated with layers of calcite as they were rolled around in the muddy micrite. The calcite gradually accumulated (by accretion) around the fragments of shell in concentric layers, forming small balls (of less than 0.5 mm diameter). This process is similar to the way in which a snowball grows in size as it is rolled around in the snow. Over time, countless billions of these balls, known as [...] "ooids" [...] or [...] "ooliths" [...] (from the Greek for [...] "egg-shaped" [...] or [...] "egg-stone"), became partially cemented together (or lithified) by more calcite, to form the oolitic limestone we now call Portland stone. Fortunately, the degree of cementation in Portland stone is such that the stone is sufficiently well cemented to allow it to resist weathering but not so well cemented that it can't be readily worked (cut and carved) by masons. This is one of the reasons why Portland stone is so favoured as a monumental and architectural stone. Dr Geoff Townson conducted three years doctoral research on the Portlandian, being the first to describe the patch-reef facies and Dorset-wide sedimentation details [...] Dr Ian West of the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Southampton University completed a detailed geological survey of Withies Croft Quarry before the Portland Beds were quarried by Albion Stone plc.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A comprehensive {{review of the literature}} provided much evidence of the success of lime piles in treating both soft ground and slopes. The mechanisms of stabilisation postulated by researchers is often contradictory or misleading. The use of the literature for the basis of a definitive experimental programme was not possible. An iterative approach was adopted for the laboratory programme whereby the results from one series of tests were used {{in the design of the}} next. This resulted in a range of tests including full-scale box loading tests in which lime piles were installed in clay samples, model <b>scale</b> <b>lime</b> pile tests and soil element tests. The stabilising mechanisms that have been established by the laboratory study are: generation of negative pore water pressure, overconsolidation of the shear zone, clay dehydration, pile strength and increased strength of stabilised clay due to lime migration. These mechanisms combine to improve any particular clay slope containing one or more shear zones. Three field trials were conducted. A small-scale trial was carried out on a canal cutting and provided useful data regarding pore water pressure changes and installation processes. Quantitative data produced by the laboratory study, were used to design two further trials. One trial treated a 30 m stretch of failing slope using a single 'Minuteman' rig (small and lightweight plant). Quicklime was 'poured' into open holes and compacted by the drill operators. Work was complete within two weeks. The third trial, again sited on a canal cutting, was carried out using a much larger rig. One hundred and fifty 200 mm diameter piles were constructed to a depth of 3 metres within a two week period. Monitoring of pore water pressures on both sites is still occurring on a regular basis. Excavation of sections of both trials at some future date will provide additional data on stabilising mechanisms. The research has considerably extended the understanding of the mechanisms controlling lime pile stabilisation, particularly when applied to failing slopes in British soils. Areas where further research would improve this understanding have been highlighted and in some cases work is already underway...|$|R

The current interpretation of the working principle is that the magnetic field interferes with crystal nucleation and growth processes resulting in formation of less adherent forms of calcium carbonate.

The application of the magnetohydrodynamic force on the water caused pronounced fragmentation of the natural suspended particles. This formation of suspended nanoparticles provides solution borne nucleation centers for crystallization of calcium carbonate thus preventing limestone deposition on the macroscopic surfaces.

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{perception}} and attention {{that emphasizes the}} relational nature o { perceptual invariants is developed {{within the context of}} auditory pattern research. The theory is divided into two parts. The first part, addresses world pattern structure; the second describes interaction of organisms with pattern structure. Tn the former, world patterns arc subjectively represented as nested relations within a multidimensional space defined by pilch, loudncss, and time. But dependency of these defining dimensions means that a pattern's <b>lime</b> <b>scale</b> determines the serial integrity of its pitch/loudness structure. Second, the theory proposes a time scale for living things that is manifest in graded perceptual rhythms. These rhythms can be synchronized to corresponding nested time zones within world pattern structure. Related assumptions about the deployment of physical energy across time zones and cognitive locations of perceptual rhythms lead to a simple, but general, attentional theory. Theoretical support, found in research with tone patterns, speech, and sequences of noise is died in a final section. Beyond this focal research, the theory offers a general framework for understanding diverse phenomena thai range from speech perception and aphasia to sleep, growth, and time eslimation. The ideas presented in this paper are the foundation for a new way to understand human perception and memory. They are developed within the context of research with auditory patterns, but the general approach has implications for man} ' other areas of inquiry. Nevertheless, their most immediate relevance is to research and theory in speech and auditory pattern perception.

40|$|Lime softening, chlorination, {{clarification}} and filtration {{have been}} long recognized treatment processes for beverage water specifically the {{carbonated soft drink}} (CSD) because it provides consistent water quality required for bottling plants, however these processes are becoming uneconomical and causes more problems than the benefits they offer. These processes require very large foot print, occupy large plant volume, and generate large volume of sludge which causes disposal problems. Chlorination produces trihalomethanes (THMs) and other by-products which are detrimental to health and imparts tastes to the final products. Using the newly developed submerged spiral wound ultrafiltration membranes in conjunction with lime softening may replace the conventional lime softening, clarification and filtration processes. This research was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating immersed ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with lime softening. The objectives {{of this research was}} to achieve the water quality required by the CSD bottlers; determine the relationships of operating parameters such as pH and membrane flux with trans-membrane pressure (TMP), and membrane permeability; determine the optimum dosage of lime; evaluate the operating parameters as basis for the design and construction of the full scale plant; and predict the membrane cleaning intervals. A pilot unit consisting of lime reactor and UF system was designed and built for this research. The pilot unit was operated at various pH ranging from 7. 3 to 11. 2 and at membrane flux rates of 15, 30 and 45 gfd. The pilot unit was also operated at the CSD bottler’s operating conditions which is pH 9. 8 at flux of 30 gfd. The pilot unit operated for a total of 1800 hours. The raw water source was from city water supply. The filtrate from the pilot unit achieved alkalinity reduction to 20 to 30 mg/L preferred by CSD bottlers, with lime dosage close to the calculated value. The filtrate turbidity during the test was consistently within 0. 4 to 0. 5 NTU. The TMP values obtained during the test ranges from 0. 1 to 2. 5 psi, while the permeability values ranges from 18. 19 to 29. 6 gfd/psi. The increase in flux results to corresponding increase in TMP, and increase in operating pH, increases the rate of TMP. Permeability decreases with increasing operating pH. The TOC reduction ranges from 2. 6 % to 15. 8 % with increasing operating pH. No scaling of the UF membranes was observed during the test. Thirty days UF membrane cleaning interval was predicted.
