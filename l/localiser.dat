5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was {{nearing the end of}} the runway, the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe {{light at the end of}} the runway as well as an antenna on the <b>localiser,</b> which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} from key destinations, {{the length of}} runway available, {{and the type of}} aircraft available in the region dictate that air services to St Helena must operate to the requirements of extended twin engine operations (ETOPS) which implies the provision of an instrument approach system based on an off-set instrument landing system <b>localiser</b> (ILS LLZ).|$|E
500|$|The then-Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel {{said that}} the {{aircraft}} was following an Instrument landing system (ILS) approach for landing on the newer, longer, runway, which was commissioned in 2006. The pilot reported to ATC that it was 'established' on an ILS approach about [...] from touchdown; landing clearance was then given at [...] from touchdown. The aeroplane concluded its ILS approach on runway 24, touching down [...] {{from the start of}} the runway, leaving [...] in which to stop. It overran the runway and ploughed through a [...] sand arrestor bed which did not stop it. As the aircraft passed the arrestor bed, its starboard wing collided with the concrete socket of the ILS <b>localiser</b> antenna; it finally plunged over the edge of the table-top about [...] beyond the end of the runway and down the steep hillside coming to a stop [...] metres past the top of the slope.|$|E
50|$|Work on Virtaal {{began in}} 2007 {{with an initial}} 0.1 release made to {{a small number of}} open source <b>localisers.</b> Version 0.2, {{released}} in October 2008, became the first official release.|$|R
30|$|Leak noise <b>localisers</b> and leak noise correlators are {{listening}} devices which use accelerometers to sense leak-induced sounds or vibrations caused by water escaping from a pressurized pipe. These devices are {{suited for the}} network in Singapore as metal pipes easily transmit water leak sounds (Hamilton & Charalambous 2013). Leak noise correlators are more sensitive than <b>localisers,</b> as {{they are able to}} automatically pinpoint leak locations based on parameters like pipe size, distance and pipe material. However, due to the sound propagation theory, these methods are only accurate for small diameter water mains; preferably 300  mm mains and below. In addition, the range of the sensors is limited to 250  m.|$|R
40|$|As {{researchers}} in web localisation, web accessibility and controlled-language (CL) software, we have noticed {{a gap in}} the way the three can be brought together in mutually advantageous ways. Localisation in general has shown little awareness of accessibility matters. The different accessibility checkers that are available are seldom used by <b>localisers</b> and web accessibility regulatory bodies and assessment tools have traditionally been very vague about language-related requirements. In this paper, we explore a linguistic approach based on semiotics and communicative value to help <b>localisers</b> analyse the accessibility needs of web content (and, in particular, nonverbal elements such as images) by means of an evaluation methodology based on controlled-language rules integrated in a content authoring tool...|$|R
2500|$|Subsequently, the {{aircraft}} hit a strobe {{light at the}} end of the runway and continued to climb with difficulties. At [...] beyond the end of the runway, the landing gear hit and damaged the [...] high <b>localiser</b> antenna array operated by Airservices Australia.

It was also reported that after clearing the airport perimeter, the aircraft cleared a small brick building by only [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{doors closed}} at 15:58 and at 16:00 Key {{requested}} pushback. At 16:03 BE 548 was cleared to taxi to the holding point {{adjacent to the}} start of Runway 27 Right. During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the [...] "Dover One Standard Instrument Departure". This Standard Instrument Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System <b>localiser</b> and middle marker beacon of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Captain Nowroz's {{decision}} to approach Gatwick {{with a view}} to landing there presented [...] "no undue risk" [...] and did not cause the accident. Instead, the cause was found to be a series of changes to speed, power and flap angle settings which were not in accordance with the airline's operating procedures and which took place in the last [...] of the approach. At 0128, the aircraft picked up the ILS <b>localiser</b> beam, and the flaps were lowered in three stages as the aircraft's speed reduced. Soon afterwards, as it approached the ILS glideslope beam, its height and speed were reduced further and the undercarriage was extended. Then the Captain saw a light which he mistook for one {{at the far end of}} the runway—it was actually on a hill beyond the airport—and the [...] "stabiliser out of trim" [...] warning light came on. This had been faulty earlier in the flight, and the Captain disengaged the autopilot and the automatic glideslope tracker. At 0133, the flap angle was increased; the aircraft then began to fall below the approach slope and was travelling faster than the crew thought. Only when it reached a height of [...] was an attempt made to gain height, but this happened too late.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{among the}} main fractions of human plasma lipoproteins {{of a number}} of porphyrins with different tumour localising ability has been determined by means of ultracentrifugation. A main trend is that the fraction of the dyes that are bound to low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases, and the fraction bound to HSA decreases with decreasing polarity of the dyes. An asymmetric charge distribution, such as in TPPS 2 a, favours LDL-binding more than expected on the basis of lipophilicity. No correlation between the known tumour localising ability of the drugs tested in the present work and their relative affinity for LDL was found. One of the best tumour <b>localisers</b> reported in the literature, TPPS 4, hardly binds to LDL, while Hp and Pp, which are commonly considered inefficient tumour <b>localisers,</b> do have a significant affinity for LDL. On the other hand, the LDL binding capacity for a drug is suggested to be a good index for cellular uptake. Such an index does not necessarily imply that the actual uptake occurs by the LDL pathway...|$|R

5000|$|The lateral {{guidance}} from the ILS <b>localiser</b> would however be usable {{right to the}} end of the landing roll, and hence is used to feed the rudder channel of the autopilot after touchdown. As aircraft approached the transmitter its speed is obviously reducing and rudder effectiveness diminishes, compensating to some extent for the increased sensitivity of the transmitted signal. More significantly however it means the safety of the aircraft is still dependent on the ILS during rollout. Furthermore, as it taxis off the runway and down any parallel taxiway, it itself acts a reflector and can interfere with the <b>localiser</b> signal. This means that it can affect the safety of any following aircraft still using the <b>localiser.</b> As a result, such aircraft cannot be allowed to rely on that signal until the first aircraft is well clear of the runway and the [...] "Cat. 3 protected area".|$|E
40|$|The {{localisation}} {{process has}} generally been regarded as a practice implemented after the web development cycle, rather than during the web development cycle as a simultaneous and complementary process. In this regard, ‘accessibilisation’ is usually predefined and carried out by non-translation/non-localisation experts during the preliminary phases of web design. This contribution focuses on how complementing localisation expertise with web accessibility (WA) know-how would provide professional <b>localisers</b> with greater communication and technical skills, which, in turn, would help them to achieve a degree of accessibility in the target product comparable with the degree of accessibility achieved in the source product. In order to prove this hypothesis, this contribution introduces a pilot study that investigates the localisation of two web pages – one accessible, one not accessible – {{with the help of}} three <b>localisers.</b> The comparative analysis is based on the localisers’ knowledge of web accessibility. The results are discussed in terms of web content understandability, of both the source web page (in English) and the target web page (in Spanish) ...|$|R
40|$|Acceptance on {{international}} markets {{is an important}} selling proposition for software products and a key to new markets. The adaptation of software products for specific markets is called software localisation. Practitioner reports and research suggests that activities of developers and translators do not mesh seamlessly, leading to problems such as disproportionate cost, lack of quality, and delayed product release. Yet, there is little research on localisation as a comprehensive activity and its human factors. This thesis examines how software localisation is handled in practice, how the localisation process is integrated into development, and how software developers and <b>localisers</b> work individually and collaboratively {{on international}} software. The research aims to understand how localisation issues around the above-mentioned classifications of cost, quality and time issues are caused. Qualitative and quantitative data is gathered through semi-structured interviews and an online survey. The interviews focused on the individual experiences of localisation and development professionals {{in a range of}} relevant roles. The online survey measured cultural competence, attitude towards and self-efficacy in localisation, and properties of localisation projects. Interviews were conducted and analysed following Straussian Grounded Theory. The survey was statistically analysed to test a number of hypotheses regarding differences between <b>localisers</b> and developers, as well as relationships between project properties and software quality. Results suggest gaps in knowledge, procedure and motivation between developers and translators, as well as a lack of cross-disciplinary knowledge and coordination. Further, a grounded theory of interdisciplinary collaboration in software localisation explains how collaboration strategies and conflicts reciprocally affect each other and are affected by external influences. A number of statistically significant differences between developers and <b>localisers</b> and the relevance of certain project properties to localisation were confirmed. The findings give new insights into interdisciplinary issues in the development of international software and suggest new ways to handle interdisciplinary collaboration in general...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of the Internet, access to {{information}} knows no boundaries. The Web is home to a complex array of (hyper) texts and multimedia content that are easy to interact with when a computer screen and a mouse are available. Nevertheless, when digital information can be only accessed if transformed into audio output, interaction becomes troublesome. Blind users, who rely on assistive technologies to perceive the Web, experience numerous challenges when accessing visual content, such as images. Web accessibility guidelines prescribe that images must be complemented with an appropriate description, that will act as a textual replacement when they cannot be displayed (Caldwell et al. 2008). Yet, studies have demonstrated that these text alternatives are often missing and that, when present, they are not correctly implemented (Hanson and Richards 2013). In the context of the multilingual Web, image accessibility heavily depends on the web <b>localiser's</b> ability to identify image text alternatives as translatable elements within an HTML document, and to effectively assess their appropriateness. Accomplishing these two steps is key to deliver a fully functional target web product. While scholars have already pointed to web accessibility as a component of web localisation quality (Jiménez-Crespo 2013), there remains a paucity of empirical evidence on how it is addressed during a localisation task. This paper presents the results of an image accessibility experiment involving 28 <b>localisers</b> with and without previous knowledge on the matter. Participants were requested to localise a website comprising 130 images, with and without the help of accessibility evaluation tools. Findings indicate that the appropriateness of localised text alternatives, which was assessed by seven blind users, varies significantly depending on the tools used and the <b>localiser's</b> level of accessibility awareness. This suggest an urgent need for localisation professionals to join the call for a more inclusive Web for all...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the last}} two decades, the {{localisation}} industry has witnessed and benefited from not only the improvement of translation technologies, but also the continued growth of digital content. The World Wide Web has turned into multilingualism’s main ally and the ethos of access to information online has been expanded to all users, regardless of their language, culture or functional diversity. The rationale behind making the Web accessible has been studied from multiple perspectives, but {{little research has been}} devoted to understand how web <b>localisers</b> could contribute to a higher degree of accessibility in the multilingual web. However, a recent study illustrates that web accessibility experts start to show their support on the matter. Within such research framework, a series of seminars on web accessibility were thus conducted both for undergraduate and graduate translation students enrolled in the Localisation and Project Management courses of two European universities. Seminars included theoretical presentations and an accessibility-oriented localization exercise, preceded and followed by task-related questionnaires. The relevance of acquiring web accessibility knowledge and know-how was generally welcomed by all participants, who showed a high level of interest and motivation during the seminars, and highlighted the need of a more comprehensive programme on the subject. By incorporating accessibility into the localisation curriculum, we are improving the chances for a broader participation of <b>localisers</b> in the whole web development cycle and reinforcing their technological competences, while contributing to the universal goal of access to information for all...|$|R

30|$|Identification of LSTV and {{accurate}} numeric identification of vertebral segments on conventional lumbar radiographs or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) are essential to ensure that interventional procedures or surgery are performed at the intended level [19]. However, establishing whether an LSTV is a lumbarised S 1 or a sacralised L 5 on MRI alone can be problematic. Conventional spine radiographs are often unavailable {{at the time of}} imaging, and cervicothoracic <b>localisers</b> may not be routinely obtained. Konin et al. [18] reported that radiographs of the entire spine allowed the radiologist not only to count from C 2 inferiorly but also to differentiate hypoplastic ribs from lumbar transverse processes. This approach allows accurate counting of thoracic segments, correct identification of the L 1 vertebral body and correct numeric assignment of the LSTV. They also reported that patients undergoing lumbar spinal MRI commonly had radiographs of the lumbar spine alone, rather than of the entire spine. Correct enumeration was often achieved in these cases, but there remained cases in which the presence of thoracolumbar transitions as well as segmentation anomalies complicated evaluation [18].|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} Molé, a mobile organic localisation engine. Unlike previous work on crowdsourced WiFi positioning, Molé uses a hierarchical name space. By not relying on a map and by being more strict than uninterpreted names for places, Molé aims for a more flexible and scalable point in the design space of localisation systems. Molé employs several new techniques, including a new statistical positioning algorithm to differentiate between neighboring places, a motion detector to reduce update lag, and a scalable “cloud”-based fingerprint distribution system. Molé’s localisation algorithm, called Maximum Overlap (mao), accounts for temporal variations in a place’s fingerprint in a principled manner. It also allows for aggregation of fingerprints from many users and is compact enough for on-device storage. We show through end-to-end experiments in two deployments thatmao is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art Bayesian-based <b>localisers.</b> We also show that non-experts can use Molé to quickly survey a building, enabling room-grained location-based services for themselves and others.
