5|$|Chaulmoogra oil, {{from the}} seeds of Hydnocarpus wightiana, used for many centuries, {{internally}} and externally, to treat <b>leprosy.</b> Also used to treat secondary syphilis, rheumatism, scrofula, and in phthisis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} <b>leprosy,</b> some viewers voiced concerns that Colombia was frowned upon by the world because of the film, and that it resulted in the decrease {{of the price of}} Colombian coffee abroad.|$|E
5|$|In Quinnimont, West Virginia, {{a team of}} {{soldiers}} arrives at an abandoned <b>leprosy</b> research compound, rounding {{up most of the}} patients. One patient, Escalante, hides beneath a trapdoor during the arrival and follows the group to a secluded field nearby. He watches as the soldiers shoot the other patients, including apparent alien-human hybrids, into a mass grave.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although <b>leprosy</b> is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have <b>leprosy,</b> he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church is {{the largest}} non-government {{provider}} of education and medical services in the world. In 2010, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said that the Church manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with <b>leprosy.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela. Given the theme of <b>leprosy,</b> the film was criticized by some who believed {{it would have a}} negative impact on the image of Colombia. Despite parts of the film not surviving, the Fundación Patrimonio Fílmico Colombiano have retained a 22 minute 45 second excerpt from the film.|$|E
5|$|Luis Walter Alvarez {{was born}} in San Francisco on June 13, 1911, the second child and oldest son of Walter C. Alvarez, a physician, and his wife Harriet née Smyth, and a {{grandson}} of Luis F. Álvarez, a physician who lived {{for a time in}} Spain, then Cuba, and finally the United States, who found a better method for diagnosing macular <b>leprosy.</b> He had an older sister, Gladys, a younger brother, Bob, and a younger sister, Bernice. His aunt, Mabel Alvarez, was a California artist specializing in oil painting.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and <b>leprosy.</b> The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|Traditional beliefs {{regarding}} {{slow lorises}} {{have been part}} of the folklore of Southeast Asia for at least several hundred years. Their remains are buried under houses and roads to bring good luck, and every part of their body is used in traditional medicine to make products ranging from love potions to unproven cures for cancer, <b>leprosy,</b> epilepsy, and sexually transmitted diseases. The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives.|$|E
5|$|During King Kalākaua's {{world tour}} in 1881, Liliʻuokalani served as Regent in his absence. It {{was during this}} regency that Liliʻuokalani visited the leper {{settlement}} at Kalaupapa on Molokaʻi in September. She was too overcome to speak and John Makini Kapena, one of her brother's minister, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, {{in the name of}} her brother, Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects. She also convinced the governmental board of health to set aside land for a <b>leprosy</b> hospital at Kakaʻako. She made a second visit to the settlement with Queen Kapiolani in 1884.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, <b>leprosy</b> and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the Bengal slow loris, every part—including the brain, urine, and skin—is used in {{traditional}} medicine in order to heal wounds and rheumatism. With the Sunda slow loris, people trade the skin, feet, skeletons, and skulls. The fur is reported to heal wounds, the flesh to cure epilepsy, eyes are used in love potions, and the meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems. The pygmy slow loris is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make bone glue of monkey, a medicine used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow loris bones is considered good luck and the meat is sometimes thought to cure <b>leprosy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Judah {{returns to}} his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her {{arranged}} marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted <b>leprosy</b> in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Juda's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{models of}} {{naturally}} occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals {{have a natural}} propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog suffer from narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are {{the primary source of}} bacilli used in <b>leprosy</b> vaccines.|$|E
5|$|The League's health {{organisation}} {{had three}} bodies: the Health Bureau, containing permanent {{officials of the}} League; the General Advisory Council or Conference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health Committee. The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee {{the operation of the}} League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the Council. This body focused on ending <b>leprosy,</b> malaria, and yellow fever, the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent typhus epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, <b>leprosy</b> and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous <b>leprosy.</b> Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa <b>Leprosy</b> Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E
5|$|Henry IV {{was plagued}} with {{financial}} problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions and declining healthincluding <b>leprosy</b> and epilepsy. The Percy {{family had been}} some of Henry's leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely at their own expense, but revolted {{in the face of}} lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. Henry Percy (Hotspur) was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Hotspur's father Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, supported the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated. Henry had Scrope executed in an act comparable to the murder of another ArchbishopThomas Becket by men loyal to Henry II. This would probably have led to Henry's excommunication but the church {{was in the midst of}} the Western Schism, with competing popes keen on Henry's support; it protested but took no action. In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr's widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of Harlech Castle in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.|$|E
5|$|Raynald {{was held}} in prison until 1176. After his release for a large ransom, he {{did not return to}} Antioch, because his wife had {{meanwhile}} died. He married Stephanie of Milly, the wealthy heiress of Oultrejordain. Since Baldwin IV of Jerusalem also granted Hebron to him, Raynald was one of the wealthiest barons of the realm. He controlled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. Baldwin, who suffered from <b>leprosy,</b> made him regent in 1177. Raynald led the crusader army that defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard. He was the only Christian leader to pursue an offensive policy against Saladin, making plundering raids against the caravans travelling near his domains. He built a fleet of five ships which plundered the coast of the Red Sea, threatening the route of the Muslim pilgrims towards Mecca in early 1183. Saladin pledged that he would never forgive Raynald.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, <b>leprosy,</b> and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|The next scene {{shows the}} {{sarcophagus}} with Constantina, {{the daughter of}} the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown. She has been afflicted with <b>leprosy,</b> and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there. The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").|$|E
5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for <b>leprosy</b> were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E
5|$|Madhavan has lent {{his support}} for the Chennai-based charity, The Banyan, and {{appeared}} in the charity musical Netru, Indru, Naalai directed by Mani Ratnam for the cause. He appeared as a guest cook and newly launched restaurant in Chennai and cooked dosas for auction for the charity, helping raise forty five thousand rupees. He {{has been a part of}} an AIDS awareness programme initiated by Richard Gere in India and helped advertise the A Time for Heroes campaign appearing in a short film. Similarly Madhavan featured in a four-minute film produced by Agaram Foundation, Herova? Zerova?, campaigning for educational awareness alongside Suriya, Vijay and Jyothika. In 2010, along with his cast and crew from 3 Idiots, he helped raise Rs. 2.5million for the renovation of the school in Leh, which was damaged by flash floods. Madhavan laid bricks and tiles at the London Business School in July 2011, building a symbolic house to represent the 100,000 houses that will be built in India by 2015 as a part of Habitat for Humanity's campaign to improve substandard houses in India. During the 2015 South Indian floods, Madhavan worked alongside other Indian actors in coordinating the relief efforts. In 2016, Lepra India signed him to work as a goodwill ambassador in helping promote action against <b>leprosy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, <b>leprosy,</b> and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of <b>leprosy</b> affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E
25|$|Norway was the {{location}} of a progressive stance on <b>leprosy</b> tracking and treatment and played an influential role in European understanding of the disease. In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first <b>leprosy</b> survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national <b>leprosy</b> registry to study the causes of <b>leprosy</b> and for tracking of the rate of infection.|$|E
25|$|British India {{enacted the}} <b>Leprosy</b> Act of 1898 which {{institutionalized}} those affected and segregated them by gender to prevent reproduction. The Act {{was difficult to}} enforce but was repealed in 1983 only after MDT therapy had become widely available. In 1983, the National <b>Leprosy</b> Elimination Programme, previously the National <b>Leprosy</b> Control Programme, changed its methods from surveillance {{to the treatment of}} people with <b>leprosy.</b> India still accounts for over half of the global disease burden.|$|E
25|$|According to a <b>leprosy</b> survey {{carried out}} in Okinawa Islands, it is {{reported}} that Izena Island has the largest incidence of <b>leprosy</b> and morbidity.|$|E
25|$|Written {{accounts}} of <b>leprosy</b> date back thousands of years. Various skin diseases translated as <b>leprosy</b> {{appear in the}} ancient Indian text, the Atharava Veda, as early as 2000 BC. Another Indian text, the Laws of Manu (1500 BC), prohibited contact with those infected with the disease and made marriage to a person infected with <b>leprosy</b> punishable.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>leprosy</b> {{research}} throughout Europe {{was conducted}} by Norwegian scientists Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Carl Wilhelm Boeck. Their work resulted {{in the establishment of}} the National <b>Leprosy</b> Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of <b>leprosy</b> transmission was hereditary. This stance was influential in advocating for the isolation of those infected by gender to prevent reproduction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leprosy</b> is curable with a {{treatment}} known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary <b>leprosy</b> {{is with the}} medications dapsone and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary <b>leprosy</b> consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of <b>leprosy</b> was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of <b>leprosy.</b> About 200 cases are reported {{per year in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leprosy</b> {{was once}} {{believed}} to be highly contagious and was treated with mercury—as was syphilis, which was first described in 1530. Many early cases thought to be <b>leprosy</b> could actually have been syphilis.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to {{a patient}} critically ill with <b>leprosy.</b> The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of <b>leprosy.</b> This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours {{and was able to}} get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in <b>leprosy</b> soon followed.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{perception}} {{that people with}} <b>leprosy</b> were unclean may be connected to a passage from Leviticus 13: 44-46, among others. Judeo-Christian belief, for some, held that <b>leprosy</b> was of moral consequence, and, as in many societies, early Christians believed that those affected by <b>leprosy</b> were being punished by God for sinful behavior. Moral associations have persisted throughout history. Pope Gregory the Great (540-604) and Isidor of Seville (560-636) considered people with the disease to be heretics.|$|E
25|$|Browne {{returned}} to England 1965 {{and used his}} vast knowledge and research of <b>leprosy</b> to consult for the World Health Organization, International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Association (ILEP), various Christian Medical associations, Mother Teresa's <b>leprosy</b> hospital in Calcutta, and the International Albert Schweitzer Fellowship.|$|E
