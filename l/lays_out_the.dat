5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight years in office, with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so he lifts up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the burh walls is recorded in a charter witnessed by King Alfred, which <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> responsibilities of the various churchmen and nobles involved, and notes that the upkeep of the walls would be paid for out of a share of taxes on a new market and on the new streets. The local lords took responsibility for building the burh wall, which unusually for the period was not built on royal lands. During the 10th century, the documents on the burh suggest that the aristocratic thegns living around Worcester also owned and maintained buildings within the walls; Creighton and Higham suggest that these may {{have been linked to}} their responsibilities for defending the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets {{over the course of the}} year. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.|$|E

25|$|The LOE prescribes {{that the}} Director of a LLC may be sued by {{shareholders}} should he fail to perform his obligations and duties. In contrast, in a SC, {{there are no}} such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.|$|E
25|$|The Hippocratic Corpus, popularly {{attributed}} {{to an ancient}} Greek practitioner known as Hippocrates, <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> basic approach to health care. Greek philosophers viewed the human body as a system that reflects the workings of nature and Hippocrates applied this belief to medicine. The body, {{as a reflection of}} natural forces, contained four elemental properties expressed to the Greeks as the four humors. The humors represented fire, air, earth and water through the properties of hot, cold, dry and moist, respectively. Health in the human body relied on keeping these humors in balance within each person.|$|E

As {{a matter of the}} right to privacy and of gender equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference.

25|$|In {{an article}} for the Daily Mail, Nawaz notes how self-segregation has created Muslim {{communities}} in London where third-generation teenagers are growing up without having any non-Muslim friends, or friends from the opposite sex. He notes how their lives revolve around faith schools, mosque, Islamic extracurricular activities and cultural events involving members of the Muslim community only. Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma. On an individual level, Nawaz maps a person's path to radicalisation with four key stages: grievances, identity crisis, charismatic recruiter and ideology. It begins {{with a sense of}} real or perceived grievances, which leads to an identity crisis. This condition is then capitalised on by a recruiter from an organisation who <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ideology as a solution to that individual's alienation.|$|E
25|$|Infuriated at {{the murderer}} for killing {{someone who was}} enjoying his {{hospitality}} and skeptical of Assa's guilt, Wolfe determines to identify the true culprit. He, along with Archie and Saul Panzer, travels to the offices of LBA and inspects a display of products from their clients, discovering a bottle of cyanide that he suspects was used to murder Assa; this confirms in Wolfe's mind the guilt {{of one of the}} executives. Confronting Burr, O'Garro and Hansen, Wolfe <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> facts of the case and accuses Burr of murdering both Dahlmann and Assa. Burr is the only man who had clear means and opportunity, and Wolfe speculates that he was driven to murder Dahlmann out of jealousy and fear over Dahlmann's skills eclipsing and threatening his position. Assa discovered the wallet that Burr stole from Dahlmann to cover his tracks, and Burr murdered him to silence him. When Burr tries to throw guilt on O'Garro, O'Garro reveals that Wolfe is correct. Burr is convicted of murder, but the remaining LBA executives challenge Wolfe's fee, arguing that as the thief and murderer Burr presumably exposed himself when he sent out the letters containing the final answers. In response, Wolfe reveals in confidence that he will be adding onto his bill the price of a used typewriter that has been disposed of in the East River, implying that he was in fact responsible for sending out the letters and saving them from humiliation after all.|$|E
25|$|In Jared Diamond's {{groundbreaking}} Guns, Germs, and Steel, he <b>lays</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> basic {{arguments for}} Environmental determinism - that environments and geography determine the political institutions {{of a certain}} region. Starting from the same attempt to explain why Eurasian civilizations have outlived other civilizations that used {{to exist in the}} world, Diamond looks at the geographical differences among different civilizations and the agricultural practices that have arisen from those differences. For example, because of the latitudinal differences between the Eurasian continent and American/African continents—the Eurasian continent has a large longitudinal span while the American/African continents are longitudinally narrow—it is easier for inhabitants of the Eurasian continent to spread the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals like wheat, cows and horses. On the other hand, for African and American continents, because of the wide latitudinal differences of different regions, it is hard for the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals to spread. Because of this difference, people on Eurasian continent are more likely to develop stronger immune systems and thus their civilizations are more likely to survive. However, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, the theory is incapable of explaining the {{gap between rich and poor}} countries after 1500. It is also powerless in explaining the difference of economic growth between two places with similar or same geographic conditions, like Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona, North Korea and South Korea and East Germany and West Germany. In comparison, according to the book, geographical factors do not have as strong an explanatory power as institutional factors. Especially in the modern age when advanced technology is widely available, the reason why Equatorial Guinea or Sierra Leone still suffer from diseases like Malaria is not because of the weather, but because of the poor institutions underlying those states.|$|E
