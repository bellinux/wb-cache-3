40|$|Secret {{handshake}} {{allows a}} group of authorized users to establish a shared secret key {{and at the same}} time authenticate each other anonymously. A straightforward approach to design an unlinkable secret handshake protocol is to use either <b>long-term</b> <b>certificate</b> or one-time certificate provided by a trusted authority. However, how to detect the misusing of certificates by an insider adversary is a challenging security issue when using those approaches for unlinkable secret handshake. In this paper, we propose a novel k-time authenticated secret handshake (k-ASH) protocol where each authorized user is only allowed to use the credential for k times. We formalize security models, including session key security and anonymity, for k-ASH, and prove the security of the proposed protocol under some computational problems which are proved hard in the generic bilinear group model. The proposed protocol also achieved public traceability property if a user misuses the k-time credential...|$|E
40|$|This paper initiates a {{study of}} {{accountable}} certificate management methods, necessary to support long-term authenticity of digital documents. Our main contribution is a model for accountable certificate management, where clients receive attestations confirming inclusion/removal of their certificates from the database of valid certificates. We explain why accountability depends on {{the inability of the}} third parties to create contradictory attestations. After that we define an undeniable attester as a primitive that provides efficient attestation creation, publishing and verification, so that it is intractable to create contradictory attestations. We introduce authenticated search trees and build an efficient undeniable attester upon them. The proposed system is the first accountable <b>long-term</b> <b>certificate</b> management system. Moreover, authenticated search trees can be used in many security-critical applications instead of the (sorted) hash trees to reduce trust in the authorities, without decrease in efficiency. Therefore, the undeniable attester promises looks like a very useful cryptographic primitive {{with a wide range of}} applications.

40|$|The idea of {{vehicular}} {{communication systems}} could bring more safety, immunity and assurance in driving while it poses {{a variety of}} applications in traffic efficiency, driver assistance, environmental hazards, road conditions and infotainment. The aim is to make driving safer and to facilitate driving to the full extent, even on dangerous roads. However, having effective and robust operations within the VC system needs an infrastructure to handle threats, faults, illegitimate activities and unexpected incidents. Message authentication, integrity, non-repudiation and privacy within such a system are considered as the most controversial issues from security perspective. The idea is to protect privacy not only from legal point of view, but also from technical perspective {{in terms of using}} privacy enhancing technologies. To provide security within such a system, the idea of Public Key Infrastructure is considered as a promising solution. Using long-term certificates does reveal the real identity of the owner. Since users’ privacy is considered as the main security requirement in the VC system, standard certificates (X. 509) and normal PKI cannot be used within a VC network. There are some functionalities and features for vehicular communication systems that do not exist in standard PKI. As a result, using pseudonym certificates to perform transactions within the VC system is a solution. In this report, a vehicular public key infrastructure, called VPKI, is proposed. OpenCA is used as the PKI, equipped with Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), <b>Long-Term</b> <b>Certificate</b> Authority (LTCA) and Pseudonym Resolution Authority (PRA). These authorities are certified by the RCA and they have privileges to perform their tasks. LTCA is responsible for issuing long-term certificates while PCA is responsible for issuing pseudonym certificates. PRA is the authority to perform pseudonym resolution to identify the real identity of a pseudonym certificate. When it comes to CRL, PCA is the responsible authority to determine revoked pseudonym certificates {{in order to keep the}} system secure. Three protocols are then proposed to obtain pseudonym certificates, latest version of pseudonym CRL as well as performing pseudonym resolution. Obtaining pseudonym certificates is done in two phases. Firstly, each vehicle sends a request to LTCA to get a valid token. In the second step, the token is used by PCA to issue pseudonym certificates...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{one of the}} first estimates of the returns to different types of community college credentials [...] short-term <b>certificates,</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>certificates,</b> and associate degrees [...] across different fields of study. We exploit a rich dataset that includes matched, longitudinal college transcripts and Unemployment Insurance records for students who entered a Washington State community college in 2001 - 2002, and we use an individual fixed effects identification strategy to control for both observed and unobserved student characteristics that are time invariant. We find that earning an associate degree leads to positive increases in wages in almost every field (compared with earning some credits but not obtaining a credential), but that the magnitude of these effects varies greatly by field. For example, while earning an associate degree in the humanities and social sciences increases earnings by 5 percent for women, earning an associate degree in nursing increases women's earnings by 37 percent. Further, our analysis by field of study reveals that the returns to associate degrees are higher than the returns to <b>long-term</b> and short-term <b>certificates</b> within almost every field, but that a larger proportion of <b>long-term</b> <b>certificates</b> tend to be offered in high-return fields. Our findings also suggest that, unlike associate degrees and <b>long-term</b> <b>certificates,</b> short-term certificates have little or no effect on wages in most fields of study when compared with earning some credits and leaving college without a credential. Finally, the impact of credential receipt on the probability of employment and on hours worked per week is at least as significant in magnitude as the impact on wages. This suggests that part of the returns to earnings estimated in previous literature results from the greater employability of students who earn a credential rather than from increases in human capital as measured by wages...|$|R

50|$|An {{attacker}} who steals {{a certificate}} authority's private keys {{is able to}} forge certificates {{as if they were}} CA, without needed ongoing access to the CA's systems. Key theft is therefore one of the main risks certificate authorities defend against. Publicly trusted CAs almost always store their keys on a hardware security module (HSM), which allows them to sign certificates with a key, but generally prevent extraction of that key with both physical and software controls. CAs typically take the further precaution of keeping the key for their <b>long-term</b> root <b>certificates</b> in an HSM that is kept offline, except when it is needed to sign shorter-lived intermediate certificates. The intermediate certificates, stored in an online HSM, can do the day-to-day work of signing end-entity certificates and keeping revocation information up to date.|$|R
40|$|Most {{students}} who enter {{a community college}} with the stated intention of attaining a credential or transferring to a four-year university leave without accomplishing either of those goals (National Center for Education Statistics, 2011). This dissertation attempts {{to contribute to the}} growing economic literature that seeks to understand the conditions and policies that can positively influence community college students' academic and labor market success. In the first essay, I examine the effectiveness of remediation for {{students who}} are identified to have the lowest skills in mathematics. Descriptively, while students assigned to remediation tend to have poor outcomes overall, students assigned to the lowest levels of remedial math have the worst outcomes of all students. I use data from the state of Virginia's 2004 cohort of students and use a regression discontinuity design and find that students assigned to the third lowest level of remedial math would have benefited if they had been able to skip that remedial course. In the second essay, I use administrative data to examine how working while taking classes affects community college students' academic outcomes. I use two different identification strategy: an individual fixed effects strategy that takes advantage of the quarterly nature of the data to control for unobserved and time-invariant differences among students, and an instrumental variable difference-in-differences (IV-DID) framework that takes advantage {{of the fact that there}} is an exogenous supply of retail jobs during the winter holidays. Using the IV-DID framework, I compare academic outcomes during the fall versus the winter quarter for students who are more likely to work in retail versus students who are less likely to work in retail, based on pre-enrollment association with retail jobs. I find small negative effects of working on GPA and possibly positive outcomes of working on credit accumulation. Finally, in the third essay, Madeline J. Weiss and I examine the returns to community college credentials using administrative data. Using an individual fixed effects identification strategy that compares trajectories of wages across individuals, we find positive and substantial wage returns to associate degrees and <b>long-term</b> <b>certificates</b> and no wage returns to short-term certificates, over and above wage increases for students who enrolled and earned some credits but never earned a credential or transferred. We also find that associate degrees tend to be awarded in low-returns fields, but that in almost any given field, the returns to associate degrees is higher than the returns to certificates...|$|R

Among the issues delineated are member-leader conflicts, role-suction, the creation of covert roles (deep roles), parricide, and parental fantasies relevant to leadership in action. The paper ends {{with a description of}} the author’s surging self-conflict during the last year of the training programme, maintaining that his participation in the programme led to strategic decisions that led to significant on-the-job changes. Key words: group analysis, leadership training, participant observation, IGA, Oslo In the last decade, increasing demands have been made on the competence of employees, with constant new demands in terms of top performance, individual learning and organizational change. As a consequence, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and burn-out are on the increase.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{feasibility}} of International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and to explore the distribution, including gender differences, of health problems and disabilities as reflected in <b>long-term</b> sickness absence <b>certificates.</b> Methods A total of 433 patients with long sick-listing periods, 267 women and 166 men, were included in the study. All certificates exceeding 28 days of sick-listing sent to the local office of the Swedish Social Insurance Administration of a municipality in the Stockholm area were collected during four weeks in 2004 - 2005. ICD- 10 medical diagnosis codes in the certificates were retrieved and free text information on disabilities in body function, body structure or activity and participation were coded according to ICF short version. Results In 89. 8 % of the certificates there were descriptions of disabilities that readily could be classified according to ICF. In a reliability test 123 / 131 (94 %) items of randomly chosen free text information were identically classified by two of the authors. On average 2. 4 disability categories (range 0 - 9) were found per patient; the most frequent were 'Sensation of pain' (35. 1 % of the patients), 'Emotional functions' (34. 1 %), 'Energy and drive functions' (22. 4 %), and 'Sleep functions' (16. 9 %). The dominating ICD- 10 diagnostic groups were 'Mental and behavioural disorders' (34. 4 %) and 'Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue' (32. 8 %). 'Reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders' (14. 7 %), and 'Depressive episode' (11. 5 %) were the most frequent diagnostic codes. Disabilities in mental functions and activity/participation were more commonly described among women, while disabilities related to the musculoskeletal system were more frequent among men. Conclusions Both ICD- 10 diagnoses and ICF categories were dominated by mental and musculoskeletal health problems, but there seems to be gender differences, and ICF classification as a complement to ICD- 10 could provide a better understanding of the consequences of diseases and how individual patients can cope with their health problems. ICF is feasible for secondary classifying of free text descriptions of disabilities stated in sick-leave certificates and seems to be useful as a complement to ICD- 10 for sick-listing management and research. </p...|$|R
