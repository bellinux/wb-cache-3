It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> {{to create new}} memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{congenital}} amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder. Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to produce musical sounds while sparing speech, much like aphasics lose speech selectively but can sometimes still sing. Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated dissociations between rhythm, melody, and emotional processing of music, and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.|$|E

Concerns over his father's expectations of him would continue throughout Hussain's career, as he related in his biography after retiring. After {{the loss of his}} bowling, Hussain dropped behind his contemporaries; Atherton, Ramprakash and Martin Bicknell all began to receive professional county contracts while Hussain was not being selected for representative games and England tours. Hussain switched to batting while he was still captain of Essex under-16s and moved himself up the order to get more runs and to bowl less. His batting progressed, and in that year he became the first under-16 at Forest to score 1,000 runs in a season since 1901. Hussain himself admitted that batting never came as naturally to him as leg-spin bowling. Throughout his career he batted with little left elbow and plenty of bottom hand, and backed-up with the bat in his right hand.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms of amusia are {{generally}} categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar melodies, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to read musical notation, and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes. Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to sing, write musical notation, and/or play an instrument.

2500|$|Ideational/conceptual apraxia: Patients have an {{inability}} to conceptualize a task and impaired ability to complete multistep actions. [...] Consists of {{an inability}} to select and carry out an appropriate motor program. [...] For example, the patient may complete actions in incorrect orders, such as buttering bread before putting it in the toaster, or putting on shoes before putting on socks. There is also a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects or tools. For instance, if given a screwdriver, the patient may try to write with {{it as if it}} were a pen, or try to comb his hair with a toothbrush.|$|E
2500|$|The main symptom is pain, causing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> {{and often}} stiffness. [...] "Pain" [...] is {{generally}} {{described as a}} sharp ache or a burning sensation in the associated muscles and tendons, and is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called [...] "crepitus") when the affected joint is moved or touched and people may experience muscle spasms and contractions in the tendons. Occasionally, the joints may also be filled with fluid. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.|$|E
2500|$|However, another {{theory is}} that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to make vitamin C in simians may have {{occurred}} much farther back in evolutionary history than the emergence of humans or even apes, since it evidently occurred soon after the appearance of the first primates, yet sometime after the split of early primates into the two major suborders Haplorrhini (which cannot make vitamin C) and its sister suborder of non-tarsier prosimians, the Strepsirrhini ("wet-nosed" [...] primates), which retained the ability to make vitamin C. According to molecular clock dating, these two suborder primate branches parted ways about 63 to 60 million years ago. Approximately three to five million years later (58 million years ago), only a short time afterward from an evolutionary perspective, the infraorder Tarsiiformes, whose only remaining family is that of the tarsier (Tarsiidae), branched off from the other haplorrhines. [...] Since tarsiers also cannot make vitamin C, this implies the mutation had already occurred, and thus must have occurred between these two marker points (63 to 58 million years ago).|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{their return}} to Japan, Miyazaki and the {{creative}} team worked on conceptual art and character designs. Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones. Majo no Takkyūbin, the original children's book by Kadono that the movie was based on, {{is very different from}} Miyazaki's finished film. [...] Kadono's novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on [...] "her good heart" [...] and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises. Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki losing her powers or the airship incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. However, in order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness. One such challenge is Kiki's sudden <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it. Miyazaki remarked, [...] "As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original". Kadono was unhappy with the changes that made between the book and film, {{to the point that the}} project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage. Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki, the producer of Ghibli, went to the author's home and invited her to the film's studio. After her visit to the studio, Kadono decided to let the project continue.|$|E
