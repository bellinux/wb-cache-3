5|$|A non-pegylated <b>liposomal</b> doxorubicin, called Myocet, is {{approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the <b>liposomal</b> encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through <b>liposomal</b> encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of <b>liposomal</b> drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{has gotten}} a reduced cost for <b>liposomal</b> {{amphotericin}} B at $18 a vial, but many vials may be needed for treatment {{and it must be}} kept cool.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for visceral leishmaniasis acquired in India is now Amphotericin B in its various <b>liposomal</b> preparations. In East Africa, the WHO recommended treatment is SSG (sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin) developed by Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi)in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is {{especially}} prominent {{with the use}} of anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and <b>liposomal</b> doxorubicin). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and clofarabine.|$|E
25|$|Any {{drugs that}} are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can {{potentially}} increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and <b>liposomal</b> morphine are both absolutely contraindicated, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include <b>liposomal</b> amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, <b>liposomal</b> preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E
25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, <b>liposomal</b> amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{amphotericin}} B desoxycholate (AmB: {{used since}} the 1950s {{as a primary}} agent) {{is known to be}} associated with increased drug-induced Nephrotoxicity (Renal toxicity) impairing Renal function. Other formulations have been developed such as lipid soluble formulations to mitigate such side-effects as direct proximal and distal tubular cytotoxicity. These include <b>liposomal</b> amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex such as Abelcet (brand) amphotericin B phospholipid complex also as AmBisome Intravenous, or Amphotec Intravenous (Generic; Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sul) and, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion, all shown to exhibit a decrease in nephrotoxicity. The later was not as effective in one study as amphotericin B desoxycholate which had a 50% murine morbidity rate versus zero for the AmB colloidal dispersion.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated <b>liposomal</b> doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. <b>Liposomal</b> amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum-resistant tumors, {{there are}} no high-efficacy {{chemotherapy}} options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of topotecan, pegylated <b>liposomal</b> doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases. Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, {{or it may be}} combined with <b>liposomal</b> doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, topotecan, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide. ( [...] See also Palliative care below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The cost of AmB deoxycholate in 2015, for {{a patient}} of [...] at 1mg/kg/day dosage, was {{approximately}} $63.80, compared to 5mg/kg/day of <b>liposomal</b> AmB at $1318.80. This may be a concern in resource-limited settings.|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{development}} pipeline is lacking significantly, and no novel drug targets are expected for approval {{in the next}} 5 years. In the meantime, new combination therapies, and well as improvements to existing drugs targets, are under development. [...] Single-dosage administrations of <b>liposomal</b> amphotericin B {{have been shown to}} be effective, and oral formulations are currently under development to increase access and facilitate distribution of the efficacious drug in the field.|$|E
2500|$|Honokiol is most {{commonly}} taken orally. There {{are a number}} of supplements available containing honokiol. Magnolia tea made from the bark of the tree is also a common delivery method of honokiol. Both Native Americans and Japanese medicine use tea gargles to treat toothaches and sore throats. Because honokiol is highly hydrophobic it must be dissolved in a lipid for many delivery methods. In many current animal studies the compound is [...] dissolved in a lipid emollient and delivered through intraperitoneal injection. There is ongoing work developing <b>liposomal</b> emulsions for IV delivery.|$|E
2500|$|Amphotericin B is {{the most}} potent {{antifungal}} drug available to treat mucormycosis. When given intravenously in the deoxycholate form, amphotericin B is associated with toxic side effects. For this reason, it is often replaced with <b>liposomal</b> amphotericin B, a lipid-based formulation with fewer adverse side effects. Treatment of A. variabilis infections usually involves aggressive antifungal therapy and often surgical removal of necrotic tissue. In mouse models of infection, posaconazole has shown efficacy both in vivo and in vitro. Amphotericin B may {{also be used to}} reduce fungal load. In the mouse study, both drugs decreased the amount of hyphae in infected tissues but posaconazole had better survival outcomes than amphotericin B.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin C is {{available}} in tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25mg to 1500mg per serving. The most commonly used compounds are ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. Timed release versions are available, as are formulations containing bioflavonoids such as quercetin, hesperidin, and rutin. In some countries, vitamin C as ascorbic acid crystals {{is available}} in bottles containing 300g to 1kg of powder. The bottles are usually airtight and brown or opaque {{in order to prevent}} oxidation. Vitamin C molecules can be bound to fatty acids, creating a compound described as esterified vitamin C. This is not the same process used to create a commercial product [...] "Ester-C" [...] which neutralizes ascorbic acid with calcium carbonate to create calcium ascorbate. Lastly, commercial supplements of <b>liposomal</b> vitamin C are marketed, but the bioavailability of such products is not sufficiently studied to determine any difference from other forms of vitamin C.|$|E

50|$|<b>Liposomal</b> {{daunorubicin}} (trade name DaunoXome) is a chemotherapy {{drug that}} is FDA approved to treat AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma. It is also {{commonly used to}} treat specific types of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. <b>Liposomal</b> daunorubicin is intravenously administered.
