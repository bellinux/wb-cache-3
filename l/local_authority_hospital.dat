40|$|Birthweight-specific rates can {{be useful}} for {{summarising}} stillbirth and neonatal mortality in populations but, sometimes, a single summary measure is required to compare several relatively small subpopulations. However, any particular summary has its shortcomings, and various methods have been proposed. We wished to compare mortality between <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and between <b>hospitals</b> in the Thames regions and thus required a single summary measure for each subpopulation. It was not obvious in advance which summary to use or whether a single method would work well for both <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> (a geographical unit) and hospitals. This study compared six methods of calculating a single summary, three using indirect standardisation to adjust (500 g bands, 10 -percentile bands, 10 z-score bands) and three using regression to adjust (mean birthweight, proportion < 2500 g, proportion < 1500 g). The data used were 570 016 births in the Thames Regions, broken down into its 96 <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and 65 <b>hospitals.</b> To investigate how well each adjustment had performed, we calculated the rank correlation between the crude and various adjusted mortality rates and mean birthweight, proportion < 2500 g and proportion < 1500 g. This was done separately in the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>hospitals.</b> If a method of adjustment had worked very well, these correlations should be negligible. For the <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> adjustment for proportion < 1500 g gave the lowest correlations. Adjustment for mean birthweight and 500 g-band standardisation {{did not appear to}} work so well but gave moderately low correlations. For hospitals, 500 g standardisation gave the lowest correlations. Adjustment for mean birthweight and proportion < 2500 g worked only moderately well. Percentile and z-score adjustment did not work well for <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> or <b>hospitals.</b> We conclude that several methods appear to work reasonably well for <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> whereas for <b>hospitals,</b> 500 g indirect standardisation worked best.

However, no action was taken due to the international crisis.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the process that}} led Brazilian philanthropic general hospitals to implement psychiatric units and to describe the main characteristics and therapeutic approaches of these services. Ten institutions in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, São Paulo e Santa Catarina) were assessed in 2002. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were carried out with health professionals {{who worked at the}} hospitals to collect data on service implementation process, therapeutic approaches and current situation. The interviews were audio-recorded and their content was analyzed. There was no mental hospital in the cities where the institutions were located. In five hospitals, psychiatric patients were admitted to general medical wards because there was no psychiatric unit. The therapeutic approach in six hospitals was based on psychopharmacological treatment. Due to lack of resources and more appropriate therapeutic planning, the admission of patients presenting psychomotor agitation increases resistance against psychiatric patients in general hospitals. Financial constraints regarding laboratory testing is still a challenge. There is no exchange between <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and <b>hospital</b> administrators of these institutions that are compelled to exceed the allowed number of admissions to meet the demand of neighboring cities. The need for mental health care to local populations combined with individual requests of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and psychiatrists made possible the implementation of psychiatric units in these localities. In spite of the efforts and flexibility of health professional working in these institutions, there are some obstacles to be overcome: resistance of hospital community against psychiatric admissions, financial constraints, limited professional training in mental health and the lack of a therapeutic approach that goes beyond psychopharmacological treatment alone...|$|R
40|$|The Public Administration model here {{developed}} simulates PA wage dynamics on {{the basis}} of the last realized levels and a set of economic and normative hypotheses (expected inflation, wage settlements, etc.). The narrow model dimensions do not permit sub-national forecasts; local wage dynamics, not always checked by the central government, may however vary over time and influence the general public deficit, which is a government’s competence. The likely clash between centralized constraints and decentralized dynamics is doomed to grow as a consequence of fiscal federalism and public functions decentralization. Such features are especially relevant for the National Health Service (NHS), due to its intrinsic institutional complexity, the NHS labor costs relevance and the sub-national segmentation of the operational units (<b>local</b> health <b>authorities,</b> <b>hospitals,</b> etc.). The NHS labor cost higher increments correspond to the wage settlements (1990 - 91, 1996 - 97, etc.). It is however possible to observe a background dynamic pattern - more evident in the years with no wage settlement effects (e. g. 1992 - 95) - which arises from various sources: decentralized wage bargaining, personnel seniority and promotions, professional qualifications changes, etc. Such factors affect average wages in a locally differentiated way: they can only be identified by a disaggregated data analysis.

The LUCIDE network is formed by 13 European cities along with research teams from Ottawa and Melbourne. A more detailed description of the network will be presented in chapter 3. The main aims of the network are: 1. to build up a concrete picture of how communication occurs in multilingual settings across the EU and beyond; 2. to help institutions (<b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> schools, <b>hospitals)</b> and <b>local</b> and national economies make better productive use of diversity as an economic resource and to strengthen social cohesion by fostering better communication and mutual understanding; 3. to understand better how the cultural richness of these new cities can strengthen the “diverse unity” of the 21 st century. The city of Utrecht is full of examples of manifestations of bilingualism. One of our main findings however is that the public’s opinions on plurilingualism differ according to its type. Bilingualism in Dutch plus another European or Western language is considered something positive which enables communication with foreigners and adds to the city’s character. Bilingualism in Turkish or Berber (large migrant languages) plus Dutch, on the other side, is considered an obstacle to integration. In the course of this report we present data and examples of plurilingualism and multilingualism in Utrecht which help to define the city. In the final chapter we add some recommendations to improve the positive aspects and impact of multi/plurilingualism and to deal with their challenges in the best possible way...|$|R
