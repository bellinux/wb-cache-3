5|$|This unusual triad occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the <b>lysine</b> acts to polarise {{the middle}} serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one {{with the side}} chain hydroxyl {{and the other with}} the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the <b>lysine</b> and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same <b>lysine</b> also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E

Chemical modification with the monofunctional reagent N-succinimidyl 3 -(4 -hydroxy, 5 - 125 I-iodophenyl) propionate {{results in a}} predominant labelling of VPI and VP 3, whereas VP 2 is less accessible and VP 4 is not modified. Cross-linking of poliovirus with bifunctional imidoesters, dimethyl suberimidate (DMS, l-I nm) and dimethyl adipimidate (DMA, o- 8 nm) leads to a new protein complex of mol. wt. which corresponds to the sum of VPI and VP 3. By cleavage with ammonia and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide g ls in SDS, the proteins are identified as VPI and VP 3. This result gives evidence for a direct neighbourhood of VPI and VP 3 in the virus capsid.

5000|$|H3 and H4 histone {{proteins}} are {{the primary}} targets of HATs, but H2A and H2B are also acetylated in vivo. <b>Lysines</b> 9, 14, 18, and 23 of H3 and <b>lysines</b> 5, 8, 12, and 16 of H4 are all targeted for acetylation.

An example of this specificity is when histone H4 is acetylated at <b>lysines</b> 5 and 12. This acetylation pattern has been seen during histone synthesis.

Acetylation occurs at four <b>lysines</b> {{located at the}} C terminus of Fen 1, which is important for DNA binding. In this paper we show that Fen 1 mutant proteins lacking the <b>lysines</b> at the C terminus have both reduced PCNA independent exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities. However, <b>lysines</b> at the C terminus are not required for PCNA stimulation of human Fen 1. A double flap substrate was optimal for human Fen 1 endonuclease and did not require the C-terminal <b>lysines.</b> Similarly, a one nucleotide 3 '-overhang nick substrate was optimal for human Fen 1 exonuclease and also did not require the C-terminal <b>lysines.</b> Finally, we found by an electromobility shift assay that human Fen 1 had a different mode of binding with a double flap substrate containing a one nucleotide 3 '-tail when compared to various other flap substrates. Taken together, our results confirm the double flap substrate as the likely in vivo intermediate for human Fen 1 and that the C-terminal <b>lysines</b> are important for the endonuclease and exonuclease activities likely through DNA binding...|$|R

5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven <b>lysine</b> residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to <b>lysine</b> 48 of the previous ubiquitin {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E

Bovine α-lactalbumin (α-LA) is a globular 123 amino acid Ca 2 + binding milk protein. Modification with microbial Ca 2 + independent transglutaminase (MTGase) was used to modify <b>lysines</b> and glutamines in holo and apo α-LA. At 30 °C no <b>lysines</b> or glutamines are modified in holo α-LA, whereas in apo α-LA <b>lysines</b> 13, 16, 108, and 114, and glutamines 39 and 43, are modified. At 50 °C <b>lysines</b> 13, 16, 108, and 114, but no glutamines, are modified in holo α-LA, whereas in apo α-LA <b>lysines</b> 5, 13, 16, 108, and 114, and glutamines 39, 43, 54, 65, and 117, are modified.

40|$|We report here a new entropic {{mechanism}} of protein thermostability due to residual dynamics of rotamer isomerization in native state. All-atom simulations show that <b>Lysines</b> have much {{greater number of}} accessible rotamers than Arginines in folded states of proteins.

Indeed we show in computational experiments that Arginine-to-Lysine amino acid substitutions result in noticeable stabilization of proteins. We then hypothesize that if evolution uses this physical mechanisms in its strategies of thermophilic adaptation then hyperthermostable organisms would have much greater content of <b>Lysines</b> in their proteomes than of comparable in size and similarly charged Arginines [...] Consistent with that, high-throughput comparative analysis of complete proteomes shows extremely strong bias towards Arginine-to-Lysine replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms and overall much greater content of <b>Lysines</b> than Arginines in hyperthermophiles.

This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: <b>lysine,</b> methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E

40|$|Newly {{synthesized}} histone H 4 is {{deposited in}} a diacetylated isoform {{in a wide}} variety of organisms. In Tetrahymena a specific pair of residues, <b>lysines</b> 4 and 11, have been shown to undergo this modification in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that the analogous residues, <b>lysines</b> 5 and 12, are acetylated in Drosophila and HeLa H 4. These data strongly suggest that deposition-related acetylation sites in H 4 have been highly, perhaps absolutely, conserved. In Tetrahymena and Drosophila newly synthesized histone H 3 is also deposited in several modified forms. Using pulse-labeled H 3 we have determined that, like H 4, a specific, but distinct, subset of <b>lysines</b> is acetylated in these organisms. In Tetrahymena, <b>lysines</b> 9 and 14 are highly preferred sites of acetylation in new H 3 while in Drosophila, <b>lysines</b> 14 and 23 are strongly preferred. No evidence has been obtained for acetylation of newly synthesized H 3 in HeLa cells.

5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 <b>lysine</b> 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that the fat-derived hormone adiponectin {{has the ability to}} decrease hyperglycemia and to reverse insulin resistance. However, bacterially produced full-length adiponectin is functionally inactive. Here, we show that endogenous adiponectin secreted by adipocytes is post-translationally modified into eight different isoforms, as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Carbohydrate detection revealed that six of the adiponectin isoforms are glycosylated. The glycosylation sites were mapped to several <b>lysines</b> (residues 68, 71, 80, and 104) located in the collagenous domain of adiponectin, each having the surrounding motif of GXKGE(D). These four <b>lysines</b> were found to be hydroxylated and subsequently glycosylated. The glycosides attached to each of these four hydroxylated <b>lysines</b> are possibly glucosylgalactosyl groups. Functional analysis revealed that full-length adiponectin produced by mammalian cells is much more potent than bacterially generated adiponectin in enhancing the ability of subphysiological concentrations of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis in primary rat hepatocytes, whereas this insulin-sensitizing ability was significantly attenuated when the four glycosylated <b>lysines</b> were substituted with arginines. These results indicate that full-length adiponectin produced by mammalian cells is functionally active as an insulin sensitizer and that hydroxylation and glycosylation of the four <b>lysines</b> in the collagenous domain might contribute to this activity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the several}} still unexplained aspects of the {{mechanism}} by which the Cdc 34 /SCF RING-type ubiquitin ligases work is the marked stimulation of Cdc 34 autoubiquitination, a phenomenon of unknown mechanism and significance. In in vitro experiments with single-lysine-containing Cdc 34 mutant proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{we found that the}} SCF-mediated stimulation of autoubiquitination is limited to specific N-terminal <b>lysines</b> modified via an intermolecular mechanism. In a striking contrast, SCF quenches autoubiquitination of C-terminal <b>lysines</b> catalyzed in an intramolecular manner. Unlike autoubiquitination of the C-terminal <b>lysines,</b> which has no functional consequence, autoubiquitination of the N-terminal <b>lysines</b> inhibits Cdc 34.

Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species.
