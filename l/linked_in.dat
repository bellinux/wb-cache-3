5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> {{the system of}} the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to improve}} the knowledge of knots and <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces. If the lens space L(p,q) is defined as a 3 -ball with suitable boundary identifications, then a <b>link</b> <b>in</b> L(p,q) can be represented by a disk diagram, i. e. a regular projection of the link on a disk. In this contest, we obtain a complete finite set of Reidemeister-type moves establishing equivalence, up to ambient isotopy. Moreover, the connections of this new diagram with both grid and band diagrams for <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces are shown. A Wirtinger-type presentation for the group of the link and a diagrammatic method giving the first homology group are described. A class of twisted Alexander polynomials for <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces is computed, showing its correlation with Reidemeister torsion. One of the most important geometric invariants of <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces is the lift in 3 -sphere of a <b>link</b> L <b>in</b> L(p,q), that is the counterimage of L under the universal covering of L(p,q). Starting from the disk diagram of the link, we obtain a diagram of the lift in the 3 -sphere. Using this construction it is possible to find different knots and <b>links</b> <b>in</b> L(p,q) having equivalent lifts, hence we cannot distinguish different <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces only from their lift. The two final chapters investigate whether several existing invariants for <b>links</b> <b>in</b> lens spaces are essential, i. e. whether they may assume different values on links with equivalent lift. Namely, we consider the fundamental quandle, the group of the link, the twisted Alexander polynomials, the Kauffman Bracket Skein Module and an HOMFLY-PT-type invariant...|$|R

5|$|Once a vital ritual {{among the}} world's monarchies, coronations {{have changed over}} time {{for a variety of}} socio-political and {{religious}} factors; most modern monarchies have dispensed with them altogether, preferring simpler ceremonies to mark a monarch's accession to the throne. In the past, concepts of royalty, coronation and deity were often inexorably <b>linked.</b> <b>In</b> some ancient cultures, rulers were considered to be divine or partially divine: the Egyptian pharaoh was believed to be the son of Ra, the sun god, while in Japan, the emperor was believed to be a descendant of Amaterasu, the sun goddess. Rome promulgated the practice of emperor worship; in Medieval Europe, monarchs claimed to have a divine right to rule (analogous to the Mandate of Heaven in dynastic China). Coronations were once a direct visual expression of these alleged connections, but recent centuries have seen the lessening of such beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably <b>linked.</b> <b>In</b> the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
5|$|The rotund to {{ellipsoid}} spores are 7.5–10µm {{long and}} 6–7.6µm wide. The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a granular body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and grained. Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early developmental stage). The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped and transparent, and often contain a granular material. The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or granular. Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are <b>linked</b> <b>in</b> a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E
