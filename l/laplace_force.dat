40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop and validate a numerical model to study wetting during the impact of millimeter-size drops on a flat, smooth, solid substrate under isothermal or non-isothermal conditions. A finite-element modeling is used to simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer, considering <b>Laplace</b> <b>forces</b> on the liquid-gas boundary.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a device which is {{particularly}} relevant to test 3 D quasi-static magnetic numerical computations: axial eddy-current couplings. It consists in two rotors, a driving and a driven one. The driving rotor is made with a ring of magnets, alternating north and south poles, glued on an iron yoke. The driven one is constituted by only a copper ring and another yoke. The rotating permanent magnets induces eddy currents in copper, producing an electromagnetic torque and {{the rotation of the}} copper side. The phenomena are analogous to those existing in an induction machine. This application is a really interesting test case because of the following advantages: 1. Its geometry is purely 3 D but simple. It can be meshed with structured or unstructured grid and includes anti-periodic symmetries. 2. The eddy currents due to movement can be treated without remeshing. 3. There are two kinds of field sources: magnets and eddy-currents. 4. The simplicity of the device permits to easily build prototypes and to obtain experimental measurements needed to validate computational results. The authors had performed several numerical FEM computations on this particular device. The eddy currents problem is solved thanks to two classical formulations based on magnetic vector and scalar potentials, i. e. (a, v) and (h e, φ). The general GPL solver GetDP had been chosen because it really suits to our weak formulations. A comparison between these two formulations has been performed. Problems can be solved both considering a linear b(h) relationship, or a more realistic curve. A special focus is put on the electromagnetic torque evaluation thanks to three post-processing computations: <b>Laplace</b> <b>forces</b> (L-F), average Maxwell stress tensor in the airgap (M-T), and global Joule losses (J-L).

40|$|Reversible {{compensatory}} hypertrophy in rat kidneys: Morphometric characterization. Functional renal compensatory hypertrophy (RCH) in the uninephrectomized rat {{is completely}} reversible by transplantation in Brown Norway (BN) rats, while anatomic RCH is not. To determine the nephron element(s) responsible for persistent anatomic RCH, we performed morphometric analysis on perfusion fixed rat kidneys following renal function studies. In this model {{the function of}} renal transplants is not different from contralateral and unmanipulated control kidneys, {{and there is no}} histological evidence of rejection. Rats uninephrectomized for three or six weeks had larger glomeruli than controls, and after transplantation of a previously hypertrophied kidney into a rat with a normal or a solitary hypertrophied kidney, glomerular size returned to control levels. Increased glomerular capillary volume (CVCP) in kidneys with RCH was due to increased capillary length (LCP; 13. 1 ± 1. 0 mm cf. 10. 3 ± 0. 9, P < 0. 01) without increase in capillary radius (RCP; 3. 26 ± 0. 33 µM cf. 3. 28 ± 0. 24). In contrast, return of CVCP to control levels in kidneys undergoing regression was associated with persistently elevated LCP (13. 0 ± 2. 9 mm; native previously hypertrophied kidney; 12. 2 ± 0. 9; transplanted previously hypertrophied kidney vs. 10. 3 ± 0. 9, P < 0. 01) and decreased RCP (2. 79 ± 0. 10 µM and 2. 73 ± 0. 09 cf 3. 28 ± 0. 24, P < 0. 01). RCH was associated with proportional increases in glomerular, tubular, and vascular-interstitial volumes while only elevated tubular volume persisted during regression. Altered glomerular capillary dimensions and increased tubular volumes acquired during renal RCH induced by unilateral nephrectomy persisted during complete functional regression. Since CVCP increase in RCH is not associated with an increase of RCP, a pathogenetic role for <b>LaPlace</b> <b>forces</b> based on more extensive models of nephron ablation may not be applicable to the uninephrectomy model...|$|R

40|$|TDIGG is a {{fast and}} {{versatile}} program for generating two-dimensional computational grids {{for use with}} finite-difference flow-solvers. Both algebraic and elliptic grid generation systems are included. The method for grid generation by algebraic transformation {{is based on an}} interpolation algorithm and the elliptic grid generation is established by solving the partial differential equation (PDE). Non-uniform grid distributions are carried out using a hyperbolic tangent stretching function. For algebraic grid systems, interpolations in one direction (univariate) and two directions (bivariate) are considered. These interpolations are associated with linear or cubic Lagrangian/Hermite/Bezier polynomial functions. The algebraic grids can subsequently be smoothed using an elliptic solver. For elliptic grid systems, the PDE can be in the form of <b>Laplace</b> (zero <b>forcing</b> function) or Poisson. The forcing functions in the Poisson equation come from the boundary or the entire domain of the initial algebraic grids. A graphics interface procedure using the Silicon Graphics (GL) Library is included to allow users to visualize the grid variations at each iteration. This will allow users to interactively modify the grid to match their applications. TDIGG is written in FORTRAN 77 for Silicon Graphics IRIS series computers running IRIX. This package requires either MIT's X Window System, Version 11 Revision 4 or SGI (Motif) Window System. A sample executable is provided on the distribution medium.
