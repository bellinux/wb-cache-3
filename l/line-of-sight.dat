5|$|The {{galaxies in}} the {{constellation}} are faint. IC 4633 is a very faint spiral galaxy surrounded by {{a vast amount of}} Milky Way <b>line-of-sight</b> integrated flux nebulae—large faint clouds thought to be lit by large numbers of stars.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 b was {{discovered}} by detecting small periodic variations in the radial velocity of its parent star caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet. This was achieved by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. In 2001 {{it was announced that}} HD 28185 exhibited a wobble along the <b>line-of-sight</b> with a period of 383 days, with an amplitude indicating a minimum mass 5.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital inclination to our <b>line-of-sight.</b> Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field, {{and the size of the}} splitting is linearly proportional to the <b>line-of-sight</b> magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range <b>line-of-sight</b> communications for improved command and control.|$|E
5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} <b>line-of-sight.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear <b>line-of-sight</b> between the two towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the <b>line-of-sight.</b> If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed <b>line-of-sight</b> to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a <b>line-of-sight</b> mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Boyd {{returned}} to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, {{where he worked}} as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an Army Air Corps-sponsored project studying microwave propagation. As part of the project, he conducted long-range <b>line-of-sight</b> experiments between Georgia Tech and Mount Oglethorpe in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves, {{which resulted in a}} series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on radar-directed fire control. Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia Tech and the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent <b>line-of-sight</b> of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} <b>line-of-sight,</b> with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the <b>line-of-sight</b> velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E
25|$|The major {{limitation}} with Doppler spectroscopy {{is that it}} {{can only}} measure movement along the <b>line-of-sight,</b> and so depends on a measurement (or estimate) of the inclination of the planet's orbit to determine the planet's mass. If the orbital plane of the planet happens to line up with the <b>line-of-sight</b> of the observer, then the measured variation in the star's radial velocity is the true value. However, if the orbital plane is tilted away from the <b>line-of-sight,</b> then the true effect of the planet on the motion of the star will be greater than the measured variation in the star's radial velocity, which is only the component along the <b>line-of-sight.</b> As a result, the planet's true mass will be greater than measured.|$|E
25|$|Lock On After Launch (LOAL) for non <b>line-of-sight</b> (NLOS) {{and using}} third party target designation.|$|E
25|$|Knife-edge {{diffraction}} is {{the propagation}} mode where radio waves are bent around sharp edges. For example, this mode {{is used to}} send radio signals over a mountain range when a <b>line-of-sight</b> path is not available. However, the angle cannot be too sharp or the signal will not diffract. The diffraction mode requires increased signal strength, so higher power or better antennas will be needed than for an equivalent <b>line-of-sight</b> path.|$|E
25|$|Line 1 is a {{standard}} gauge double-track tramway. Trams are driven manually under a mix of <b>line-of-sight</b> and signals. Turnback crossovers along the line, including in the street section, have point indicators.|$|E
25|$|Was {{responsible}} for launch and {{recovery of the}} MQ-1B Predator unmanned aerial systems in Iraq. The Predator provides intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability for 24-hour coverage of the Iraqi battlespace. The squadron also provides a <b>line-of-sight</b> base-defense mission for JBB.|$|E
25|$|For {{passenger}} vehicles at two lane intersections, this time gap equivalence is commonly a distance 7.5 seconds {{away at the}} design speed. Longer gaps are required for trucks and buses, and for multilane roads. Generally, the public right-of-way should include and maintain this <b>line-of-sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even though early telegraphic precedents, such as {{signalling}} {{through the}} lighting of pyres, have existed since ancient times, long-distance telegraphy (transmission of complex messages) started in 1792 {{in the form}} of semaphore lines, or optical telegraphs, that sent messages to a distant observer through <b>line-of-sight</b> signals. Commercial electrical telegraphs were introduced from 1837.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{operation}} of the Sheffield Supertram {{are similar to those}} of a traditional railway. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated without signalling, although block signalling is sometimes necessary on single-line sections. The trams are driven on a <b>line-of-sight</b> basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.|$|E
25|$|Myer's Civil War {{innovations}} {{included an}} unsuccessful balloon experiment at First Bull Run, and, {{in response to}} McClellan's desire for a Signal Corps field telegraph train, an electric telegraph {{in the form of}} the Beardslee magnetoelectric telegraph machine. Even in the Civil War, the wigwag system, restricted to <b>line-of-sight</b> communications, was waning in the face of the electric telegraph.|$|E
25|$|To {{correct for}} this effect, and so {{determine}} the true mass of an extrasolar planet, radial-velocity measurements {{can be combined}} with astrometric observations, which track {{the movement of the}} star across the plane of the sky, perpendicular to the <b>line-of-sight.</b> Astrometric measurements allows researchers to check whether objects that appear to be high mass planets {{are more likely to be}} brown dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{carries a}} variety of sensors in the nose, Q-bay (behind the cockpit, {{also known as the}} camera bay), and wing pods. The U-2 is capable of simultaneously collecting signals, imagery intelligence and air samples. Imagery intelligence sensors include either wet film photography, electro-optic, or radar imagery–the latter from the Raytheon ASARS-2 system. It can use both <b>line-of-sight</b> and over-horizon data links.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the new Insight includes {{a variation of the}} two-tier instrument panel first introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic. In this arrangement, a digital speedometer is mounted high on the instrument panel within the driver’s normal <b>line-of-sight</b> for ease of visibility. An analog tachometer, fuel gauge, hybrid assist gauge, and Multi-Information Display are housed in the lower tier.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{majority}} of fully autonomous tractors navigate using lasers that bounce signals off several mobile transponders located around the field. These lasers are accompanied with 150MHz radios to deal with <b>line-of-sight</b> issues. Instead of drivers, the tractors have controllers. Controllers are people that supervise the tractors without being inside them. These controllers can supervise multiple tractors on multiple fields from one location.|$|E
25|$|ACARS {{can send}} {{messages}} over VHF if a VHF ground station network {{exists in the}} current area of the aircraft. VHF communication is <b>line-of-sight</b> propagation and the typical range is up to 200 nautical miles at high altitudes. Where VHF is absent, an HF network or satellite communication may be used if available. Satellite coverage may be limited at high latitudes (trans-polar flights).|$|E
25|$|However, when vapor {{deposition}} {{is performed}} at pressures of roughly 10−4 Torr (1.3 hPa) or higher, significant scattering of the vapor cloud takes place such that surfaces not {{in sight of}} the source can be coated. Strictly speaking, the slow transition from <b>line-of-sight</b> to scattered deposition is determined not only by pressure (or mean free path) but also by source-to-substrate distance.|$|E
25|$|The Yamaha R-MAX is a Japanese {{unmanned}} helicopter {{developed by}} the Yamaha Motor Company in the 1990s. The two-bladed, gasoline-powered aircraft is remote-controlled by a <b>line-of-sight</b> user; it was designed primarily for agricultural use, and is capable of precise aerial spraying of crops. The R-MAX {{has been used in}} Japan and abroad for agriculture {{and a variety of other}} roles, including reconnaissance, disaster response and technology development.|$|E
25|$|Marighella {{speaks of}} the urban {{environment}} as being as or more concealing than the jungle. Walls, roofs, and other structural features interrupt <b>line-of-sight</b> (LOS) and make overhead imagery of less value in urban areas than in others. Such barriers preclude penetration by many sensors. There may be a limited capability provided by advanced thermal sensors, and, if available, penetrating radar, typically from airborne or spaceborne senseors that are not readily available.|$|E
25|$|Official {{requirements}} {{were published}} in 1945; Bell Laboratories won the Ordnance contract for a short-range <b>line-of-sight</b> weapon under Project Nike, while a team of players led by Boeing won the contract for a long-range design known as Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft, or GAPA. GAPA moved to the US Air Force when that branch was formed in 1948. In 1946 the USAAF also started two early research projects into anti-missile systems in Project Thumper and Project Wizard.|$|E
25|$|Hercules {{also offered}} {{the ability to}} attack pre-located ground targets, after feeding in the {{coordinates}} in an operation that took about five minutes. For these missions the computer used the MTR to guide the missile to a point above the target, then commanded it to dive vertically while measuring any changes in trajectory as it fell. The missile would eventually pass out of <b>line-of-sight</b> with the MTR, so final arming information was provided during the dive, and the warhead was triggered by a barometric fuse.|$|E
25|$|Trench warfare {{is highly}} {{beneficial}} to the defender if the enemy could not use tanks and <b>line-of-sight</b> artillery. Thus flexible defense puts firepower into defensive fighting positions such as trenches, saps, firebays and earth-wooden made pillboxes. This was an advantage because since it was less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against. Thus, the task of defense force is to protect anti-tank obstacles against hostile sappers in order to coerce enemy to attack trenches with conventional infantry attack. In ideal case the entrenched defense can successfully facing with enemy up to ten times numerical superiority.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} problem {{occurs when}} light must {{pass through a}} very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a darkened room, with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly lit room), or {{a scene in which}} most points do not have direct <b>line-of-sight</b> to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or torchieres). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; Metropolis light transport is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers {{have a wide}} {{number of}} {{applications}}. They are used as light guides in medical and other applications where bright light needs to be shone on a target without a clear <b>line-of-sight</b> path. In some buildings, optical fibers route sunlight from the roof {{to other parts of}} the building (see nonimaging optics). Optical-fiber lamps are used for illumination in decorative applications, including signs, art, toys and artificial Christmas trees. Swarovski boutiques use optical fibers to illuminate their crystal showcases from many different angles while only employing one light source. Optical fiber is an intrinsic part of the light-transmitting concrete building product LiTraCon.|$|E
