5|$|Overall, the Columbidae {{tend to have}} short legs, short {{bills with}} a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. In a series of {{experiments}} in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown {{to be due to}} their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large, and have eleven primary feathers, and <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly manoeuvrable in flight.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{elements}} of Istiodactylus {{were used to}} model pterosaur wing-mechanics by Ernest H. Hankin and David M. S. Watson in 1914, and by Cherrie D. Bramwell and George R. Whitfield in 1974, but the details of istiodactylid flight performance have not been studied. Witton suggested that istiodactylids would have been powerful fliers, due to an enlarged area for downstroke musculature attachments and well-developed pectoral and upper arm bones, and they probably spent {{much time in the}} air. Istiodactylids had wing-membranes connected to shortened bodies with short legs and long forelimbs, which may have created large wings with a high aspect ratio and <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> loadings. The wings of the istiodactylid Nurhachius have been compared to those of modern soaring birds (that fly with little flapping), and may have been ideal for low-energy soaring, which is necessary when searching for carrion. Flight is very important to birds that scavenge, as it helps them locate, reach, and eat carcasses before they are found by terrestrial carnivores. The wings of istiodactylids seem to have been shorter than those of other ornithocheiroids, which may have been more adapted to oceanic soaring; their wings may have been more suited for taking off and landing. Modern birds that soar inland have shorter and deeper wings than those that soar over the ocean; the wing shape of istiodactylids indicate that they may have preferred terrestrial settings.|$|E

50|$|In a {{practical}} landplane design, the lower set of wings are typically set approximately {{level with the}} underside of the aircraft's fuselage, the middle set level with the top of the fuselage, and the top set supported above the fuselage on cabane struts. In {{a practical}} flying boat, even the <b>lowest</b> <b>wing</b> must be placed well above the waterline of the hull, creating a tall structure overall.|$|R

25|$|The Pioneer 400 is a <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane, with a {{trapezoidal}} plan wing {{that has}} sweep {{only on the}} trailing edge and winglets at its tips.

Both ailerons and flaps are fabric covered.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} century, King William III's massive rebuilding and expansion project, which destroyed {{much of the}} Tudor palace, was intended to rival Versailles. Work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic Tudor and Baroque. While the palace's styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due {{to the use of}} pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive <b>low</b> <b>wings.</b> King George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{designers}} {{may increase}} dihedral angle to provide greater clearance between the wing tips and the runway. This {{is of particular}} concern with swept-wing aircraft, whose wingtips could hit the runway on rotation/touchdown. In military aircraft dihedral angle space {{may be used for}} mounting materiel and drop-tanks on wing hard points, especially in aircraft with <b>low</b> <b>wings.</b> The increased dihedral effect caused by this design choice may need to be compensated for, perhaps by decreasing the dihedral angle on the horizontal tail.|$|R

25|$|Only a few {{animals are}} known to have {{specialised}} in soaring: the larger of the extinct pterosaurs, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift. Soaring is very energetically efficient.|$|E
25|$|The C.430 Rafale was a two-seat {{development}} of the single seat Caudron C.362, {{the winner of the}} 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe. Slightly larger and heavier, though with a lower wing loading, the Rafale was a <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> cantilever monoplane, wood framed and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its one piece, single spar wing was strongly straight tapered to elliptical tips and was plywood covered with an outer layer of fabric. There were flaps inboard of the ailerons.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of <b>low</b> <b>wing</b> loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
