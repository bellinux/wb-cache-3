It was not really a slipper, but a <b>low</b> <b>shoe</b> of blue, glazed kid, rubbed and shabby. It had straps to go over the instep, but the girl only thrust her feet in, after her slovenly manner. Jacobus raised his eyes from the shoe to look at me.|$|E
5000|$|A buskin is a knee- or calf-length boot made {{of leather}} or cloth which laces closed, but is open across the toes. It was worn by Athenian tragic actors, hunters and {{soldiers}} in Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman societies. The word buskin, only recorded in English since 1503 meaning [...] "half boot", is of unknown origin, perhaps from Old French brousequin (in modern French brodequin) or directly from its Middle Dutch model brosekin [...] "small leather boot". Figurative senses relating to tragedy {{are from the}} word being used (since 1570) to translate Greek kothornos or Latin cothurnos, the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with sock (from Latin soccus), the <b>low</b> <b>shoe</b> worn by comedians.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: The {{benefits}} of side-shift therapy {{associated with a}} shoe lift in scoliosis can act by reorganizing the asymmetries found in these individuals. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the influence of side-shift therapy with or without a high or <b>low</b> <b>shoe</b> lift in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Materials and Methods: 10 individuals of both genders, aged 13 - 24 years, were selected, with scoliosis "S" and right thoracic and left lumbar greater than 10 º. Initially the order of the task was static and then dynamic, after which there was a draw for the conditions with the shoe lift. The values of postural angles during the five lateral tilt movements were obtained and also the minimum and maximum values of each movement. The average value of postural angle in the static position, without a shoe lift, was used as a reference. Results: The movement associated with the shoe lift demonstrated less significant results compared with the effect of the static shoe lift and the side-shift movements performed in isolation, no significant results in any angle were found. Discussion: Both movements, to the side of the convexity or to the opposite side, seemed to decrease the effect of the shoe lift. The side-shift movement performed in isolation failed to influence the postural angles in general, demonstrating that acute intervention may not be efficient. Conclusion: The influence of side-shift therapy associated with a high or <b>low</b> <b>shoe</b> lift on both sides was effective, but the shoe lift in the static position produced the most significant changes and therefore is considered a better intervention in order to prevent the progression of double curve in patients with idiopathic scoliosis...|$|E

5000|$|The 1950s were a time {{of fashion}} evolution. At the {{beginning}} of the decade, fitted blouses and jackets with rounded (as opposed to puffy) shoulders and small, round collars were very popular.

Thick, heavy heels were popular for <b>low</b> <b>shoes.</b> Socks were sometimes worn, but were not as necessary as they are now. Circle skirts (like the classic poodle skirt) were very popular. They were often hand decorated with various patterns or beads to make them unique [...] and worn over petticoats. Shirt dresses with large, contrasting buttons were also stylish. Early 1950s women wore small hats over hair cut short, à la Audrey Hepburn.|$|R
