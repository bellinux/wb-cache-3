Minimization of energy usage is the key to improve sustainability where the actual impact is assessed on the basis of life cycle cost estimates. In this context, the performance of insulated roof slabs which can be used as an alternative to conventional <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> <b>roofs,</b> have been assessed in detail especially with respect to air conditioned buildings. It is shown that insulated roof slabs could have a desirable behaviour with respect to life cycle performance in addition to providing other benefits such as cyclone resistance and higher robustness to the building...|$|R
40|$|FRP Strengthening {{has been}} {{developed}} worldwide as a mean of strengthening and retrofitting concrete structures throughout past few decades. The ever increasing loads on structures and change of use demands higher load carrying capacities. The use of FRP strengthening methods has enabled the use of existing structures thus saving millions, valuable material and valuable time will otherwise be spending on demolition and reconstruction. However lack of design guidance has been a critical issue in this area. The authors have carried-out a design and implementation of FRP strengthening of an existing two storey building to accommodate two more floors and a <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> <b>roof.</b> This paper discusses the design method, testing carried out and practical implications in FRP strengthening of concrete columns...|$|R
50|$|Metal roofing is also lightweight, {{and can be}} {{installed}} {{on top of an}} existing roof. A lightweight roof is very useful for large and or old structures, as it helps to maintain the overall structural integrity of the building. Despite its <b>light</b> <b>weight,</b> metal <b>roofing</b> provides increased wind resistance when compared to other roofing materials. This is because metal roofing systems use interlocking panels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two Finite Element (FE) {{models are}} built to {{simulate}} diaphragm action on <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> <b>roof</b> elements made of plywood, metal sheeting and solid wood rows. One model {{is simple and}} one is complex. The scope {{of this study is}} to verify the FE-models by full scale tests previously done. To compare the model and the tests both global and local deformations on the elements will be considered. The models will form a foundation for further development of FE- analysis based calculations for practical and scientific proposes on Lett-Tak AS. The FE-models built has not fully been verified by the tests, but the model simulates and quantifies important effects observed in the test. Among these effects are increasing of shear capacity of the plywood diaphragm because large forces are transmitted to the edge-beams. And uplift forces because of eccentricity between the plywood panels and the support joint on the edge beam. It has been shown that the configuration used to model the fasteners in the gable support overestimates the stiffness and ultimate load of the fastener. The FE-model developed in this study, a foundation for further research on the stress and strain interactions between the material components and joints...|$|R

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>weight</b> {{structures}} {{have much}} structural merits than ordinary building element in <b>roof</b> <b>structure.</b> Tensioning Air Beam System (TABS) {{which consists of}} air beam and cable strut is a <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> structure system and hybrid system. Several researches which concerned to tensioning pneumatic structure reported in recent year, especially Tensairity is representative of tensioning pneumatic structure. In Tensairity, compression and tension are physically separated. Low pressure compressed air is used for pre-tensioning the tension element and for stabilizing the compression element against buckling. Previous researches of Tensairity show structural ability of a typical air pressure beam. Therefore, there is necessary to make an interrelation between air pressure and structural abilities of tensioning air beam qualitatively. In this study, a number of specimens were tested with different air pressure condition...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is extremely <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> and features very few conventional materials. The main <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> {{is almost entirely}} composed of the recycled wings. The use of the wings makes for a structure that uses materials more efficiently to achieve higher strength with less weight. Using the wings to achieve the curvilinear <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> desired by the client saved {{a substantial amount of}} embodied energy, carbon dioxide output, and construction waste, compared to building a similar sized house made from conventional materials {{that would have to be}} transported up and down the mountain to the same location. Using the wing was also a substantial cost reduction. Even at $8-18,000 per hour for the helicopter and $30,000 for the 747, it was still a fraction of the cost of building a similarly shaped roof with conventional materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{double layer}} open-web <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> {{is a type}} of heat {{preservation}} and insulation <b>roof</b> <b>structures,</b> in particular suitable for medium and large span <b>roof</b> <b>structures.</b> However, the construction procedures for traditional open-web <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> are rather complicated because of the built-in molds in the cavity. On the other hand, passive ventilation is an effective route to enhance the thermal performance of the building envelope. In this paper, an improved open-web <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> is presented. The steel tube shear connectors are employed to replace the tubby reinforced concrete shear connectors. The adopted shear connectors have small holes in the middle part of their heights. This improvement not only simplifies the construction procedures, but also enhances the thermal performance for open-web <b>roof</b> <b>structures.</b> In order to verify the effectiveness of proposed new open-web roofs, experiments with temperature measurements were performed for a real <b>roof</b> <b>structure.</b> The measured results show that nearly half of the heat flow is drawn out from the cavity due to the induced ventilation. The proposed new open-web roofs have significant improvement and effectiveness on thermal performances, when comparing with traditional open-web <b>roof</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

The structures are defined and compared according to load-carrying system, included parts, centre distances, slope of roof, connection with wall, joints, outer roofing and decorations. We found many structural similarities and the structures seemingly belong to the same building historical context while also showing regional differences. The early medieval <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> of North-Western Europe can generally and concisely be described as common rafter roofs with tie beams, without longitudinal bracing systems and having strut beams and collar beams in different combinations to support the rafters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} study {{effectiveness}} of dome shaped roofing in reduction of deformations under lateral loading is discussed. A comparison was made between a flat <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> and a dome <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> on deformations imposed under lateral loading. STAAD Pro software {{was used to evaluate}} deformations, bending moments and shear forces under different combinations of loads. For the same column and beam sizes it was observed that deformation in dome <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> is 30 % less than that in flat <b>roof</b> <b>structure.</b> Similar reduction in bending moments and shear forces were also observed. On the other hand, for the same deformation, the sizes of columns were needed to be increased by 40 % in the flat <b>roof</b> <b>structure.</b> The present study concludes that a considerable amount of material and money can be saved in choosing a dome shaped roof with a marginal loss in floor area and a total loss of the utility of a flat roof...|$|R

40|$|Introduction A tensile-compression ring {{structure}} {{is derived from}} the spoke wheel principle. The general shape of the ground plan of a regular football stadium, which is more oval or rectangular shaped, is in contradiction with the spoke wheel principle. The goal of the thesis is to investigate the use and attractiveness of the spoke wheel principle for football stadia Research The thesis consists of an analysis and design component. The spoke wheel principle for the use for bicycles and for <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> have been analysed. By designing a <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> more insight is gained and conclusions can be made regarding the use of the spoke wheel <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> for football stadia. Analysis The strength and stiffness of the wheel depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. When a tensile load acts on the ring, the ring becomes compressed and ring action arises. This principle can be applied for <b>roof</b> <b>structures.</b> The more ring action can be provided, the more efficient the <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> will become and more material will be saved. The amount of ring action in a spoke wheel depends on four key factors: strength of the ring, loads, translation and curvature. To come to a design, the influence of different design variables on the key factors have been investigated. Design For the study of the use of the spoke wheel principle for stadia <b>roof</b> <b>structure,</b> two types of <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> are investigated: Non-pretensioned spokes In a spatial truss system beam action will {{play an important role in}} the total stiffness of the <b>roof</b> <b>structure.</b> By directly transporting the loads to the ring elements that possess sufficient curvature, the ring action is used at full extend. The results confirm that the efficiency of the structure increases. By optimizing each single element in the <b>roof</b> <b>structure,</b> using parametric modelling, a lot of material can be saved. Pretensioned spokes A cable {{structure is}} not able to provide stiffness by beam action. The stiffness of the <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. The results showed that the reference stadium possess not enough curvature to provide an efficient spoke wheel roof by means of a cable structure. Further research is needed to use the available ring action at a greater extend for cable <b>roof</b> <b>structures.</b> Conclusion Research showed that a spoke wheel <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> is an attractive type of structure for stadia use. The amount of curvature in the roof is crucial whether it is possible to come to an efficient structural design. When there is a lack of curvature a spatial truss structure is able to provide extra stiffness to the <b>roof.</b> Cable <b>structures</b> are very dependent from ring action, it is advised to use this type of <b>structure</b> only for <b>roofs</b> that possess curvature in the complete roof. To increase the application of the cable <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> more research is needed. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
