5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. <b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. <b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> his father, Favre became {{fluent in}} the {{languages}} of French, English, Spanish, and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw. The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British {{for nearly two decades}} following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time. On September 3, 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles. Favre's father had just died the year before this treaty, and Simon Favre followed his father's career, also inheriting his father's plantation on the Pearl River, though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother.|$|E

40|$|International audienceColor {{names are}} {{required}} in real-world {{applications such as}} image retrieval and image annotation. Traditionally, they are <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> a collection of labelled color chips. These color chips are labelled with color names within a well-defined experimental setup by human test subjects. However naming colors in real-world images differs significantly from this experimental setting. In this paper, we investigate how color names <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> color chips compare to color names <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> real-world images. To avoid hand labelling real-world images with color names we use Google Image to collect a data set. Due to limitations of Google Image this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labelled data. We propose several variants of the PLSA model to <b>learn</b> color names <b>from</b> this noisy data. Experimental results show that color names <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> real-world images significantly outperform color names <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> labelled color chips for both image retrieval and image annotation...|$|R

Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E

Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her.

After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, this was only because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E

Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is {{slightly}} empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
