5|$|The {{region is}} {{home to one of}} the largest populations of {{endangered}} Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India; in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur and Agasthyamalai The region {{is home to}} one-third of the tiger population {{and more than half of}} the elephant population of India. There are 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves in the region.

25|$|Distribution and {{demography}} of all diurnal primates {{were studied}} in Silent Valley National Park and adjacent areas {{for a period}} of three years from 1993 to 1996. Fourteen troops of <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaque,</b> eighty-five troops of Nilgiri langur, fifteen troops of bonnet macaque and seven troops of Hanuman langur were observed. Of these, the Nilgiri langur was randomly distributed, whereas the <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaque</b> troops were confined to the southern sector of the Park. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were occasional visitors. The Silent Valley forest {{remains one of the most}} undisturbed viable habitats left for the endemic and endangered primates <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaque</b> and Nilgiri langur.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on one group each of <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> and Nilgiri langurs living as {{sympatric}} groups in a rainforest in Anaimalai Hills, Western Ghats, south India. Whereas the <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> {{were found to be}} frugivorous/ insectivorous, the Nilgiri langurs were primarily folivorous. Fruit was the only shared component in the diet of the two species. The <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> occupied a higher substratum than the Nilgiri langurs not only for their routine activities, but also for overall feeding and fruit feeding. The presence of <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> resulted in further lowering the feeding substratum and increased passivity in Nilgiri langurs. Food specialization and vertical stratification differentiate the niches of these two sympatric species...|$|R

25|$|After the {{announcement}} of imminent dam construction the valley became {{the focal point of}} Save Silent Valley, India's fiercest environmental debate of the decade. Because of concern about the endangered <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaque,</b> the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area. In 1977 the Kerala Forest Research Institute carried out an ecological impact study of the Silent Valley area and proposed that the area be declared a biosphere reserve.|$|E

40|$|Less than 2500 mature <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> (Macaca silenus) {{are left}} in the wild in the Western Ghats, India. It is {{important}} to manage and sustain the captive populations to gain an insight into this species and how to manage the wild fragmented populations. The European captive population suffers from high infant mortality, large birth intervals and a low reproductive success amongst females. Thus {{the aim of this}} study was to assess possible causes of these three factors by investigating the social structure, activity budgets and spatial relationships in the captive British and Irish population of <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques.</b> Observations were carried out at all zoos housing this species in the U. K. and Ireland. Observations were made over 12 days per zoo at 09 : 00 h, 12 : 00 h and 15 : 00 h. The average distance between individuals within a group was determined using Animal Tracker® computer software. Activity budgets were constructed for each zoo. Enclosure size, enclosure complexity, feeding regimes and visitor numbers were investigated to determine any influence on spatial separation distances and activity budgets. The social structure varied between groups due to age, sex and number of individuals and the facilities surrounding each of the groups. The degree of relatedness between females, as well as the size of enclosure, appeared to influence the spatial separation distances between individuals, although not significantly. The activity budgets varied between zoos, with autogrooming and foraging showing significant differences throughout all sampling periods. Significant differences in behaviour were also found between adult and juvenile <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> and in relation to time of day. Visitor numbers and feeding regimes appeared to have no effect on the macaques' behaviour. However, enclosure size and enclosure complexity did appear to influence behaviour. In conclusion, this study of captive <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> gives an insight into how wild fragmented populations may be influenced by a reduced and isolated habitat. This study will also provide information regarding the welfare of captive <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) has {{identified}} the park as coordinating zoo for the breeding programmes for endangered species as per the National Zoo Policy {{adopted by the}} Government of India in 1988, which states that the main objective of zoos will be to complement and strengthen national efforts in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and that the species which have no chance of survival in the wild would be bred under ex-situ conditions. The park has {{a high rate of}} success in captive breeding of lion-tailed macaques. In 2010, the zoo had 22 lion-tailed macaques, from a breeding pair that were brought to the zoo in 1983. The park is also successful in breeding other rare species in captivity, including ostrich, Asian palm civet, Indian gaur, wild dog, Asiatic lion, Nilgiri langur, sangai, hippo, Malabar giant squirrel, white tiger, Asiatic wolf, panther and bison. The zoo is among four in the country to have an ostrich. The park also undertakes cross-breeding as part of its conservation efforts. The park is also a participating zoo of the CZA for the captive breeding of rock python, Nilgiri langur, <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaque,</b> Asiatic lion, wild dog, Asiatic wolf, and gaur. The zoo also promotes exterior conservation—conservation of rare species in their natural habitat—whereby individuals born in the zoo are released in the wild after adequate training, as per the guidelines of the CZA.|$|E

40|$|During a 5 -yr {{study of}} <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques</b> {{in their natural}} habitat, we found that: 1) most births {{occurred}} from January to April (70 %) and from September to December (19 %), showing a bimodal pattern with a major and a minor birth peak; 2) the period of peaks remained the same over 5 yr; and 3) a similar pattern of birth peaks occurred both in groups in large forest complexes that had overlapping home ranges with other groups and in single groups that were isolated in forest fragments in the same region but with similar ecological conditions. The results suggest more of a birth seasonality than mere breeding synchronization in the wild <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques.</b> We also analyzed data on births in captivity in European Zoos for 10 yr. We observed no seasonality or peaks in births, and the pattern was the same over the years. Data on rainfall suggest that resource availability in the wild habitat may not be uniform throughout the year; hence, ecological factors may {{play an important role}} in determination of birth patterns in the natural habitats of <b>lion-tailed</b> <b>macaques...</b>|$|R
