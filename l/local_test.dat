2500|$|In the era {{the advice}} was {{originally}} given, {{the most common}} nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US Fat Man and Soviet Joe-1 in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This {{is due to the}} fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear fuzing height, as it exploits the mach stem phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. While Air-burst fuzing also increases the range that peoples skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris/ is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion, this [...] "delayed fallout" [...] is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker a near surface shallow (underwater burst) left the <b>local</b> <b>test</b> targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.|$|E

We demonstrate via a Monte Carlo study that although the global test may have better size and power, <b>local</b> <b>tests</b> are easier to use, and are comparable or better in terms of the power to detect periodicities, especially for spectra with a large dynamic range.

50|$|The Test Pilot School {{was housed}} {{in an old}} weather-beaten wooden hangar along the flight line of {{what became known as}} South Base. Although the {{quarters}} were spartan, the weather was superb with only two flying days lost due to weather in the first seven months of operation. Taking advantage of the calm morning air, students started the day flying missions to collect test data. Afternoons were spent in the lecture hall and evenings devoted to reducing data from the day's flights. Data reduction was dull and labor-intensive, requiring the student to transcribe information recorded on film or oscillograph paper and perform calculations by hand or slide rule. Once reduced, the data were woven into a report that summarized the test and the student's conclusions. Some students were not prepared for the rigorous academics and had to be dropped from enrollment. This situation improved in 1953 when the school was moved out of Air Research and Development Command. which allowed the selection boards to draw from a much larger, USAF-wide, pool of applicants, rather than just the <b>local</b> <b>test</b> squadrons.|$|E

The co-ioco conformance relation {{is an extension of}} this relation to concurrent systems specified with true-concurrency models. This relation assumes a global control and observation of the system under test, which is not usually realistic in the case of physically distributed systems. Such systems can be partially observed at each of their points of control and observation by the sequences of inputs and outputs exchanged with their environment. Unfortunately, in general, global observation cannot be reconstructed from local ones, so global conformance cannot be decided with <b>local</b> <b>tests.</b> We propose to append time stamps to the observable actions of the system under test in order to regain global conformance from <b>local</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

Based on the generalized nonlinear failure criterion and the limit equilibrium principle, an approach, which takes into account the shape of rapture surface, dip angle of shallow anchors, and varieties of rock and soil mass, is proposed. The effects of different parameters on ultimate uplift force of shallow anchors are discussed. In order to validate the practicability of the proposed formula, a comparison between the theoretical solutions and <b>local</b> <b>test</b> results is conducted.

In this work, we initiate a systematic study of <b>local</b> <b>testing</b> for {{membership in}} lattices, complementing and building upon the extensive body of work on locally testable codes. In particular, we formally define the notion of <b>local</b> <b>tests</b> for lattices and present the following: 1. We show {{that in order to}} achieve low query complexity, it is sufficient to design one-sided non-adaptive canonical tests. This result is akin to, and based on an analogous result for error-correcting codes due to Ben-Sasson et al. (SIAM J. Computing 35 (1) pp 1 – 21). 2. We demonstrate upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of <b>local</b> <b>testing</b> for member- ship in code formula lattices. We instantiate our results for code formula lattices constructed from Reed-Muller codes to obtain nearly-matching upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of testing such lattices. 3. We contrast lattice testing from code testing by showing lower bounds on the query com- plexity of testing low-dimensional lattices. This illustrates large lower bounds on the query complexity of testing membership in knapsack lattices. On the other hand, we show that knapsack lattices with bounded coefficients have low-query testers if the inputs are promised to lie in the span of the lattic...|$|R
