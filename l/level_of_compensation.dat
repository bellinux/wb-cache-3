5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the drivers <b>of</b> executive <b>compensation</b> for a unique sample of UK property companies. The empirical {{results indicate that}} company size {{is the most important}} variable in explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>compensation.</b> Besides that, absolute share performance is significant in explaining both cash and long-term compensation, while measures for company outperformance over the real estate sector and the UK stock market are less powerful in explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>compensation.</b> Furthermore, the use of alternative monitoring mechanisms seems to be efficient, as the preference for long-term incentivisation implemented by institutional shareholders, outside directors and debtholders leads to an increased pay-performance sensitivity. Furthermore, the presence of large blockholders amongst investors leads to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> and a relatively strong pay-performance sensitivity. Concerning the influence of sector-specific variables, we find that diversification of property investments leads to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>compensation,</b> whereas investing in high-quality property is related to a higher compensation level. ...|$|R

25|$|Surveys {{consistently}} {{rate the}} commissaries {{as one of}} the military's top nonpay benefits. Many young service families, particularly those stationed in high cost-of-living urban areas, simply could not make ends meet without the price savings provided by the commissaries. DeCA has delivered more than $2 in savings to customers for every taxpayer dollar used to support the commissary system. In other words, preserving this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> in direct dollar payments to military personnel would cost the government more than twice the current fund appropriation.|$|E
500|$|The {{privileges}} {{given to}} the Church are notable: {{in addition to the}} freedom from taxation, the oath of a bishop is [...] "incontrovertible", which places it at the same level as the oath of a king, and the Church receives the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for violence done to dependents as does the king. [...] This has led one historian to describe the Church's power, less than a century after the original Roman mission landed in Kent, as [...] "all but co-ordinate with the king himself in the Kentish state", and it has also been described as presupposing [...] "a frightening degree of royal power". [...] However, the presence of clauses that provide penalties for any of Wihtred's subjects who [...] "sacrifice to devils" [...] makes it clear that although Christianity was dominant, the older pagan beliefs of the population had by no means died out completely.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, public {{scrutiny}} surrounding rising <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> executive <b>compensation</b> {{has led to}} more stringent independence requirements for compensation committees.

My paper studies the effects <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> committee chair personal ties to the CEO, economic interests, and group committee characteristics on both the <b>level</b> and structure <b>of</b> CEO <b>compensation.</b> My findings suggest that certain committee chair personal ties to the CEO are associated with both a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> CEO <b>compensation</b> and a higher percentage <b>of</b> CEO salary <b>compensation.</b> I also find that the more compensation committee chairs are paid, the less {{likely they are to}} create CEO pay plans with strong incentive provisions, but {{the more likely they are}} to increase the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total CEO <b>compensation.</b> The higher the committee chair’s ownership percentage is in the company, the less likely they are to create low-risk CEO pay plans, and the more likely they are to increase the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total CEO <b>compensation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{study the}} {{influence}} of monitoring by institutional investors on corporate behavior {{within the context of}} CEO compensation-based incentives. I find that institutional investors provide an executive with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> sensitivity with respect to a firm?s equity price (Delta). In contrast to prior literature, however, once I control the dynamic nature of the data, institutional investors do not affect compensation sensitivity with respect to a firm?s equity risk (Vega). Instead, I find that institutional investors appear to influence the risk profile of firm through the firm?s investment, financing and diversification policy choices even after I control for the CEO?s compensation structure. The results suggest that compensation-related incentives to increase risk (i. e. vega) and monitoring by institutional investors are substitutes of each other in that both can offset the managerial incentives to reduce risk that stem from greater <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> delta. These results are robust to potential endogeneity problems that may arise due to the dynamic nature of panel data...|$|R

40|$|Many {{individuals}} lose less {{weight than}} expected {{in response to}} exercise interventions when considering the increased energy expenditure of exercise (ExEE). This is due to energy compensation in response to ExEE, which may include increases in energy intake (EI) and decreases in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA). We examined the degree <b>of</b> energy <b>compensation</b> in healthy {{young men and women}} in response to interval training. Data were examined from a prior study in which 24 participants (mean age, BMI, & VO 2 max = 28 yrs, 27. 7 kg•m- 2, and 32 mL∙kg- 1 ∙min- 1) completed either 4 weeks of sprint-interval training or high-intensity interval training. Energy compensation was calculated from changes in body composition (air displacement plethysmography) and exercise energy expenditure was calculated from mean heart rate based on the heart rate-VO 2 relationship. Differences between high (≥ 100 %) and low (< 100 %) <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>compensation</b> were assessed. Linear regressions were utilized to determine associations between energy compensation and ΔVO 2 max, ΔEI, ΔNEPA, and Δresting metabolic rate. Very large individual differences in energy compensation were noted. In comparison to individuals with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation,</b> individuals with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>compensation</b> gained fat mass, lost fat-free mass, and had lower change scores for VO 2 max and NEPA. Linear regression results indicated that lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>compensation</b> were associated with increases in ΔVO 2 max (p < 0. 001) and ΔNEPA (p < 0. 001). Considerable variation exists in response to short-term, low dose interval training. In agreement with prior work, increases in ΔVO 2 max and ΔNEPA were associated with lower energy compensation. Future studies should focus on identifying if a dose-response relationship for energy compensation exists in response to interval training, and what underlying mechanisms and participant traits contribute to the large variation between individuals...|$|R
