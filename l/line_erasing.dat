40|$|The {{design process}} often {{begins with a}} {{graphical}} description of the proposed device or system and sketching is the physical expression of the design engineer's thinking process. Computer Aided Design is a technique in which man and machine are blended into a problem solving team, intimately coupling the best characteristics of each. Solid modelling is developed to act as the common medium between man and the computer. At present it is achieved mainly by designing with volumes and hence does not leave much room for sketching input, the traditional physical expression of the thinking process of the design engineer. This thesis describes a method of accepting isometric free hand sketching as the input to a solid model. The design engineer is allowed to make a sketch {{on top of a}} digitizer indicating (i) visible lines, (ii) hidden lines, (iii) construction lines, (iv) centre <b>lines,</b> (v) <b>erased</b> <b>lines,</b> and (vi) redundant lines as the input. The computer then processes this sketch by identifying the line segments, fitting the best possible <b>lines,</b> removing the <b>erased</b> <b>lines,</b> ignoring the redundant lines and finally merging the hidden lines and visible lines to form the lines in the solid in an interactive manner. The program then uses these lines and the information about the three dimensional origin of the object and produces three dimensional information such as the faces, loops, holes, rings, edges and vertices which are sufficient to build a solid model. This is achieved in the following manner. The points in the sketch are first written into a file. The computer than reads this file, breaks the group of points into sub-groups belonging to individual line segments, fits the best lines and identify the vertices in two dimensions. These improved lines in two dimensions are then merged to form the lines and vertices in the solid. These lines are then used together with the three dimensional origin (or any other point) to produce the wireframe model in three dimensions. The loops in the wireframe models are then identified and surface equations are fitted to these loops. Finally all the necessary inputs to build a B-rep solid model are produced. ...|$|R

Working exclusively in the medium of drawing, using a repetitive process involving meticulously and obsessively going over the same <b>lines,</b> <b>erasing</b> and redrawing with pencil to produce drawings that have the appearance of an etching, the architectural imagery on which Woodfine has concentrated since January 2001 provides a container for her ‘engineered’ drawings. The series of works started {{with the idea of a}} ready-made flat pack image, such as a scale model sold in kit form and combines this with the elevation of an architectural drawing to create a fantasy of a building using a combination of found images, photographs and detailed measurements as source material, presenting the three-dimensional in two-dimensions. ‘Chapel’ (2003) transforms the two-dimensional drawn imagery back into three-dimensions and presents the components folded, glued and presented in a perpex box in the manner of a stage-set. ‘Wyoming’ (2003), a diptych, alludes to the notion of stereoscopic vision and specifically to the way in which our eyes work together to create a reading of the three-dimensional object in space. ‘Wyoming’ was awarded the First Prize by the panel. The aim of the exhibition is to promote talent and excellence in the field of drawing in the UK. Selected from an open submission of over 2000 drawings, the work of 64 artists was selected. ‘Chapel’ (2003) was included in ‘The Real Ideal’ at the Millenium Galleries, Sheffield (2005). ‘Wyoming’ (2003) was exhibited in ‘Drawing Breath’ at the gallery at Wimbledon College of Art, which then toured to Australia, Singapore, Bristol and Aberdeen (2006 - 08) ...|$|R

In what had become a weekly event, {{controversial}} receiver Terrell Owens had a war of words {{in the days leading}} up to the game, this time against Ravens superstar linebacker Ray Lewis. The game would prove to be a battle between the dominating Philadelphia and Baltimore defenses. Almost right off the bat, Deion Sanders was hit hard by Eagles defenders as he flipped over one and was hit in midair. After getting good field position, David Akers put the Eagles up with a short field goal, but the Ravens matched that before the end of the quarter. A Donovan McNabb fumble near the Baltimore goal <b>line</b> <b>erased</b> a possible scoring chance in the second quarter, but he drove the team to a field goal on the Eagles' next possession. The defenses dominated the third quarter, and the score remained a close 6-3 as the final quarter began. Akers added a field goal early in the quarter, but the Ravens remained less than a touchdown behind. Ravens running back Chester Taylor fumbled in Eagles territory, with Hollis Thomas making the recovery. The Eagles took advantage, ending the possession in an 11-yard third down touchdown pass to Owens, who broke a tackle on his way to the score. The two-point conversion failed, but it was now 15-3 Eagles. The points proved necessary as Kyle Boller completed a touchdown to Daniel Wilcox on Baltimore's next possession. The Philadelphia defense held strong the rest of the game and the Eagles won by a final of 15-10. Owens again had over 100 yards, and scored his ninth touchdown of the year. The Eagles, at 7-0, were off to their best start ever.|$|R

40|$|For {{a source}} of Ly alpha {{radiation}} embedded in a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) prior to the reionization epoch, the emission line is strongly suppressed by the intervening IGM. The damping wing of the so-called Gunn-Peterson trough can extend to the red side of the emission <b>line,</b> and <b>erase</b> a significant {{fraction of the total}} line flux. However, the transmitted fraction increases with the size of the local cosmological HII region surrounding the source, and therefore with the ionizing luminosity and age of the source. Motivated by the recent discovery of a Ly alpha emitting galaxy at a redshift z= 6. 56 (Hu et al. 2002), possibly prior to the reionization of the IGM, we revisit the effects of a neutral IGM on the Ly alpha emission line. We show that even for faint sources with little ionizing continuum, the emission line can remain observable. In particular, the line detected by Hu et al. is consistent with a source embedded in a neutral IGM. We provide characterizations of the asymmetry and total transmitted flux of the Ly alpha line as functions of the ionizing emissivity of its source. A statistical sample of Ly alpha emitters extending beyond the reionization redshift can be a useful probe of reionization. Comment: Submitted to ApJL, 4 figures include...|$|R

Each team used their own slider to record their total score. The advantages of the Resort-type include simplicity, durable and weather proof, needs no other items such as chalk or eraser. The disadvantage is that scoring mistakes are impossible to determine, and a frames played cannot be tracked unless a separate recording method (e.g. pen and paper) is used.(2)- Blackboard (Whiteboard) Type is ruled with four or eight horizontal lines and each teams total score is written after each frame, yellow on the left and black on the right.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{clarify the}} {{mechanisms}} of left unilateral spatial neglect found in the bisection of lines after cueing to the left end point and to determine whether neglect occurs for the mental representation of a line.  METHODS—A new representational bisection task was developed to eliminate {{the influence of the}} right segment of the physical line that would attract attention. Eight patients with typical left unilateral spatial neglect underwent line and representational bisection tasks on a computer display with a touch panel. In the line bisection with cueing, they bisected a line after touching the left end point. In the representational bisection, the patients were presented with a line until they touched the left end point. On the blank display, they pointed to the subjective midpoint of the <b>erased</b> <b>line.</b> The performances of the two bisection tasks were compared when the length and position of stimulus lines were varied.  RESULTS—The rightward errors in the representational bisection were greater than or equivalent to those in the line bisection with cueing. The effect of line length in which the errors became greater for the longer lines was equally found in the line bisection with cueing and the representational bisection. This was confirmed in the condition where the right end point was placed at a fixed position and the line length was varied.  CONCLUSIONS—After cueing to the left end point, rightward bisection errors of patients with neglect are not caused by overattention to the right segment of the physical line. Left neglect occurs mainly for the mental representation formed at the time of cueing or seeing the whole extent of a line. ...|$|R

The colossal effigies of the fat women and the tuft-headed Circassian girls of cheap museums; the vistas of shabby cross streets; the survival of an old hip-roofed house here and there at their angles; the Swiss chalet, histrionic decorativeness of the stations in prospect or retrospect; the vagaries of the lines that narrowed together or stretched apart according to the width of the avenue, but always in wanton disregard of the life that dwelt, and bought and sold, and rejoiced or sorrowed, and clattered or crawled, around, below, above--were features of the frantic panorama that perpetually touched his sense of humor and moved his sympathy. Accident and then exigency seemed the forces at work to this extraordinary effect; the play of energies as free and planless as those that force the forest from the soil to the sky; and then the fierce struggle for survival, with the stronger life persisting over the deformity, the mutilation, the destruction, the decay of the weaker. The whole at moments seemed to him lawless, godless; the absence of intelligent, comprehensive purpose in the huge disorder, and the violent struggle to subordinate the result to the greater good, penetrated with its dumb appeal the consciousness {{of a man who had}} always been too self-enwrapped to perceive the chaos to which the individual selfishness must always lead.|$|R

The manuscript consists of documents written by him based on the poems he memorized and heard from his teacher. Based upon the interview with Serigne Bassirou Kane, the current owner of the material, Serigne Mbaye Diakhate used to ask his students such as Kane's father (Serigne Abdou Kane) to memorize his poems for educational purposes. Thus, the material consists of Serigne Abdou Kane's documentation of the knowledge he accumulated in his studies with Serigne Mbaye Diakhate, which he also used as educational materials for other students in his own quranic school in Khourou Mbacke. The themes addressed in the material include, among others: prayers against evil; prayers for a good rainy season and a good harvest; tributes to Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba; advice for good behavior; the importance of local values such as "jom" (honorability/determination), "fulla" (seriousness/rigor), and "kersa" (discretion); and warnings against vanity and other human flaws. The manuscripts are written on different types of paper. Most are written with black ink. Red ink is used for vocalization and to highlight key words. Some pages are not vocalized. According to Serigne Bassirou Kane, his father passed away before finishing the vocalization of some pages. Digitized on 25 July 2011. Due to the age of the documents, some pages are hard to read.
