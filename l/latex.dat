40|$|Hypothesis: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) <b>latexes</b> in nonpolar {{solvents}} are {{an excellent}} model system to understand phenomena in low dielectric media, and understanding their internal structure is critical to characterizing their performance in both fundamental studies of colloidal interactions and in potential industrial applications. Both the PMMA cores and the poly(12 -hydroxystearic acid) (PHSA) shells of the <b>latexes</b> {{are known to be}} penetrable by solvent and small molecules, but the relevance of this for the properties of these particles is unknown. Experiments: These particles can be prepared in a broad range of sizes, and two PMMA <b>latexes</b> dispersed in n-dodecane (76 and 685 nm in diameter) were studied using techniques appropriate to their size.

5|$|Lactarius nordmanensis was {{described}} by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling L.torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8μm).

40|$|Functional <b>latexes</b> with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cores and amino-containing, {{water-soluble}} polymer shells were synthesized via direct {{graft copolymerization}} of methyl methacrylate from water-soluble polymers induced {{by a small}} amount of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) at 80 degreesC for 2 h. Amphiphilic graft copolymers and PMMA homopolymers were generated concurrently to form highly monodispersed <b>latexes.</b> The effects of water-soluble polymer containing different amino group, reaction temperature, TBHP concentration, molecular weight of the polymer and pH of the solution on conversion and grafting efficiency of the monomer and particle size were investigated. Transmission electron microscopic images of the PMMA/poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and PMMA/poly(allylamine) (PAA) particles clearly show well-defined core-shell morphologies, where PMMA cores are coated with either PEI or PAA shell.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the preparation of}} surfactant-free artificial <b>latexes</b> {{on the basis of}} poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) (SMA) copolymers. The SMA copolymers were first partially alkyl-imidized and then partially ammonolyzed in acetone.

In the absence of alkyl groups the particles became completely soluble in water after a few days. The <b>latexes</b> from the partially alkyl-imidized polymer were found to remain stable at pH 2 ̆ 6 gt; 2.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} physicomechanical {{properties}} of mortar containing high volume of fly ash (FA) as partial replacement of cement in presence of copolymer <b>latexes.</b> Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0, 10, 20, 30 50, and 60 % FA. Copolymer <b>latexes</b> were used based on 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (2 -HEA) and 2 -hydroxymethylacrylate (2 -HEMA). Testing included workability, setting time, absorption, chemically combined water content, compressive strength, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The addition of FA to mortar as replacement of PC affected the physicomechanical properties of mortar. As the content of FA in the concrete increased, the setting times (initial and final) were elongated. The results obtained at 28 days of curing indicate that the maximum properties of mortar occur at around 30 % FA. Beyond 30 % FA the properties of mortar reduce and at 60 % FA the properties of mortar are {{lower than those of}} the reference mortar without FA. However, the addition of polymer <b>latexes</b> into mortar containing FA improved most of the physicomechanical properties of mortar at all curing times. Compressive strength, combined water, and workability of mortar containing FA premixed with <b>latexes</b> are higher than those of mortar containing FA without <b>latexes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance.

40|$|The {{combination}} {{of the characteristics of}} oil, or alkyd, emulsions and acrylic <b>latexes</b> in a waterborne binder has been the object of various studies in the past. Strategies for combining the positive properties of alkyds, e. g. autoxidative curing, gloss and penetration in wood, with the fast drying and gloss and color retention properties of acrylic <b>latexes</b> have mainly been directed towards the modification of the alkyd with an acrylate during alkyd synthesis followed by emulsification. This paper describes the preparation and application of oil-acrylic hybrid <b>latexes</b> as binders for waterborne coatings. The hybrid <b>latexes</b> were prepared using hydroperoxidized triglycerides as initiators for the mini-emulsion polymerization of acrylates in an Fe(II) /EDTA/SFS redox system. The particle morphology of hybrids initiated by fatty-acid hydroperoxides was compared with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated systems. Cryo-TEM analysis indicated that, whereas tert-butyl hydroperoxide initiation resulted in the formation of heterogeneous particles, fatty-acid hydroperoxide-initiated hybrid particles showed no intra-particle heterogeneity. An AFM study of the film formation process of the oil/alkyd-acrylic hybrid <b>latexes</b> showed that phase separation occurred between the oil and the acrylic phases upon drying, resulting in films that consist of deformed acrylic particles embedded in a continuous matrix of oil. This results in a very smooth surface of the film...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} heterogeneous <b>latexes,</b> which may serve as binders in coating applications, and the characterization of these. The <b>latexes</b> were prepared in two-stage seeded emulsion polymerization. The seed <b>latexes</b> used were polystyrene, whose properties had been changed by copolymerization with methacrylic acid (MAA) or divinyl benzene. The second-stage polymers were copolymers of styrene-co-isoprene-co-MAA or styrene-co-butadiene-co-MAA with varying compositions. The monomers in {{the second stage of}} polymerization were added either as a batch, or as a semi-continuous operation during the whole of the second stage or during various periods. The hydrophilicity of the polymeric phases was found to affect the particle morphology to a great extent. It was possible to change the particle morphology from an inverted core-shell to a core-shell morphology simply by adding small amounts of MAA to the monomer mixture used in the second stage of polymerization. Crosslinking of the seed particles had an even stronger effect on the morphology development. Increased amounts of isoprene and MAA, as well as an increased phase ratio between the second-stage polymer and the seed was found to increase deviations between particle sizes obtained by TEM and QELS. Monomer swelling experiments showed {{that it was possible to}} estimate the monomer volume fraction at which the seed polymer glass transition temperature (Tg) and the so-called gel point occurred, through pressure measurements. When the pressure was monitored in the copolymerization of butadiene and styrene, the conversion at which crosslinking began was detected as an irregularity on the pressure curve plotted as a function of the second-stage monomer conversion. Films made from the heterogeneous <b>latexes</b> were found to consist of two phases with the hard seed particles remaining as particles within the films. Mechanical measurements on the films showed that films made from <b>latexes</b> with crosslinked seed particles having irregular shapes, had the highest mechanical strength due to inter-particle contacts. Films made from <b>latexes</b> with core-shell morphologies exhibited lower mechanical strength due to the smooth seed particle structures left in the film. When <b>latexes</b> with crosslinked seed particles of irregular shapes were used as binders in model paper coating applications, they increased the porosity, gave greater light scattering ability and higher coating gloss of the coating layer, compared with <b>latexes</b> having core shell morphologies, due to retarded shrinkage of the coating during drying...|$|R

The reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process was used in the miniemulsion polymerization reactions to control the molecular weight distribution.
