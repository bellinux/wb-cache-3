5000|$|<b>Lexical</b> <b>development</b> {{does not}} occur in isolation. [...] Children learn pronunciations, {{meanings}} {{and how to use}} words from interactions with their parents and environment (i.e. social interactions). The process moves from using words in particular situation to the understanding that words can be used to refer to different instances of conceptual categories, which means objects, or action words can be used in similar situations. [...] After this step, children increase their vocabulary in categories like color, animal, or food, and learn to add prefixes and suffixes to and meaning to words. [...] Once children enter school, they develop words into reading and written aspects. Knowledge will be developed by reading and exposure to various written context.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lexical</b> <b>development</b> in {{children}} who learn their second language when their first language is already developed {{is different from that}} of children who grow up in a bilingual environment (i.e. simultaneous bilingualism). The beginning step of learning words in the second language is translation, or learning the definitions. This is different from how they learned their first language which involves inputting the information of semantic and formal entities together. [...] When accessing these newly learned words, the basic language semantic system will be activated, which means when a second language word is activated, the basic language word with the same meaning is also activated. It can be said that learners are still thinking in basic language but try to represent in second language by translation as more semantic and syntax knowledge is learned for the second language. This new language is gradually independent from the basic language. Learners began to access the language without translation with semantic knowledge for that language. As learns gain more and more exposure to the new language, they will complete the development of second language when they can access and use the language from the concept, which can be said to be thinking in that language directly.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{longitudinally}} gestural and vocal coordination in multimodal communicative patterns during the period of transition to first words, and its role in early <b>lexical</b> <b>development.</b> Eleven monolingual Spanish children were observed from 9 to 12 and 15 months of age in a semistructured play situation. We obtained three main findings: (1) the use of multimodal patterns of communication increases significantly with age during the period studied; (2) the rate of use of those multimodal patterns at 12 months predicts <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> at 15 months; and (3) the use of the pointing gesture at 12 months, especially when it is accompanied with vocalization and social use of gaze, is the best predictor of lexical outcome at 15 months. Our findings support the idea that gestures, gazes and vocalizations are part of an integrated and developing system that children use flexibly to communicate from early on.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Social {{conversational}} {{skills are}} a salient aspect of early pragmatic development in young children. These skills include two different abilities, assertiveness and responsiveness. This {{study investigated the}} development of these abilities in early implanted children and their relationships with <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> and some language-sensitive variables. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational, nonrandomized study. METHODS: Participants included 28 children with congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss. The mean age at device activation was 13. 3 months (standard deviation [SD] ± 4. 2). The Social-Conversational Skills Rating Scale was used to evaluate assertiveness and responsiveness. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Words and Sentences form) was used to analyze the <b>lexical</b> <b>development.</b> The device experience was 12 months for each child, and the mean age at testing was 25. 9 months (SD ± 4. 6). RESULTS: Assertiveness and responsiveness scores were within the normal range of normal-hearing age-matched peers. Age at cochlear implant activation exerted a significant impact, with the highest scores associated to the youngest patients. The residual correlations between assertiveness and responsiveness with the <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> were positive and strongly significant (r = 0. 69 and 0. 73, respectively). Preoperative hearing threshold demonstrated an associated significant coefficient on the assertiveness score. Age at diagnosis and maternal education level were not correlated with the social conversational skills. CONCLUSIONS: Early-implanted children developed social conversational skills that are similar to normal-hearing peers matched for age 1 year after device activation. Social conversational skills and <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> were strongly correlated, but the present study design cannot specify the direction of this relationship. Children with better preoperative residual hearing exhibited better assertive ability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Language Development Survey (LDS) {{was used}} to compare Italian and English <b>lexical</b> <b>development.</b> We {{addressed}} the issue of universal versus language-specific aspects of <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> by testing language, age, and gender effects on vocabulary scores and by comparing vocabulary composition across languages. We addressed the issue of delay versus deviance by comparing vocabulary composition in late talkers and younger vocabulary size-matched children. Methods: Participants were 398 Italian and 206 U. S children ages 18 - 35 months. Results: Vocabulary size did not differ significantly by language, and age and gender effects on vocabulary size were not moderated by language. The Italian-English Q correlation for percentage word use scores was. 55, lower than within-language concordance of >. 90. Cross-linguistic concordance declined as age and vocabulary size increased. Many cross-linguistic word matches (63 words) were found among the “top 100 ” words. Italian late talkers were similar to younger vocabulary size-matched Italian children in vocabulary composition, consistent with findings for English, Greek, and Korean. Conclusions: In both languages, the early lexicons of late talkers and typical talkers contained many of the same words, indicating considerable universality in young children’s <b>lexical</b> <b>development.</b> These common words are therefore good targets for clinical intervention...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{consists}} of two different studies. First, it resumes the discussion about matar and its derivatives that has lasted for centuries. Rematar y arrematar are different verbs, but its usage is almost the same.

(A) rrematar has <b>lexical</b> <b>developments</b> in Jewish-Spanish, Old Spanish and Modern Spanish in dialectal areas. Secondly, this essay deals with the problem posed by menudencia in Spanish and miudeza in Portuguese. In {{spite of the fact that}} menudencia does not pose etymological problems, the origin of the Portuguese term miudu (related to miudeza) is surprising. It is also exceptional that the suffix -eza, typical of the Western parts of the Peninsula, should correspond to -encia in the Central region. Around 1400 both the norm of compatibility and the coincidence of d and z were altered (as in menud- and menuz-) and this circumstance led the speaker to coin a new abstract term in order to match menud-o in Spanish (and meúdo, miúdo in Portughese). Since -encia in Spanish and -eza in Portuguese were in vogue at the beginning of the fifteenth century, the speakers constructed menudencia and miud-eza, though there remained traces of this dual operation of composition...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} neurocomputational model with {{self-organizing}} maps {{that accounts for}} the emergence of taxonomic responding and fast mapping in early word learning, as well as a rapid increase in the rate of acquisition of words observed in late infancy. The quality and efficiency of generalization of word-object associations {{is directly related to the}} quality of prelexical, categorical representations in the model. We show how synaptogenesis supports coherent generalization of word-object associations and show that later synaptic pruning minimizes metabolic costs without being detrimental to word learning. The role played by joint-attentional activities is identified in the model, both at the level of selecting efficient cross-modal synapses and at the behavioral level, by accelerating and refining overall vocabulary acquisition. The model can account for the qualitative shift in the way infants use words, from an associative to a referential-like use, for the pattern of overextension errors in production and comprehension observed during early childhood and typicality effects observed in <b>lexical</b> <b>development.</b> Interesting by-products of the model include a potential explanation of the shift from prototype to exemplar-based effects reported for adult category formation, an account of mispronunciation effects in early <b>lexical</b> <b>development,</b> and extendability to include accounts of individual differences in <b>lexical</b> <b>development</b> and specific disorders such as Williams syndrome.
