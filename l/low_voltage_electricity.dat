The significant importance of the website RES LEGAL [1] (Legal sources on Renewable Energy), an initiative of the European Commission, has to be acknowledged. The information provided in the website of RES LEGAL acted as an important starting point during the process of searching the relevant legislative documents of DSOs regarding the situation for single phase (1 Φ) RES penetration (kWp) and single phase (1 Φ) contracted power (kVA) levels in the EU member states. The ratio of installed single phase (1 Φ) PV capacity (kWp) over the single phase (1 Φ) contracted power (kVA) of a consumer is of importance when planning the penetration of RES to the electricity distribution system in the member states of the EU. For the majority of the member states this ratio is explicitly stated in relevant legislative documents. In case of lack of explicit definition of a coefficient that relates maximum allowable RES power injection (kWp) with contracted power (kVA) levels at the consumption side, this ratio can be calculated.

40|$|If the Netherlands {{wishes to}} achieve an 80 % CO 2 {{reduction}} by the year 2050, technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles {{will be required to}} replace their fossil fuel burning counterparts. These technologies however have large consequences for electricity networks; not only will the amount of electricity transported over the networks increase, but so will the peak loads, pushing transformers and cables to their operating limits. This is a challenge that network operators are currently facing, and new methods are required to help them prepare for the future. In this thesis the flexibility of future energy technologies with the goal of limiting network loads in the Dutch <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>electricity</b> grid is investigated. ‘Flexibility’ refers to different variations, control strategies, and combinations of technologies that exist. Focus is placed on eight electric vehicle charging strategies and five types of electric heat pumps. Solar photovoltaics, electric hot water boilers, micro CHPs, and electric heaters as well as the effect of household insulation and thermostat setting are also investigated. The impact on the electricity grid is quantified by creating a testing environment in which the load of transformers and cables can be easily determined for any combination of market penetrations of the above technologies. Three representative low voltage networks are considered: A city, a village, and a countryside neighborhood. Calculations are carried out for a typical summer and winter day with 15 minute intervals. The technologies are modeled as Strand-Axelsson loads to take into account simultaneousness and accurately be able to predict the peak load of any number of users. The testing environment is validated by comparing the results to those obtained by Gaia, a software package specifically designed for carrying out electricity network calculations. Power demand profiles for all technologies are created using different modeling strategies. The electric vehicles are modeled based on mobility data of 50. 000 Dutch citizens. Eight control strategies are modeled, examples are: uncontrolled charging, night time charging, and vehicle to grid. To model space heating technologies a Matlab model has been constructed that accurately predicts the heat demand of a household taking into account factors such as household type, insulation, thermostat setting, and outdoor temperature. With the model the power demand profiles of heat pumps and other heaters are created by modeling their control strategies. The electric vehicle and heat pump profiles are verified by comparing the results to measured data obtained from Alliander. The power demand profiles are entered into the testing environment and simulations are carried out. The impact of each technology on transformer and cable loads is quantified and the effects of flexibility are investigated. It is found that uncontrolled use of heat pumps and electric vehicles present problems for the electricity network: market penetrations as low as 20 % could cause transformer loads to reach values above 100 %. Flexibility options however do exist and can be used effectively to limit network loads. Electric vehicles offer the most flexibility since the charging times are the easiest to control. Heating technologies have limited flexibility but improving household insulation and using the right thermostat settings can reduce network loads. Micro CHPs combine very well with other technologies and can be very effective at limiting the loads caused by both electric vehicles and heat pumps.

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} focused on {{conducted}} emission (up to 150 kHz) from common lowvoltage appliances. The emphasis has been on equipment that contributes to a sustainable energy system: photovoltaic (PV) installations and energy-saving lamps (LED lamps). The frequency components present in the grid {{in addition to the}} fundamental 50 Hz component can be divided into harmonics (up to 2 kHz in a 50 Hz system) and supraharmonics (2 kHz to 150 kHz). These frequency components are partly the effect of normal operation of equipment due to power-electronic converters and the switching technique used. Power line communication, PLC, is an important source of frequency components in the range 9 to 95 kHz. Even though from an equipment viewpoint there is no difference between a signal used for communication and a signal that is a residue from a switching circuit, PLC is a useful signal for operation of the grid and for communication with electricity meters. The amplitude of the communication signal is in in almost all cases higher than the emission from any other equipment connected to the grid. Understanding the different types of interaction between PLC and end-user equipment has been a major part of this work. Five types of interaction have been identified; some negative for PLC, some negative for end-user equipment. An important conclusion from this part of the work is that loss of communication with PLC, as is often reported with remote reading of electricity meters, is not due to emission by end-user equipment but due to the EMC filter of the end-user equipment providing a low-impedance path. The understandings acquired from the work with PLC have been applied to other types of emission as well. Supraharmonics from individual devices, above about 10 kHz, flow mainly to neighboring devices, not into the grid. This behavior was found by laboratory experiments and confirmed by other studies as well. A circuit-theory model has been developed that explains this behavior. The EMC filters are shown to be the main cause of this behavior. Other configurations of those filters may result in a larger flow of emission towards the grid. One type of appliance that has been introduced recently is the LED lamp. LED lamps come in different designs with different emission spectra. A possible distinction is between lamps with high levels of low-order harmonics (up to a few 100 Hz) and those with high levels of supraharmonics. Restricting the emission in the lower frequency range, through standardization, could result in higher distortion levels at higher frequencies. Replacement of incandescent lamps by CLF and LED lamps is not expected to result in a noticeable increase in harmonic voltage and current levels in the grid. This has been shown through several laboratory experiments and field experiments. Emission from PV inverters is low at low-order harmonics, this have been shown by a number of measurements both on single phase connected installations, so called rooftop installations and larger, three phase connected installations (20 kW). In addition to emission in the low frequency range, PV inverters emit at their switching frequency, e. g. around 16 kHz. The emission at this frequency is shown to vary by a factor of 5 or more, depending on the presence of neighboring equipment. This was shown by measurements and has been explained by a circuit-theory model. This thesis work has resulted in further understanding on the emission from PV panels and energy-saving lamps and on the propagation of conducted emission from common household appliances. This work is an important contribution to the research on distortion of voltage and current in the frequency range 2 to 150 kHz.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{distributed}} renewable energy supply sources and storage systems has placed {{a greater degree}} of focus on the operations of the <b>Low</b> <b>Voltage</b> (LV) <b>electricity</b> distribution network. However, LV networks are characterised by having much higher variability in time series demand meaning that modelling techniques solely relying on iterative forecasts to produce a next day demand profile forecast are insufficient. To cater for the complexity of LV network demand, a novel hybrid expert system comprised of three modules, namely, correlation clustering, discrete classification neural network, and a post-processing procedure was developed. The system operates by classifying a set of key variables associated with a future day and refining a recalled historical demand profile as the forecast. The expert system exhibited high hindcast accuracy when trained with a residential LV transformer's demand data with R 2 values ranging from 0. 86 to 0. 87 and MAPE ranging from 11 % to 12 % across the three phases of the network. Under simulated real world conditions the R 2 statistic reduced slightly to 0. 81 - 0. 84 and the MAPE increased to 12. 5 - 13. 5 %. Future work will involve integrating the developed expert system for forecasting next day demand in an LV network into a comprehensive distributed energy resource management algorithm.

When used on a wide-scale, low-carbon technologies, including domestic scale micro-generation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and flexible demand, will {{change the nature of}} domestic electricity use. In providing a basis for the quantification of the impact upon distribution networks, this thesis details the construction and use of a high-resolution integrated model that simulates both existing domestic <b>electricity</b> use and <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution networks. <b>Electricity</b> demand is modelled at the level of individual household appliances and is based upon surveyed occupant time-use data. This approach results in a simulation that exhibits realistic time-variant demand characteristics, in both individual dwellings, as well as, groups of dwellings together. Validation is performed against real domestic electricity use data, measured for this purpose, from dwellings in Loughborough in the East Midlands, UK. The <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution network is modelled using real network data, and the output of its simulation is validated against measured network voltages and power demands.

40|$|With a large {{penetration}} of low carbon technologies (LCTs) at medium <b>voltage</b> and <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> levels, <b>electricity</b> distribution networks are undergoing rapid changes. Much {{research has been}} carried out to analyse the impact of employing LCTs in distribution networks based on either real or synthetic network samples. Results of such studies are usually case specific and of limited applicability to other networks. Topological properties of a distribution networks describe how different network components are located and connected, which are critical for the investigation of network performance. However, the number of network modelling and simulation platforms are limited in the open literature which can provide random realistic representations of electricity distribution networks. Thus, it is difficult to arrive to generalized and robust conclusions on impact studies of LCTs. As the initial step to bridge this gap, this paper studies the topological properties of real-world electricity distribution networks at the medium voltage level by employing the techniques from complex networks analysis and graph theory. The networks have been modelled as graphs with nodes representing electrical components of the network and links standing for the connections between the nodes through distribution lines. The key topological properties that characterize different types (urban and sub-urban) of distribution networks have been identified and quantified. A novel approach to obtain depth-dependent topological properties has also been developed. Results show that the node degree and edge length related graph properties are a key to characterize different types of electricity distribution networks and depth dependent network properties are able to better characterize the topological properties of urban and sub-urban networks...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Assessing the impact of domestic low-carbon technologies on the electricity distribution network requires a detailed insight into the operation of networks and the power demands of consumers. When used on a wide-scale, low-carbon technologies, including domestic scale micro-generation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and flexible demand, will {{change the nature of}} domestic electricity use. In providing a basis for the quantification of the impact upon distribution networks, this thesis details the construction and use of a high-resolution integrated model that simulates both existing domestic <b>electricity</b> use and <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution networks. <b>Electricity</b> demand is modelled at the level of individual household appliances and is based upon surveyed occupant time-use data. This approach results in a simulation that exhibits realistic time-variant demand characteristics, in both individual dwellings, as well as, groups of dwellings together. Validation is performed against real domestic electricity use data, measured for this purpose, from dwellings in Loughborough in the East Midlands, UK. The <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> distribution network is modelled using real network data, and the output of its simulation is validated against measured network voltages and power demands. The integrated model provides a highly detailed insight into the operation of networks at a one-minute resolution. This integrated model is the main output of this research, alongside published articles and a freely downloadable software implementation of the demand model...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaics (PV) {{have seen}} rapid global {{penetration}} into the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> (LV) <b>electricity</b> distribution grid year-on-year. The result of high PV penetration levels is grid impacts of voltage fluctuations, harmonic distortions and reverse flow among others. Research {{that attempts to}} quantify the maximum allowable PV penetration into the LV grid before experiencing detrimental impacts is an important. The most commonly reported barrier to enabling grid impact analysis is the lacking availability of high-resolution and geographically flexible solar irradiance data. As an alternative, synthetically generated solar irradiance data can be used. There is a distinct lack of synthetic solar irradiance generators that can derive high resolution and statistically accurate solar irradiance data using only readily available inputs. This thesis presents the development of two synthetic generators: the Solar Irradiance Generator (SIG), and the Spatially Decorrelating Solar Irradiance Generator (SDSIG). The SIG proves the concept that synthetic minutely irradiance time series can be generated using readily available mean hourly observations of total cloud amount, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and cloud base height. The SDSIG presents the first ever methodology to synthetically generate unique and spatially decorrelating minutely irradiance time series {{for any number of}} uniquely orientated and tilted houses inside a spatial domain using the same inputs as the SIG. The SDSIG employs (1) Markov chains, to derive stochastic weather variable time series, (2) synthetic representations of clouds in the sky, using a novel method called cloud fields, (3) globally flexible irradiance estimation models, and (4) distributions of clear-sky irradiance by total cloud amount, to create the irradiance time series. The SDSIG outputs are temporally validated using metrics of ramp rates, variability indices and irradiance magnitude frequencies against real world observations at two UK sites and two USA sites, representing three distinct climates. Daily 2 -sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of each metric passed a minimum of 95. 34...|$|R
