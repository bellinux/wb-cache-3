500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, and you could <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> But {{there was always something}} there to back you off." [...] Former Padres player Garry Templeton said that he might have been Wiggins' closest friend, but he said {{that he did not know}} that Wiggins had been ill.|$|E
500|$|McCain also harshly criticized Obama for {{scrapping}} {{construction of}} the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar {{to what he had}} proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, [...] "A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> blowing up the bridges." ...|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E

50|$|Wang said:There's {{this idea}} that hip-hop has to have street credibility, yet the first big hip-hop song was an inauthentic fabrication. It's not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> {{involved}} were <b>the</b> 'real' hip-hop icons of <b>the</b> era, <b>like</b> Grandmaster Flash or Lovebug Starski. So it's a pretty impressive fabrication, lightning in a bottle.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} movie [...] (3 out of 4 stars) and stated that, [...] "Somehow Kevin Smith's very excesses defuse the material. He's <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> {{at a party}} who tells dirty jokes so fast, Dangerfield-style, that you laugh more at the {{performance}} than the material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker {{considered}} Buscemi miscast as {{the central}} figure in the drama. [...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusics Jared Johnson {{said that}} the album title [...] "is {{a line in the}} {{infectious}} track [...] "The More," [...] referring to the awe with which we look at God." [...] Johnson called the album a [...] "masterly crafted melodic rock." [...] Johnson evoked that [...] "the theme is uplifting, but you never feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> are talking down to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept for}} 'Build or Bust' was that host and custom {{motorcycle}} builder Russell Mitchell {{took in a}} member of the public who thought {{it would be easy to}} build a bike [...] "just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> on TV." [...] Russell gave <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> (or girl) access to all the tools and parts necessary to make a custom motorcycle, allowing the contestant one month to assemble it. If at the end of that time the contestant built a bike that met Russell's standards, they get to keep it. If they didn't, they lost the motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|Woody and Winnie {{make it to}} {{the sock}} hop, where they hear a singer sing. Winnie <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy's</b> singing, but Woody does not care for it. As Woody and Winnie dance, Buzz shows up and succeeds in {{disposing}} of Woody. The buzzard then takes Winnie to a drive-in restaurant to buy her a soda and a banana split for himself. Woody, dressed as a waitress, gives Buzz an explosive banana split. The two begin to fight once again, only to find Winnie riding away with the singer from the sock hop.|$|R
2500|$|As a commentator, Miller {{became known}} for his {{straightforward}} and sometimes blunt remarks, which sometimes earned him the enmity of players. One example came on June 16, 2008, when he referred to Rocco Mediate, during the broadcast of the U.S. Open's 18-hole playoff, as [...] "looking <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who cleans Tiger Woods' pool." [...] Miller said that [...] "guys {{with the name of}} Rocco don't get on the trophy, do they?" [...] Mediate, who has battled many physical problems throughout his career, nevertheless played superbly, and took the heavily favored Woods to an 18-hole playoff (and one extra sudden-death hole) before losing. Mediate later laughed off the remarks and Miller later apologized for his comments, saying: [...] "I chose my words poorly and in the future will be more careful." [...] He added that his intention was to [...] "convey my affection and admiration for Rocco's everyman qualities and had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} his heritage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interplay {{actually}} {{wants to}} do the game right! We've been talking about a game now for two years. They {{want me to be}} involved, but times in games are tough right now for everyone. They have to raise {{a lot of money to}} fund the game properly... In our early discussions about the game, we had tentatively brainstormed ideas for the Wii. That is NOT a confirmation <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> posted. We haven't presented the idea to Nintendo... As with anything in the gaming industry, the whole thing could turn on a dime and many of the facts can change about the game. What these fans don’t understand is how squirly things are at the beginning of the game. It would take at least two years to bring out the game and that’s after we’ve confirmed the budget and platform. The game could just as easily go away, get moved to the iPhone or become a Jim Tetris knock off as come out as a game on the Wii. People don’t understand how unstable game design is at the start" ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E
5000|$|The video {{begins with}} Dave and Charles {{talking about what}} they did the night before. Feeling left out Hillary wants them to take her {{out on the town}} later that night but they {{disagree}} saying she is too much of a goody two-shoes who would rather watch romcoms. In order to prove that she can have fun <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> Hillary calls Beth Behrs to see if she wants {{to go out on the}} town and [...] "get so crazy they get arrested". Beth assures her that when they hang out together they can.|$|R
500|$|According to The Portland Mercury Marjorie Skinner, [...] "Though the {{cocktail}} menu is as fancy as the next, the bar staff is unfussy and approachable, and food {{prices for the}} most part steer well clear of the $20 mark—downright cheap eats compared {{to the rest of the}} neighborhood." [...] In her book, Food Lovers' Guide to Portland, Oregon: The Best Restaurants, Markets and Local Culinary Offerings (2014), Laurie Wolf wrote: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Parish. I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> who own it, Tobias Hogan and Ethan Powell. For the Pearl neighborhood the prices are super reasonable and the small menu certainly delivers the best of the offerings." ...|$|R

5000|$|When Berg, Rico {{and fellow}} editor Ernie Hart moved on, {{later in the}} 1940s, Lazarus worked as an {{assistant}} to Al Jaffee, who came in as editor of the teen-humor line. As cartoonist and comics commentator Fred Hembeck observed, [...] "Leon read through all the submissions, weeding out the junk and only passing on the worthwhile material to Jaffee; and Leon had mastered the ability to improve a six-pager with just a few judicious edits. Plus, Al really <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> Basically, Jaffee found him indispensable". Among the writers with whom Lazarus worked as an editor as Patricia Highsmith, the future novelist, whose early career included writing romance comics for Timely/Atlas.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, it was {{reported}} Wale {{was working on a}} new album, titled The Album About Nothing with Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld spoke about how the collaboration came to be, saying: [...] "Wale called me, came to my show and we hung out a little bit. He wanted me to do something with him. I didn't understand it, but he did and then I kind of <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> I dug <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> and I listened to his music, I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> music. So I said alright, I'll do it, even though I didn't know what I was going to do. So I said to my wife, 'I'm doing this thing with this guy Wale' and she said, 'Wale is my favorite Hip Hop artist. I have every single thing.' Somehow, she missed anything {{that had to do with}} me, but has every other cut, everything else he's done.
