5000|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Square D sold the {{majority}} of their fuse business in order to focus more on their <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> and other <b>safety</b> products. The company began an aggressive marketing campaign to promote their <b>safety</b> <b>switches.</b> Their advertisements, which became to be known as [...] "Jones is Dead!", directed public attention to the safety hazards of exposed electrical switches in factories. Square D hoped to capitalize on the growing concern of factory safety. One such fully working Square D <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> from 1922 was donated in November 2003 to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.|$|R

40|$|DE 102008063976 A 1 UPAB: 20100712 NOVELTY - The switch (100) has {{a housing}} (101) fixed {{in a vacuum}} chamber such that {{pressure}} within the chamber acts on a compensator pipe (104) and on a flexible membrane. A form or position of the pipe and membrane is changeable in dependence of the pressure. A contactless-detection is made whether deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches a desired value, using a commercial <b>safety</b> magnet <b>switch</b> (107). The magnet switch actuates a switching contact or produces a signal when the deformation or position change of the pipe and the membrane reaches the value. USE - Pressure <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> for a vacuum chamber that is utilized for coating substrates. ADVANTAGE - The switch is designed such that electrical components provided downstream to the <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> are reliably switched at zero voltage while opening the vacuum chamber. The <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> is suitable to standard-conform for application in safety-relevant functions...|$|R
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> on the slide. The ambidextrous <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded on December 15, 1902 by Bryson Dexter Horton and James B. McCarthy. In 1903 they {{incorporated}} as the McBride Manufacturing Company. During {{the first decade of}} business, the company expanded into various other electrical products. In 1908, the company was renamed Detroit Fuse and Manufacturing. Horton, an 1895 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, was credited with the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>switch,</b> which encased high voltage switches and started the company's main line of business of circuit breakers and encased control panels. Their first enclosed <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> was introduced in 1909.|$|R

When pulled back, the liner lock can easily be pushed back to close the knife. But when the <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> is pushed forward, it acts as an extra lock ensuring the linerlock {{can not be used to}} close the knife, making the folding knife a virtual fixed-blade tool.|$|R
