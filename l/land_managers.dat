5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some <b>land</b> <b>managers</b> to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Climbing {{can also}} {{interfere}} with raptor nesting {{since the two}} activities often {{take place on the}} same precipitous cliffs.

25|$|Fire suppression, in {{combination}} with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but climate change is more likely responsible. <b>Land</b> <b>managers</b> are faced with tough questions regarding how to restore a natural fire regime, but allowing wildfires to burn is the least expensive and likely most effective method.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{theories}} about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by <b>land</b> <b>managers.</b> For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions. Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations. Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{tropical}} forest in particular {{needs to be}} studied extensively {{because it is a}} highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples. [...] The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current <b>land</b> <b>managers</b> in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production. <b>Land</b> <b>managers</b> no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Land</b> <b>managers,</b> laypeople, and {{stewards}} {{have been}} practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for many hundreds, if not thousands, of years, yet the scientific field of [...] "restoration ecology" [...] was not first formally identified and coined {{until the late}} 1980s, by John Aber and William Jordan when {{they were at the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison. Around this time environmental disasters caused by industry were taking place motivating people toward restoration. They held the first international meetings on this topic in Madison during which attendees visited the University of Wisconsin's Arboretumâ€”the oldest restoration ecology project made famous by Professor Aldo Leopold. The study of restoration ecology has only become a robust and independent scientific discipline over the last two decades, and the commercial applications of ecological restoration have tremendously increased in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Historical ecology {{involves}} {{an understanding of}} multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, {{and the impact of}} human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines. [...] Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid <b>land</b> <b>managers</b> by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.|$|E
2500|$|The John Day/Clarno Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by moderately to highly dissected hills and low mountains that are uniformly covered by Western ponderosa pine forest with a grass and shrub understory. Elevation varies from 3,000to6,200feet (914to1,990m). The region includes broad streams fed more by springs than by snow melt. The continental climate is tempered by a marine influence; {{it is not as}} dry, nor are temperature extremes as great, as in the Continental Zone Highlands. Historically, frequent low intensity wildfires reduced fuel loading in forests of widely spaced old-growth ponderosa pine. Today, after years of fire suppression and high grade logging, <b>land</b> <b>managers</b> attempt to emulate historical fire regimes to reverse the trend toward dense thickets of young growth that carry hot, stand-replacing fires. Potential vegetation is mostly open ponderosa pine, with some Douglas-fir, western juniper, mountain-mahogany, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support grand fir, mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, ninebark, Wood's rose, Rocky Mountain maple, and willows. The region covers [...] in Oregon, including parts of the Ochoco, Malheur, and Umatilla national forests and lower elevations in the Mill Creek, Bridge Creek, Black Canyon and North Fork John Day wilderness areas.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Land</b> <b>managers</b> and conservationists {{have become}} {{increasingly}} interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned. [...] As a result, {{it is important to}} understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change. [...] Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat, conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements. [...] Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat. [...] Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there. [...] Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances. [...] Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction. [...] For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.|$|E

Alan Watson Featherstone, of Trees For Life endorsed the cover with 'this book offers a beacon of hope to all those who draw spiritual sustenance from wild Nature' and Professor Bill Adams, at Cambridge University, also endorsing the cover said 'Peter Taylor builds bridges between ecology, countryside policy and spirituality'. In networking ecological practitioners and <b>land</b> <b>managers,</b> Taylor worked to construct a political strategy for rewilding conservation through regional seminars, national conferences and in 2008, his colleague in the network Steve Carver founded the Wildland Research Institute at Leeds University.|$|E
