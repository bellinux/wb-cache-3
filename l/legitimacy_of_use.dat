40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Responsibility to protect principle as the paradigm that reinforces the just war {{theory in the}} current international relations. The importance of this analysis is given {{by the fact that}} in the current change of source of international conflicts, the Responsibility to protect principle affirms the responsibility of the international community to protect all the citizens of the world. In this context we witness a translation toward a Post-Westphalian international system, which values the individual as a security referent. This article discusses the origins of the responsibility to protect principle and problematizes (discusses) the <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of violence and force in the current international system. Moreover, the paper {{analyzes the}} possible humanization of the current international relations and, simultaneously, the persistency of conflict and warfare in the international system.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} influences {{and experiences of}} use of a UK Independent Cancer Support Services (ICSS), {{with a focus on}} how its use corresponds with the attempts of cancer patients and their families to manage the psychosocial impact of cancer. Method: A case study approach was used to investigate use of an ICSS providing counselling, complementary and creative therapies to cancer patients, families and carers. ICSS clients (17), non-clients (7) and therapists (6) took part in semi- structured interviews discussing influences on and experiences of use of the service. Interviews were analysed using thematic and narrative analytic approaches. Findings: Clients' experiences of the ICSS appeared to centre around a sense of sanctuary and emotional support, arising from a 'safe' opportunity to talk {{in a way that is}} under clients' control and through an ethos and atmosphere which conveys a sense of value and personal control over therapy. These experiences often did not reflect clients' initial reasons for coming to the service, which suggested more varied approaches, with many clients initially reporting problem-solving reasons for coming. Barriers to use of the service included concerns about <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of the service, especially from family/carers, and discomfort with the emotional support-based ethos of the service. Discussion and Conclusion: Although the predominant experience of the ICSS was one of emotional support, many clients seemed initially reluctant I unable to identify a need for such support. I suggest that the ICSS provides an environment and relationships which enable clients to feel more comfortable with this kind of support. The use of an ICSS is a nuanced and dynamic process reflecting the shifting and multi-faceted nature of the psychosocial impact of cancer and the complex discourses regarding how to manage it.

40|$|The {{question}} of what constitutes the <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> force targeting an external adversary, has become especially relevant since the wars that followed the 9 / 11 events and the post-Cold War’s interventions in human crises. However, international relations is the main field in which this issue is discussed while political scientists tend to mix legitimacy with supportive public opinion. This paper is conceptually motivated. It begins by defining the concept <b>of</b> the <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> force. It then analyzes the two components of this legitimacy: the first represents the constant, socially constructed component, {{and the second is}} a dynamic component, on which the paper focuses.

This note does not quarrel with the <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> such a technique for capturing household marginal willingness to pay for crime avoidance. Instead, it focuses on two questions about how Rizzo used the technique. First, should income be used, even as a proxy for other variables, in estimating an essentially reduced form equation which relates housing characteristics (quantity measurements) to their implicit prices? Second, if a liberal estimate of the value of crime avoidance is generated, why not a conservative one also...|$|R

Critical Discourse Analysis is employed to identify the arguments, evidence and experience drawn upon in the negotiation of the topic. We identify an important distinction between the <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> ART procedures for social sex selection, and the appropriateness of individuals actually wanting to use the procedures. We further show that expectations about the parent/child relationship, the nature of parental love and implications for society are mobilized in the debate, much of which is underscored by traditional gender constructions...|$|R

40|$|By most {{objective}} {{measures the}} lives of women in the United States have improved over the past 35 years, yet we show that measures of subjective well-being indicate that women’s happiness has declined both absolutely and relative to male happiness. The paradox of women’s declining relative well-being is found examining multiple countries, datasets, and measures of subjective well-being, and is pervasive across demographic groups. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970 s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging—one with higher subjective well-being for men.

30|$|Although {{the study}} was made to {{estimate}} the economic value of groundwater protection from pollution, {{it should not be}} used as the sole basis for evaluating the groundwater protection projects. There are two important limitations <b>of</b> <b>using</b> such economic efficiency criterion, namely, the ethical <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> households’ existing preferences for groundwater projection projects and distributional effects of not protecting groundwater from pollution. Taking into account the two limitations, the contribution of the study is to provide important, policy-relevant information for evaluating groundwater protection projects and water sanitation investments as well. Public awareness of groundwater pollution status, environmental degradation and protection, and the effects of environmental issues to health risk are likely to have a dramatic effect on rational behaviors or wide residents’ support for environmental improvement. Perception of the public plays an important role for the acceptance of public investment projects. This study is a pioneer in research type toward public participatory-based projects.|$|R

A nested CES production function is used to allow flexibility in the estimated elasticities of substitution. Also, with this specification, natural resources and other inputs are combined in different levels of the function, thus allowing for different levels of substitutability. Institutional and economic indicators are also incorporated in the production function estimated. Results show that the elasticities derived from functions involving land resources were generally around one or greater. Furthermore, changes in trade openness and private sector investment have a statistically significant and direct relationship with income generation.

Specifically, three discursive techniques are deployed in this campaign to achieve these ends: (1) the depiction of grief and amplification of diabetes-related danger, (2) the promotion of diabetes risk and responsibilization of individuals for their health, and (3) the commercial branding and framing of the Diabetes UK/Tesco partnership as providing tools for diabetes prevention and management.
