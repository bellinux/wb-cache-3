500|$|Ahimsā (...) in Jainism is a {{fundamental}} principle forming the cornerstone of its ethics and doctrine. The term ahimsa means nonviolence, non-injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms. Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa. The Jain concept of ahimsa {{is very different from}} the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the Jain philosophy, violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self – behaviour which inhibits the soul's own ability to attain moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths). [...] At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or <b>life</b> <b>potential.</b> All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as abhayadānam, is the supreme charity that a person can make.|$|E

[...] "It was Röschlaub's explanation which made Brown's principle {{life as a}} 'forced state' acceptable" [...] to the German mind which had a more dynamic conception of life. Röschlaub helped {{to bring out the}} dynamic interplay between the outer stimulant ('excitant') and the inner <b>life</b> <b>potential</b> (excitability) resulting in the activity known as life (biological excitation). The organism possesses an intrinsic receptive activity to be acted upon but also a proactive ability to respond. Röschlaub also refined Brown's idea that disorders resulted from an excess (hypersthenia) or deficit (hyposthenia) of stimuli by adding that this involved a disporoportion between the receptive and pro-active sides of excitability.|$|E
5000|$|Adverse {{childhood}} experiences (ACEs) {{are potentially}} traumatic events {{that can have}} negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. Adverse Childhood Experiences range from abuse to neglect to living in a household where the mother is treated violently. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 1998 study on Adverse Childhood Experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low <b>life</b> <b>potential</b> and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises. [...] Nearly 30 years of study following the initial study have confirmed this. Many states, health providers, and others now routinely screen parents and children for ACEs.|$|E

5000|$|On August 21, 1866, in {{a letter}} to Alexander Nikitenko Goncharov wrote: Now I'm going to tell you the one thing I've never told anybody before. From the moment that I started to write professionally (I was 30 and had had some {{experience}} already) I've had one artistic ideal in mind, that of creation of the character of an honest, kind and likeable man, a total idealist, who'd been struggling all his life searching for truth, encountering nothing but lies at every corner, finally lost all interest and fell into apathy, through realizing how inadequate he was and how weak was human nature as such. This was the idea that I had when I was first thinking of Raisky. Should I've had it in me to put this to realization, this figure might have grown into a serious one, but that was a mammoth task, and I was in no position to tackle it. Besides, this wave of negativism has swept through our society and our literature, starting with Belinsky and Gogol. I succumbed to it and instead of embarking upon a serious study of this particular human kind started to sketch out fleeting portraits, picking at ugly and funny features only. Such a task would have proven difficult for any talent. Shakespeare created his Hamlet, Cervantes his Don Quixote and these two giants have swallowed almost all that there's been tragic and comic in human nature. So what's been left for us, pygmies, was a set of small scale ideas and even those for us now are too hard to tackle. That is why we're reduced to making hints, nothing more. This is why Raisky comes out so foggy. [...] One character, that of Mark Volokhov, has undergone considerable evolution. Initially, according to the author, [...] "this figure was never supposed to fit into the novel's major scheme, being part of a backgrownd, in shadows," [...] a mere [...] "introductory face, serving for Vera's character fuller realization." [...] Soon, though, {{he turned out to be}} one of the novel's most prominent figures. Among rough drafts of The Precipice there was Volokhov's short 'biography' which showed him to be initially a [...] "domestic kind of a nihilist," [...] struggling in vain to realize his <b>life</b> <b>potential</b> to the full, then evolving into a kind of ideologist preaching [...] "new truth", materialism and atheism. Goncharov admitted later that Volokhov proved to be a challenging character and in the long run, a stumbling block, hindering the whole process. The author himself conceded later that [...] "the Volokhov character came like a piece of two-part cloth, one half belonging to pre-1850s, another coming from the modern times when 'new people' started to emerge." ...|$|E

Life expectancy at birth is more and more used as an indicator of development, but history tell us that life expectancy increasing leads to population ageing.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{measures}} used {{to quantify the}} burden imposed by diseases on people. The years of <b>potential</b> <b>life</b> lost (YPLL) is a simple estimate {{of the number of}} years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease. For example, if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease, and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease, then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of <b>potential</b> <b>life.</b> YPLL measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying, so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent.
