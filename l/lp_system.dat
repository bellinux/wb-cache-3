Within the (Constraint) Logic Programming ((C) LP) paradigm, Prolog has included higher-order constructs {{since the early}} days, {{and there have been}} many other proposals for combining the first-order kernel of (C) LP with different higher-order constructs. Many of these proposals are currently in use in different (C) <b>LP</b> <b>systems</b> and have been found very useful in programming practice, inheriting the well-known benefits of code reuse (templates), elegance, clarity, and modularization. A number of extensions have also been proposed for (C) LP in order to enhance the process of error detection and program validation. In addition to the use of classical strong typing, a number of other approaches have been proposed which are based on the dynamic and/or static checking of user-provided, optional assertions. Of these, the model of (Hermenegildo et al. 2005) has perhaps had the most impact in practice and different aspects of this model have been incorporated in a number of widely-used (C) <b>LP</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Ciao, SWI, and XSB.
