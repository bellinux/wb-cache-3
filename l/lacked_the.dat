Gene replacement vectors were constructed by inserting either the UMP synthase or hygromycin resistance cassette into cloned 4 -kb genomic DNA containing sequences encoding the 34 -kD protein. After transformation and growth under appropriate selection, cells <b>lacking</b> <b>the</b> protein were analyzed by PCR analyses on genomic DNA, Northern blotting, and Western blotting.
