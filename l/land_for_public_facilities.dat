Coercion from various parties such as the government that set the compensation uniterally, the land real owner who asks for unreasonable price, {{and the existence of}} consignment institution or the bailment of the compensation in the District Court when the real land owner does not agree on the amount of the compensation will bring about the right and the interest of the real land owner does get legal protection. The problems of the research were as follows: how to avoid conflict in implementing <b>land</b> acquisition <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facility,</b> how about the existence of consignment institution in <b>land</b> acquisition <b>for</b> <b>public</b> acquisition, and how about legal protection <b>for</b> the real <b>land</b> owner, based on Law No. 12 / 2012 on <b>Land</b> acquisition <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facility.</b> The result of the research showed that, in order to avoid conflict in <b>land</b> acquisition <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> was by putting forward the principle and the provision of materials in land acquisition and transparency in the procedures of land acquisition, and appropriate and righteous compensation <b>for</b> the real <b>land</b> owner. The consignment which was caused by the disagreement on compensation could not be done because it was government arbitrary action toward the people. Legal protection <b>for</b> the real <b>land</b> owner, especially the compensation, should be based on the principle of justice and feasibility by considering the guarantee for compensation both physically and non-physically so that the consignment which was caused by the disagreement was automatically not needed anymore...|$|R

The primary {{objective}} of the research {{is to examine the}} LR system as a viable alternative for financing urbanization in the case studies of LR projects in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The study develops comparative country analysis of different variations of LR schemes in four selected countries using the property rights approach (1960) and framework of transaction costs to examine the establishment and exchange of property rights to the LR system. The main questions are: is there the relevance of the Thai local characteristics that affect the initial distribution of land rights in the circumstances in Bangkok? What are the effects of transaction costs associated with the exchange process?; The study gleans some insight from the survey findings to provide, firstly, that the local characteristics of "blind land" experiencing land-development problem situations affect the demand for LR projects by means of partial <b>land</b> contribution <b>for</b> locating <b>public</b> <b>facilities.</b> Secondly, the findings strongly indicate that potential increase in land value generally motivated most of the landowners in the joint effort of cooperative LR projects. However, the study found it is difficult to proceed with project implementation because landowners were willing to give up in the lower amount (11 - 20 percent) of land contribution than requirement to make the projects self-financing. This could be explained by the dominance of small plot size and possession of a house somewhere else. Thirdly, under the circumstances of urban development in Bangkok, it appears that high transaction costs associated with the exchange process have resulted in the long delay of project implementation. Fourthly, it seems somewhat skeptical about sound management of the LR Association which is central to the LR system.; Lastly, the research concludes that the LR system attempted to apply in the case studies is very difficult to implement for Bangkok. The main limitations are a lack of legal and procedural bases of LR, lack of financial support, lack of skillful staff and sound management. In addition, it is suggested that policy makers and urban planners consider compulsory land acquisition with risk and reward borne by landowners as one finds in Australia...|$|R

Therefore, specifically, Larkana city of Pakistan is selected as the study area where the land suitability model was applied to determine suitable <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>public</b> parks.

Decision support system software called Expert choice 11. 5 was used to calculate the weights based on three alternative scenarios. Computed composite weights were inserted into the spatial analysis function of GIS and produced three scenarios of suitability maps, i. e. : (a) land availability, (b) land value and (c) population density. Hence, based on the analysis and findings made in this research, finding suitable locations using the <b>land</b> suitability model <b>for</b> future park development is highly helpful.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>facilities</b> {{planning}} normally applies {{a planning}} standard, {{such as how}} many hectares of open space are required for {{a certain number of}} people in a district. But planning standards only specify the area required and seldom specify where the <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> should be located. A location-allocation model that attempts to find the best sites for facilities is a more useful tool <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> planning. Although its application has been limited by the availability of data, even this has changed with the availability of land information systems in many cities. Accordingly, this paper discusses the integration of GIS and a location-allocation model <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> planning, using open space planning in Hong Kong as an example. It demonstrates how such a spatial decision support system can provide a set of solution spaces on which decision makers can focus their discussions and make collective choices. It can also enable decision makers to have a better view of the problem and to test different scenarios by varying the objectives, constraints, and parameters of the models. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{suggests}} that a critical reassessment {{of the theory of}} <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location is long overdue. A comprehensive theory should contain three standard analytical components: location as access; location as externality; and definition of the policy context <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> planning. Recent empirical research on mental health facility location is used to illustrate the significance of these analytical themes. Ten years ago, Michael Teitz published an important paper which advocated the development of a distinctive theory <b>for</b> urban <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location (Teitz 1968). In the decade that followed, a considerable litera-ture has appeared around this theme (Freestone 1977). That the majority of this subsequent research has remained within the bounds of the initial paradigm is a tribute to the synthesis achieved by Teitz. The contention of this essay is, however, that a fundamental realignment of the <b>public</b> <b>facility</b> location theory paradigm is necessary. There are two reasons for this asser-tion. First, in spite of the richness of the paradigm defined by Teitz, hi...|$|R
