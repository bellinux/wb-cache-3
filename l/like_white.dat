5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers <b>like</b> <b>white</b> shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Within our Solar System, {{interplanetary space}} {{is filled with}} the plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, extending from the Sun's surface out to the heliopause. Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects <b>like</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
5000|$|Black <b>Like</b> Kyra, <b>White</b> <b>Like</b> Me has {{received}} {{both positive and}} negative reviews ever since publication in 1992. Often included on lists of controversial children's literature, Black <b>Like</b> Kyra, <b>White</b> <b>Like</b> Me {{has received}} backlash for its perceived [...] "racial insensitivity and insincerity [...] ". Moreover, in 2000 Vigna was accused of [...] " [...] reinforcing negative stereotypes about blacks and positive stereotypes about whites [...] " [...] by a customer of the Toronto Public Library , however Black <b>Like</b> Kyra, <b>White</b> <b>Like</b> Me still remained on the library's shelves for public access. Nevertheless, Black <b>Like</b> Kyra, <b>White</b> <b>Like</b> Me, has received praise for being both a teaching tool about racism and a reflection of racial conflict and divide. In addition, in Pittman 's Whited Out: Unique Perspectives on Black Identity and Honors Achievement, Vigna's Black <b>like</b> Kyra, <b>White</b> <b>Like</b> Me is stated to be fundamental in producing and teaching empathy in early childhood development. Furthermore, Vigna's illustrations have been praised for their attractiveness and ability to lighten up the story's heavy mood.|$|R

25|$|Reactive {{hypoglycemia}} – Individuals with reactive hypoglycemia {{will produce}} {{an excess of}} insulin after quickly absorbing glucose into the bloodstream. This causes their blood glucose levels to fall below the amount needed for proper body and brain function. As a result, like diabetics, they must avoid intake of high-glycemic foods <b>like</b> <b>white</b> bread, and often use artificial sweeteners for sweetness without blood glucose.|$|E

25|$|Where the sea meets higher {{parts of}} the sloping landscape, {{dramatic}} cliffs emerge very suddenly. Such cliffs are white if the soil has a high content of chalk. Typically <b>like</b> <b>White</b> Cliffs of Dover, but in Scania and parts of Denmark the soil is usually more sandy, and the cliffs then becomes yellow instead. Good examples of such coastlines exists at the southern side of Ven in Øresund, and also between the towns Helsingborg and Landskrona, as well as {{parts of the}} Scanian south and south-east coast. Where the cliffs aren't steep enough, they may become overgrown with grass.|$|E
50|$|The British {{population}} in Jamaica, <b>like</b> <b>whites</b> in other Caribbean colonies, remembered the widespread massacres and violence against whites {{that accompanied the}} Haitian Revolution.

25|$|A known {{side effect}} of this policy was the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat selling over {{double the number of}} the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced {{publisher}} Acclaim to recolor the red blood to look <b>like</b> <b>white</b> sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it less violent. By contrast, Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code was required to unlock the gore). Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat II to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging.|$|E
25|$|By mid-morning on {{the second}} day {{violence}} appeared widespread and unchecked as heavy looting and arson were witnessed across Los Angeles County. Rioting began to make its way from South Central Los Angeles, going north through the neighborhoods of Central Los Angeles before reaching Hollywood. The looting and fires engulfed Hollywood Boulevard, before making its way south to the neighboring cities of Inglewood, Hawthorne, Compton and Long Beach. Korean Americans noted the law enforcement's abandonment of Koreatown, contrasting it with official defense lines for places <b>like</b> <b>white</b> neighborhoods of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. Subsequently, they organized their own armed security teams composed of store owners, who defended their livelihoods from assault by the mobs.|$|E
25|$|Detail {{in other}} colours, <b>like</b> <b>white</b> or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was {{probably}} drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The {{suggestion of a}} hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures {{was filled with a}} glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through reduction, the reddish color by a final re-oxidation. Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} age, Budapest {{developed}} its own peculiar cuisine, based on {{products of the}} nearby region, such as lamb, pork and vegetables special to the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary {{can be considered a}} melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of Saxons, Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different nougats, <b>like</b> <b>white</b> nougat called törökméz, quince (birsalma), Turkish delight, Turkish coffee or rice dishes like pilaf, meat and vegetable dishes like the eggplant, used in eggplant salads and appetizers, stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called töltött káposzta. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.|$|E

500|$|Social {{pressures}} at {{the time}} were heavily influencing these Americans (women) to have, straight hair, <b>like</b> <b>white</b> people did. This resulted in the Black is beautiful movement, wherein African Americans wore their long natural hair, that was however, untreated and unmodified. More recently, hair-extensions have become widespread. Scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have straight smooth hair. Amelia Jones points out that dolls for children, such as Barbies, add to this pressure, citing as an example a new, black Barbie with straight hair. Blacks, she believes, should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to [...] "tame" [...] their hair.|$|E

500|$|Fly agaric fruiting bodies {{emerge from}} the soil looking <b>like</b> <b>white</b> eggs. After {{emerging}} from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil; this is helpful in identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from [...] to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens. Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around [...] in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.|$|E
