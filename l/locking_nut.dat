500|$|For the M1's exterior, simple {{modifications}} {{were made}} to adapt the car aerodynamically. [...] A deep spoiler was added under {{the nose of the}} car, while an adjustable wing was added on two mounts {{at the rear of the}} engine cover. [...] The arches for the wheels were extended outward to shroud the wider [...] wheels in the front, and [...] wheels at the rear. [...] The alloy wheels, designed by Campagnolo, featured a central <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> and mimicked the straked design of the production car's wheels. [...] Inside, the car featured no finishing or luxuries from the road car, only a rollcage for driver protection. [...] The glass windows were replaced with clear plastic.|$|E

50|$|Further {{investigations}} by the HSE {{found that}} heavy and constant vibrations on the stretcher bars and their bolts caused them {{in turn to}} vibrate and oscillate until their nuts literally fell off the bolts. These have since been replaced by two-part <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> instead of the main <b>nuts</b> having half-size <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> to hold them in place.|$|R

5000|$|Another type is a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|E

50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> clamps the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|E
50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, locking nuts (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of nuts. Only one <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|E

50|$|V2 - Introduced in 2000, {{discontinued}} 2002. Has a side jack, back-routed control cavity, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose bridge, bolt-on 24 fret neck, and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> Versions were HH, HSS, HSH. These 2-octave {{models were}} made in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), and Purple Metallic (593). The V2 models also offered HH 7-string versions. The 7 string version came in two models: a Floyd Rose bridge with <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> (7FR) and a hard tail fixed bridge (7HT) with a regular nut. The 7 string models came in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587) and Purple Metallic (593). All came with black hardware.|$|E
5000|$|Ibanez Fixed Edge {{while it}} still uses the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> and locking bridge, it was mounted {{on top of}} the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a {{familiar}} feel to vibrato users, and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the MTM2, the MTM20 has a {{mahogany}} body, 5pc Maple and Walnut bolt on neck, <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> FX Edge III bridge, and the Duncan Designed active pickups. However the 'seven' inlays normally {{featured on}} higher end models was present. The MTM20 comes only in white with black binding. The MTM20 also featured a volute on the headstock.|$|E

50|$|Wheel {{steering}} is standard. The pedestal {{system is}} cable-linked with the radial driver being {{connected to the}} rudder post by a keyway and <b>lock</b> <b>nuts.</b> Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{the same}} with 24-fret necks. I put money into a company because I couldn't get guitars built the way I wanted them. I had to prove it to the manufacturers. So I put money into John Birch guitars, and he built my guitars. I had to prove it worked. All of this was done by experimenting and trial and error. I paid for that myself {{in the early days}} to show it could be done. And I paid for all these {{companies}} to get the benefits nowadays. Back then they all said it couldn't be done.

50|$|A locknut, {{also known}} as a lock nut, <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> {{prevailing}} torque nut, stiff nut or elastic stop nut, is a nut that resists loosening under vibrations and torque. Elastic stop nuts and prevailing torque nuts are of the particular type where some portion of the nut deforms elastically to provide a locking action. The first type used fiber instead of nylon and was invented in 1931.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{the company}} began the commercialization of the FRX {{surface-mounting}} locking tremolo system, designed to fit exactly on Tune-O-Matic bridge guitars, but with a <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> that is fastened to the truss rod cover. This model resembles the Washburn Wonderbar in that the springs and strings do not go through the body, thus eliminating the routing necessary to install the classic Floyd Rose tremolo in classic, fixed-bridge electric guitars.|$|E

40|$|Six Sigma is {{the concept}} of {{improving}} the quality by reducing process variations, making con-tinuous improvements, reducing defect rates and improving the processes. Initially, the concept of Six Sigma focused on defect reduction, cost reduction and value addition. Fundamentally the basic idea of Six Sigma is to improve the process-capability and making the process more relia-ble along with reducing wastes within industries. Evaluation the implication of applying Six Sigma over the small and medium-sized enterprises is the main purpose of this research work taking a particular case of automobile industries. In the present work, DMAIC methodology of Six Sigma is used to a small seat slider <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> manufacturing unit to reduce the play issue in K 2 seat slider lock in automobile units by reducing defects inherent in the process. After apply-ing Six Sigma methodology, it was found that manufacturing units could earn profits in terms of reducing the wastage as well as improving the quality standard of the product by controlling the play issue in seat slider <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> mechanism. Result shows that with the application of Six Sig-ma, process, sigma level brought up to 5. 53 σ from 1. 59 σ by varying the seat slider <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> di-mensions/size. ...|$|R

50|$|Somewhat counterintuitively, {{the term}} {{threadless}} derives not from whether the stem itself is threaded, but from whether a headset <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> threads onto the fork steer tube. Quill stems require a threaded headset of specific length for each bicycle model. Threadless stems require an unthreaded steerer tube, which may vary in length for each bicycle model.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} provide a cable stop for front {{cantilever}} brakes or centerpull brakes, a hanger may {{be incorporated into the}} headset, either as part of the washer between the top race and the <b>lock</b> <b>nut</b> in the case of threaded headsets, or as part of a spacer between the top race and the stem in the case of threadless headsets.|$|R
