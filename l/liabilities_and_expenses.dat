The agreement quickly fell into dispute with the owner claiming that the full loan amount was never received and the lender charging that the vessel's debts and deficiencies had been misrepresented {{and that it had}} been fraudulently induced into making the loan. The parties became involved a lawsuit in 2013 with the case eventually being ruled in favor of the lender after alleging that the borrower's legal team had fabricated communications, destroyed evidence, and attempted to intimidate witnesses and Sequoia would be sold to them for $7.8M USD less <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses.</b> An independent counsel was appointed to oversee the sale of Sequoia but the lender claimed that there were additional liabilities which exceeded the vessel's purchase price and her owner failed to keep her in good working order. On July 30, 2015 the presiding judge ordered the lender to decide within 60 days whether or not it will buy Sequoia. The lender argued that it had until 2017 to decide on its purchase option since the original term of the 2012 loan was for five years.|$|E

BK&L developed predictions of the pro forma effect on assets, <b>liabilities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses</b> due to SFAS 143 adoption by nuclear power utilities. This study examines the actual financial statement effect on BK&L's sample firms due to the adoption of SFAS 143. Results indicate that concern voiced over the standard's requirement to capitalize asset retirement obligations and the related asset, and to record additional expenses by nuclear power companies may have been unfounded.

40|$|AbstractThe {{complexity}} of financial statement fraud has received considerable attention {{over the past}} few years and will continue to cause concern. Financial statement fraud can surface in many different forms such as overstating assets, sales and profit, understating <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses.</b> Although once deceptive accounting practices are initiated, various systems of manipulation will be utilized to maintain the appearance of sustainability. Financial statements are used by shareholders to measure the performance of the firm versus expectations. However, it is sometimes manipulated to meet own greed. Lots of studies have been done in detecting and predicting the occurrence of financial statement fraud. This study explores the significant impact of corporate culture in the occurrence of financial statement fraud. Culture has been widely accepted as a pattern of behavior which influences the character of society.

This paper provides a holistic view of the concept of culture and its effect on organization and behavior. The second purpose is to discuss the effect of the corporate culture within the perspective of financial statement fraud.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical {{question of whether}} systematic equity risk of U. S. firms as measured by beta from the Capital Asset Pricing Model reflects the risk of their pension plans. There {{are a number of}} reasons to suspect that it might not. Chief among them is the opaque set of accounting rules used to report pension assets, <b>liabilities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses.</b> Pension plan assets and liabilities are off-balance sheet, and are often viewed as segregated {{from the rest of the}} firm, with its own trustees. Pension accounting rules are complicated. Furthermore, the role of Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation further clouds the real relation between pension plan risk and firm equity risk. The empirical findings in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that equity risk does reflect the risk of the firm’s pension plan despite arcane accounting rules for pensions. This finding is consistent with informational efficiency of the capital markets. It also has implications for corporate finance practice in the determination of the cost of capital for capital budgeting. Standard procedure uses de-leveraged equity return betas to infer the cost of capital for operating assets. They do not adjust the estimated beta for the risk of non-operating assets such as pensio...|$|E
40|$|Company's {{stakeholders}} make {{business decisions}} based on information presented by management. The quality of decisions, among other things, depends on the quality and reliability of information in the financial reports. Business practice demonstrates that managers tend to present a false picture of the financial position and profitability of the company, often {{in cooperation with the}} owners of the capital. Procedures that management and investors take, {{in order to create a}} false impression about the performances of the enterprise, the contemporary literature defines as creative financial reporting. Presentation of better financial performance than realistic one provides misleading signals about the company, while the users of information are misinformed. The goal of this paper is the analysis of opportunities to implement creative cash flow reporting and the factors that encourage the company’s management and the owners of the capital to wrong and misleading interpretation of performance items. After the presentation of the main motive of creative financial reporting, we shall focus on examples of erroneous classification of cash flows. Earnings management and the shaping of cash flows may be realised within and beyond the boundaries of accounting regulations on several ways, but a special review in the paper is dedicate to creative reporting procedures of cash inflow and outflow related to receivables, investments, <b>liabilities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses.</b> Consequences of creative reporting on cash flow and other performances could be serious both for stakeholders and for survival of the company, which is discussed in the last part of the paper...|$|E
