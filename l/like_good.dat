25|$|Performances at {{the public}} theatres were {{generally}} allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays <b>like</b> <b>Good</b> Friday. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they could. They were supposed to cease playing entirely during Lent but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the Lord Strange's Men played daily at the Rose Theatre right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels.|$|E

He saw action at the Battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 {{as one of the}} junior flag officers. Reports of his actions during the battle were confused and contradictory, some accounts suggesting that he had taken a squadron of six ships and pursued nine Dutch vessels, others stating that he had abandoned the fight {{after the death of his}} brother, Charles. Poet Andrew Marvell added a critical verse suggesting the latter view was correct in his 1666 poem 'The Second Advice to a Painter': Berkeley had heard it soon, and thought not goodTo venture more of royal Harding's blood …With his whole squadron straight away he bore,And, <b>like</b> <b>good</b> boy, promised to fight no more.|$|E

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are <b>like</b> <b>good</b> investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{urbanization}} is fairly contributed by population growth, immigration, migration, and infrastructure initiatives <b>like</b> <b>good</b> road, water, power, and gardens, {{resulting in the}} growth of villages into towns, town into cities and cities into metros. However, in such a phenomenon for ecological feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the growth dynamics, if not people will continue moving from our villages in search of greener pasture living only the aged men and women to farm, this is noticeable in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They major in the production of yam, Cocoyam and cassava through consistent agriculture. These agricultural activities have in recent time suffered a setback due to massive out-migration of their youths to the urban centres, thereby resulting in food scarcity and over population in urban environment.|$|E

To score three goals is not easy. I can say that we are very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory."

500|$|Green Day, which {{formed in}} 1986 and spent early years touring punk rock clubs, {{emerged in the}} early 1990s {{as one of the}} most popular rock acts. Their third album and major-label debut Dookie (1994) sold upwards of 20 million copies. Subsequent {{releases}} were also hits, including the multi-platinum successes Insomniac (1995) and Nimrod (1997); these certifications, however, were fractions of the diamond certification Dookie would attain. Their subsequent album Warning, released in 2000, was considered a significant commercial disappointment, despite largely positive reviews. In early 2002, the band embarked on the Pop Disaster Tour, co-headlining with Blink-182. The tour created momentum for the trio, who began to be viewed as [...] "elder statesmen" [...] of the pop punk scene at the time, which consisted of bands <b>like</b> <b>Good</b> Charlotte, Sum 41, and New Found Glory.|$|E

500|$|The Lithuanian {{scholar of}} {{literature}} [...] writes that Mickiewicz's family was descended {{from an old}} Lithuanian noble family (Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania's Christianization. The Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz's time was heavily Polonized and spoke Polish. Mickiewicz had been {{brought up in the}} culture of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities, due to trends such as Lithuanian separatism, was undesirable, if not outright unthinkable. According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a [...] "Lithuanian", in his time the idea of a separate [...] "Lithuanian identity", apart from a [...] "Polish" [...] one, did not exist. [...] This multicultural aspect is evident in his works; his most famous poetic work, Pan Tadeusz, begins with the Polish-language invocation, [...] "O Lithuania, my country, thou art <b>like</b> <b>good</b> health..." [...] ("Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie...". It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term [...] "Lithuanian" [...] to the Slavic inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (see Litvin).|$|E
500|$|That same year, Divine {{decided to}} get back in contact with his estranged parents. His mother had learned of his {{cinematic}} and disco career after reading an article about the films of John Waters in Life magazine, and had gone to see Female Trouble at the cinema, but had not felt emotionally able {{to get back in}} contact with her son until 1981. She got a friend to hand Divine a note at one of his concerts, leading Divine to telephone her, and the family was subsequently reunited. The relationship was mended, and Divine bought them lavish gifts and informed them of how wealthy he was. In fact, according to his manager Bernard Jay, he was already heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending. In 1982, he then joined forces with young American composer Bobby Orlando, who wrote a number of Hi-NRG singles for Divine, including [...] "Native Love (Step By Step)," [...] "Shoot Your Shot", and [...] "Love Reaction". To help publicize these singles, which proved to be successful in many discos across the world, Divine went on television shows <b>like</b> <b>Good</b> Morning America, as well as on a series of tours in which he combined his musical performances with comedic stunts and routines that often played up to his characters' stereotype of being [...] "trashy" [...] and outrageous. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, Divine took his musical performances on tour across the world, attaining a particularly large following in Europe.|$|E

Ninsar then gave birth to Ninkurra (Lady Fruitfulness or Lady Pasture), and leaves Enki alone again.

The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible.
