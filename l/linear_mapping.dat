As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique <b>linear</b> <b>mapping</b> from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E

40|$|Verification {{of large}} {{programs}} is impossible without proof techniques that allow local reasoning and information hiding. In this paper, we resurrect, extend and modernize an old {{approach to this}} problem first considered {{in the context of}} the programming language Euclid, developed in the 70 s. The central idea is that rather than modeling the heap as a single total function from addresses (integers) to integers, we model the heap as a collection of partial functions with disjoint domains. We call each such partial function a <b>linear</b> <b>map.</b> Programmers may select objects from <b>linear</b> <b>maps,</b> update <b>linear</b> <b>maps</b> or transfer addresses and their contents from one <b>linear</b> <b>map</b> to another. Programmers may also declare new <b>linear</b> <b>map</b> variables and pass <b>linear</b> <b>maps</b> as arguments to procedures. The program logic prevents any of these operations from duplicating locations and thereby breaking the key heap representation invariant: the domains of all <b>linear</b> <b>maps</b> remain disjoint. <b>Linear</b> <b>maps</b> facilitate modular reasoning because programs that use them are also able to use simple, classical frame rules to preserve information about heap state across procedure calls. We illustrate our approach through examples, prove that our verification rules are sound, and show that operations on <b>linear</b> <b>maps</b> may be erased and replaced by equivalent operations on a single, global heap. 1...|$|R
