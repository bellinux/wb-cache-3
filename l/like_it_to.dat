500|$|The Four Freedoms {{are perhaps}} Rockwell's most famous work. Some {{have said that}} Rockwell's Four Freedoms lack artistic maturity. [...] Others have pointed to the {{universality}} of the Freedom of Religion as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths. [...] Others complained that he idealized American life because by depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments, Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of {{the bad and the}} ugly parts of American life. Rockwell's response to this criticism was, [...] "I paint life as I would <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed. Nonetheless, he was satisfied with the public acceptance of the series and that the series was able to serve such a patriotic purpose.
