5|$|The {{touchdown}} (TD), worth six points, is {{the most}} valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> is advanced into, caught in, or recovered {{in the end zone}} of the opposing team. The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Passing: passing {{rules in}} arena {{football}} {{are the same}} as outdoor NCAA football in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> and is in play until it touches the playing surface.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a {{fly ball}} to deep right field. Originally ruled a <b>live</b> <b>ball,</b> instant replay showed Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was {{interfered}} with by multiple fans during his opportunity {{to catch a}} ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected {{to play the game}} under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Atlanta trailed 17–6. Facing 3rd & 8 at their own 19-yard line, an unusual play occurred. Matt Ryan {{completed}} a 20-yard pass to Roddy White. White fumbled, and it was recovered by Sabby Piscitelli of the Buccaneers. Piscitelli then ran 3 yards and attempted a lateral to Cato June. The lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, and fell incomplete to the ground. Thought to be a <b>live</b> <b>ball,</b> it was recovered once more by Atlanta, meanwhile a flag for a personal foul by Tampa Bay was also on the field. After several minutes of confusion and discussion by the officials, they awarded the ball to Atlanta at the Tampa Bay 48-yard line. Atlanta continued the drive and managed a field goal, trimming the lead to 17–9.|$|E
25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after going for it on fourth down at midfield and getting help from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with only a few seconds left in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the <b>live</b> <b>ball.</b> Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
500|$|A major {{variant of}} {{football}} is arena football, {{played by the}} Arena Football League (AFL). Arena football has eight-player teams and uses an indoor field [...] in length, excluding end zones, and [...] wide. Punting is illegal, and kickoffs are attempted from the goal line. Large overhead nets deflect forward passes and kicks that hit them, and deflected kicks are <b>live</b> <b>balls</b> that may be recovered by either team.|$|R

500|$|As a result, the 1906 {{season was}} played {{under a new}} set of rules. The rules {{governing}} intercollegiate football were changed to promote a more open and less dangerous style of play. An intercollegiate conference, which would become the forerunner of the NCAA, approved radical changes including [...] the legalization of the forward pass, allowing the punting team to recover an on-side kick as a <b>live</b> <b>ball,</b> abolishing the dangerous flying wedge, creating a neutral zone between offense and defense, and doubling the first-down distance to 10 yards, to be gained in three downs.|$|E

[...] First, the rules {{governing}} intercollegiate were changed to promote a more [...] "open" [...] and less dangerous style of play. [...] The changes included the legalization of the forward pass and allowing the punting team to recover an [...] "on-side" [...] kick as a <b>live</b> <b>ball.</b> [...] Second, the Big Nine Conference enacted new rules, including a rule limiting teams to five games (a drastic reduction from the 13 games played by Michigan in 1905) and prohibitions on the [...] "training table" [...] and pre-season training {{before the start of}} the academic year.|$|E
2500|$|The Buccaneers took {{advantage}} of Minnesota Vikings mistakes to get an upset and their first win of the season. The Buccaneers scored on a 5-yard pass from Doug Williams to Morris Owens, after a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> that had hit a Viking on a punt return was recovered by Billy Cesare on the Vikings’ 5-yard line. Vikings coach Bud Grant later claimed that returner Kevin Miller never touched the ball, and blamed the loss on the officials. Fran Tarkenton completed 23 of 31 passes for 180 yards, but threw two interceptions {{and was replaced by}} Tommy Kramer in the final two minutes. Kramer promptly threw an interception to Cecil Johnson. Tarkenton also hit Ahmad Rashād for a 4-yard touchdown to finish a 63-yard first-quarter drive. Later, Jeris White's interception of a Tarkenton pass would lead to a 2-yard Ricky Bell touchdown run. The Buccaneers’ defense, still steamed over Tarkenton's comments two years earlier that the Buccaneers would be his preferred AFC opponent in the Super Bowl, held the Vikings to 73 yards rushing and sacked Tarkenton four times. They also came through big by holding the Vikings to a field goal, following a bizarre play in which the Vikings recovered a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> on a failed field goal attempt and returned it for 80 yards. Grant called the game a defensive contest, saying that there were no good offensive plays in the entire match. John McKay said that [...] "when we shut off their running game, we knew we were in the game and could get 'em", and that the Buccaneers should have a 3–0 record. The game left the two teams tied with 1–2 records.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{opened its}} 1971 {{season with a}} 21–6 victory over Northwestern in front of 42,472 spectators at Dyche Stadium in Evanston, Illinois. Sophomore Kevin Casey started at quarterback and {{completed}} only four of 11 passes for 34 yards and had one pass intercepted. Michigan's first touchdown was scored {{in the second quarter}} by split end Bo Rather on [...] "an 18-yard razzle-dazzle end around TD run," [...] with Jim Brandstatter making a key block. Rather scored again in the third quarter after a 51-yard field goal attempt by Dana Coin was knocked down by a Northwestern player as it fell short; Rather fell on the ball in the end zone, and the officials ruled it a <b>live</b> <b>ball</b> and fumble recovery. Tailback Billy Taylor scored Michigan's third touchdown on a five-yard touchdown run later in the third quarter. Taylor totaled 105 rushing yards on 28 carries in the game. Kicker Dana Coin converted all three point after touchdown attempts. On defense, Frank Gusich had two interceptions. [...] Northwestern scored its touchdown in the fourth quarter on a short pass. After the game, coach Schembechler told the press, [...] "It was no masterpiece, but it was effective." ...|$|E

[...] Clarence Schenk scored Michigan's fourth touchdown on a [...] "cross buck" [...] from the five-yard line. [...] The final touchdown was scored by Arthur [...] "Waukegan" [...] Wright, a substitute right tackle who was described as [...] "the 'pompadour' haired medic from Illinois," [...] on a 35-yard run following an on-side kick. [...] A rule change enacted in 1906 allowed the punting team to recover a punt as a <b>live</b> <b>ball.</b> [...] The Detroit Free Press described Wright's touchdown as follows:"Garrels made an on-side punt to the Case thirty-five yard line. [...] Wright brought the ball to his breast after the bound as if it was his long-lost child, and was saving it from the kidnappers. [...] Three Case men tried to stop him as he was making the run for his fireside home, but he seemed to have a through ticket without a [...] punch, and scored the first touchdown of the year on the new rules." ...|$|E
