5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the <b>Luxembourgish</b> people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|Pierlot {{was one of}} {{the chief}} {{supporters}} of the Benelux Customs Union negotiated with both the Dutch and <b>Luxembourgish</b> governments in exile and signed in September 1944. Unlike Spaak, who was a staunch supporter of greater cooperation between states in Western Europe, Pierlot supported a transatlantic alliance with the United States to guarantee Belgian independence {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Belgian, the Netherlands and <b>Luxembourgish</b> {{governments in}} exile began formulating an {{agreement}} over {{the creation of}} a Benelux Customs Union. The agreement was signed in the London Customs Convention on 5 September 1944, just days before the Belgian government returned to Brussels after the liberation. The Benelux Customs Union was a major extension of a pre-war union between Belgium and Luxembourg, and would later form the basis of the Benelux Economic Union after 1958.|$|E
25|$|Between 2000 and 2002, <b>Luxembourgish</b> {{linguist}} Jérôme Lulling {{compiled a}} lexical database of 125,000 word forms {{as the basis}} for the very first <b>Luxembourgish</b> spellchecker (Projet C.ORT.IN.A).|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{helping other}} {{researchers}} in their work, the CNL also does its own literary research. It regularly publishes exhibition catalogues, essays on <b>Luxembourgish</b> literature and scholarly re-editions of important works by <b>Luxembourgish</b> authors. A {{list of the}} CNL's publications shows that the institute's research tries to reflect the ample use {{of each of the}} country's three national languages, namely <b>Luxembourgish,</b> French and German.|$|E
25|$|The LaF (Lëtzebuergesch als Friemsprooch – <b>Luxembourgish</b> as a Foreign Language) {{is a set}} of four {{language}} proficiency certifications for <b>Luxembourgish</b> and follows the ALTE framework of language examination standards. The tests are administered by the Institut National des Langues Luxembourg.|$|E
25|$|The CNL {{regularly}} organises exhibitions {{which often}} display manuscripts or other precious {{items from the}} archives' funds to the general public. The exhibitions deal with <b>Luxembourgish</b> literary life in the broadest sense, and often highlight cultural exchanges between <b>Luxembourgish</b> and German or French authors.|$|E
25|$|One {{must be a}} <b>Luxembourgish</b> citizen.|$|E
25|$|Spoken <b>Luxembourgish</b> is {{relatively}} {{hard to understand}} for speakers of German who are generally not familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects (or at least other West Central German dialects). However, they can usually read the language to some degree. For those Germans familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects, it {{is relatively}} easy to understand and speak <b>Luxembourgish</b> as far as the everyday vocabulary is concerned. However, the large number of French loanwords in <b>Luxembourgish</b> may hamper communication about certain topics, or with certain speakers (who use many French loanwords).|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the government of Luxembourg observed its neutrality and issued an official proclamation to that effect on September 6, 1939. On May 10, 1940, an invasion by German armed forces swept away the <b>Luxembourgish</b> government and monarchy into exile. The German troops made up of the 1st, 2nd, and 10th Panzer Divisions invaded at 04:35. They did not encounter any significant resistance save for some bridges destroyed and some land mines since the majority of the <b>Luxembourgish</b> Volunteer Corps stayed in their barracks. <b>Luxembourgish</b> police resisted the German troops, but to little avail and the capital city was occupied before noon. Total <b>Luxembourgish</b> casualties amounted to 75 police and soldiers captured, six police wounded, and one soldier wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} the main base for the two <b>Luxembourgish</b> airlines, Luxair and Cargolux.|$|E
25|$|The {{consonant}} {{inventory of}} <b>Luxembourgish</b> is {{quite similar to}} that of Standard German.|$|E
25|$|Project Gutenberg Luxembourg publishes mostly, but not exclusively, {{books that}} are written in <b>Luxembourgish.</b>|$|E
25|$|From May 1941 many <b>Luxembourgish</b> {{youth were}} ordered to {{participate}} in the Reichsarbeitsdienst.|$|E
25|$|<b>Luxembourgish</b> is the {{national}} language of Luxembourg and one of three administrative languages, alongside French and German.|$|E
25|$|The {{resemblance}} of the <b>Luxembourgish</b> flag {{with the}} Dutch flag {{has given rise}} to a national debate to change it.|$|E
25|$|Edward Jean Steichen (March 27, 1879 – March 25, 1973) was a <b>Luxembourgish</b> American photographer, painter, and {{art gallery}} and museum curator.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{intelligibility}} between <b>Luxembourgish</b> and French {{or any of}} the Romance dialects {{spoken in}} the adjacent parts of Belgium and France.|$|E
25|$|<b>Luxembourgish</b> {{belongs to}} the West Central German group of High German {{languages}} and is the primary example of a Moselle Franconian language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Luxembourgish</b> {{is spoken}} {{mainly in the}} Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, but it also extends into small parts of Belgium, France, and Germany.|$|E
25|$|René Engelmann (1880–1915), a {{linguist}} and novelist, who {{established the}} basic grammar of the <b>Luxembourgish</b> dialect, later {{to become a}} national language.|$|E
25|$|While {{it could}} be {{considered}} a standardized variety (i.e., a dialect with a written form) of German, its official use in the state of Luxembourg and the existence of a separate regulatory body has removed <b>Luxembourgish,</b> at least in part, from the domain of the Dachsprache Standard German. Despite the lack of a sharp boundary between <b>Luxembourgish</b> and the neighboring German dialects, this has led several linguists (from Luxembourg as well as Germany) to regard it as a separate, yet closely related language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Luxembourgish</b> is also {{spoken in}} the Arelerland region of Belgium (part of the Province of Luxembourg) and in small parts of Lorraine in France.|$|E
