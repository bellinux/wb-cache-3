5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from <b>laughing.</b> <b>In</b> the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised I Not Stupid Too for its {{touching}} {{portrayal of}} the problems faced by Singaporean teenagers. According to a review in the South China Morning Post, the movie [...] "presents a candid portrait of Singaporean society at odds with its stereotypically squeaky clean image". Nie Peng of Shenzhen Daily felt the film [...] "captured the emotional depth and effectively conveyed the underlying theme of generation gaps", while movieXclusive.com reviewer Jolene Tan called it [...] "a good local movie that will have [...] <b>laughing</b> <b>in</b> stitches and crying at certain points". However, I Not Stupid Too was also panned for being overly preachy: a reviewer for The Hindu said that the movie [...] "feels like a public service program written by Singapore's social welfare department". Geoffrey Eu, a reviewer for The Business Times, commented that it [...] "takes the line that the viewer needs to be clubbed into submission rather than persuaded via a more subtle line of reasoning".|$|E

500|$|By 1837, Marx {{was writing}} both fiction and non-fiction, having {{completed}} a short novel, Scorpion and Felix, a drama, Oulanem, {{as well as}} a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime. Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, art history and the translation of Latin classics. He began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel's Philosophy of Religion in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature, which he completed in 1841. It was described as [...] "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy". The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841. As Marx and Bauer were both atheists, in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled Archiv des Atheismus (Atheistic Archives), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, <b>laughing</b> <b>in</b> church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} highly {{acclaimed}} by critics and audiences alike. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised the film, calling it, [...] "one {{of the most}} deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Two things, however, make Raiders of the Lost Ark {{more than just a}} technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] We find ourselves <b>laughing</b> <b>in</b> surprise, in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions." [...] He later added it to his list of [...] "Great Movies". Rolling Stone said the film was [...] "the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week." [...] Bruce Williamson of Playboy claimed: [...] "There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of Raiders than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted." [...] Stephen Klain of Variety also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.|$|E
