5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable <b>liferaft.</b> Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E

25|$|In April 1967, Perth {{was ordered}} to Macquarie Island to rescue a seriously ill researcher. The ship arrived without incident, but {{conditions}} at the island were so adverse to boat handling that instead, the ship's diver swam ashore and back towing a <b>liferaft.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Liferafts</b> are {{commonly}} used worldwide as a primary or a secondary means of evacuation from merchant ships, passenger vessels, fishing boats, and offshore petroleum installations. In many cases, <b>liferafts</b> are required by regulations or laws whose explicit aims are {{to provide for the}} safety of life at sea. Despite being almost universally prescribed and carried by ships and offshore platforms, the actual performance that can be expected of <b>liferafts</b> and the people who have to use them in practice is largely unknown. Current Canadian regulations only require the successful completion of tests in calm water in order for manufacturers to obtain type approvals for their <b>liferafts</b> [1]. The performance of <b>liferafts</b> in ocean conditions is thus unknown. This absence of qualitative and quantitative knowledge, especially in different weather conditions, weakens rational decision-making processes and a host of associated search and rescue operations and planning.

50|$|Capacity for 365 persons was {{provided}} in nine 24 ft metallic lifeboats on hinged davits and four Carley <b>liferafts.</b> Carley <b>liferafts</b> had been condemned on coastwise ships on 31 December 1913 but shipowners {{had been granted}} a 90-day extension.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{lifeboats}} have a motor; <b>liferafts</b> {{usually do}} not. Large lifeboats use a davit or launching system (there might be multiple lifeboats on one), {{that requires a}} human to launch. Lifeboat launching takes longer and has higher risk of failure due to human factors. However lifeboats do not suffer from inflation system failures as inflatable <b>liferafts</b> do.|$|R
25|$|As Cyclops {{lifeboats}} {{were launched}} and got clear, Kersley {{and some of}} his officers remained aboard to ensure that everyone who was still alive had left. 29 minutes after the first attack U-123 fired a second torpedo from one of her stern tubes, which hit Cyclops port side. The ship immediately started to break up and sank within five minutes. Some of those remaining aboard managed to reach a <b>liferaft</b> that the Chief Officer had released only minutes before.|$|E
25|$|Three other {{survivors}} {{managed to}} board a small <b>liferaft.</b> One was the duty radio officer who had sent the distress message. The others were a badly wounded DEMS gunner, EG Elliot RN, and a passenger called Frank Brothers. After they had drifted for four days they sighted a submarine and used the reflective surface of a tobacco tin as a heliograph to attract her attention. The submarine, {{which may have been}} U-124, came and gave them fresh water. The next day the weather worsened, and in the afternoon the radio officer died.|$|E
25|$|Kormoran was {{abandoned}} and scuttled at midnight; she sank slowly until the mine hold exploded {{half an hour}} later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two battle-damaged steel life rafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72, one boat with 31 aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26. During the evacuation, a rubber <b>liferaft</b> carrying 60, mostly wounded, sank without warning; the three survivors were placed in other boats. Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese sailor.|$|E

25|$|They {{arrived back}} in Singapore, on 11 February, {{three days after}} the island had been invaded. As the Allied air force units on Singapore had been {{destroyed}} or evacuated by this stage, Gorton was put on the Derrymore, an ammunition ship bound for Batavia (Jakarta). On 13 February, as it neared its destination, the ship was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-55 Kaidai class submarine and the Derrymore was abandoned. Gorton then spent almost a day on a crowded <b>liferaft,</b> in shark-infested waters, with little drinking water, until the raft was spotted by HMAS Ballarat, which picked up the passengers and took them to Batavia.|$|E
25|$|The weather worsened; several {{attempts}} {{to attach a}} tow-line to U-570 were unsuccessful. Believing the Germans were being obstructive, Burwell's captain, S.R.J. Woods ordered a machine gunner to fire warning shots, shots that accidentally hit and slightly wounded five of the German crew. With much difficulty, an officer and three sailors from Kingston Agate reached the submarine using a Carley float (a <b>liferaft).</b> After a quick search failed to find the U-boat's Enigma machine, they attached a tow line and carried out {{the transfer of the}} five wounded men and the submarine's officers to Kingston Agate. The remaining crew were taken on board HMCS Niagara, which by this time had come alongside U-570.|$|E
25|$|Kormoran was stationary, and at 18:25, Detmers {{ordered the}} ship to be abandoned, as damage to the raider's engine room had knocked out the {{fire-fighting}} systems, {{and there was no}} way to control or contain the oil fire before it reached the magazines or the mine hold. All boats and liferafts were launched by 21:00, and all but one filled: a skeleton crew manned the weapons while the officers prepared to scuttle the ship. Kormoran was abandoned at midnight; the ship sank slowly until the mine hold exploded 30 minutes later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two damaged steel liferafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72 people, one boat with 31 men aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26 sailors. During the evacuation, a rubber <b>liferaft</b> carrying 60 people, mostly wounded, sank without warning; drowning all but three aboard.

500|$|Intuition {{attempted}} to fund their next game, <b>Liferaft,</b> via crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The game {{is set in}} a single day within an [...] "abandoned testing facility ... in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi" [...] world. The player-character is a young woman named Goss who had been surviving off of lichen until a giant squid crashes into the room and allows her escape. <b>Liferaft</b> was built for release in three episodes: her escape, [...] "revelation", and [...] "resolution". The core gameplay revolves around a [...] "Bionic Commando-style grappling hook". Intuition released a two-level Flash demo where the game had 16-bit era graphics and music composed by Danny Baranowsky of Canabalt and Fathom. They expected development to take six months between November 2009 and February 2010. They canceled the Kickstarter and put the project on hiatus in October 2009 for two small Flash games and an intern's Unity project.|$|E
500|$|Offshore, several ships came {{in contact}} with Bertha, many {{reported}} sustained winds of 35-58mph (56–93km/h) and a Canadian ship reported a barometric pressure of [...] The only reported shipwreck caused by Bertha was when the Corazon, a Greek freighter capsized and sank during the storm. The ship, which was off the coast of Cape Cod {{at the time of its}} sinking, was experiencing strong winds up to 78mph (126km/h) and 30feet (9.1m) waves. The rough seas caused the ship's keel to break, causing the crewmen to send a distress signal and evacuate the sinking vessel. During the evacuation, one crewman drowned when trying to board a lifeboat, his body was later found by a Soviet merchant ship. Another merchant ship, the Vyapel, spotted twelve of the 27sailors in their <b>liferaft</b> and the crew of the Vyapel tried to rescue the sailors but to no avail as the rough seas caused the <b>liferaft</b> to drift near the ships propeller and rudder area. The turbulence caused by the ships propeller knocked seven sailors into the water, five of them drowned and a search for their bodies continued until the following day. The remaining 21sailors were later rescued by crews of other freighters and merchant ships. An investigation by the United States Coast Guard revealed that the Corazon's lifeboats were in too poor of a condition to use in case of an emergency.|$|E
500|$|Mikengreg {{announced}} Liferaft: Zero and Solipskier in November 2010.

Wohlwend and Boxleiter made the shorter version to limit the scope creep of the overall project. IndieGames.com named the Flash game their third best browser platformer of the year. Their other game, 4fourths, was put on hiatus for lack of resources. They were interested in making games outside the Flash market.|$|E

500|$|After June 1917, U-70 only sank {{another three}} ships {{throughout}} the rest of the war, one of which was the British Flower-class sloop [...] on 5 May 1918. Rhododendron had been constructed in 1917 as a purpose built Q-ship, a warship disguised as a merchant ship to lure German submarines within range of their concealed gun batteries. The sloop was patrolling off Mull Head in the Orkney Islands when struck by a single torpedo from U-70. The captain, Lieutenant Commander Charles Arthur Peal, became disoriented in the aftermath of the explosion, and instead of ordering away a [...] "panic party" [...] to draw the submarine within range, ordered the complete evacuation of the ship, which was carried out in great haste and confusion. U-70 approached the burning ship and observed the chaotic evacuation, seizing a petty officer from a <b>liferaft</b> who revealed the ship's true identity. U-70 shelled the wreck and escaped without coming under fire. Rhododendron capsized and sank the following morning, with the loss of 15 men, four killed in the explosion and 11 drowned during the evacuation. Peal and the rest of the crew were heavily criticized for their conduct under fire by an Admiralty board.|$|E
500|$|In their {{development}} process, Boxleiter and Wohlwend both proposed {{and worked on}} each other's ideas, and would drop the ideas they found unexciting. The two also built games from keywords and brainstorming, and would flesh out the game mechanics through [...] "heated" [...] argument. Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as [...] "left-brain right-brain", and agreed that [...] "editing"—the process of iterating through revisions—was central to their joint work. As they worked, they always retained their prototypes. They both appreciated the [...] "creative freedom" [...] of being self-employed, though they struggled with the business aspects, relative workplace [...] "isolation", low salaries, and lack of job stability. Both were motivated {{to do their own}} work instead of contracted tasks. They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable. At Intuition, they worked on games such as Dinowaurs, Gray, Fig. 8, and <b>Liferaft</b> and participated in at least six game jams. As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together.|$|E
500|$|Their later games {{would only}} take a few months each, in comparison. They {{abandoned}} the use of design documents after Dinowaurs, and instead chose to refine and experiment in process. Intuition released Effing Hail and Gray around April 2009. Players in action game Effing Hail control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The game was published through Kongregate. In Gray, players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd. The game was featured at IndieCade in 2009. In the case of Fig. 8., Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project. In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor. The concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. In their next game, <b>Liferaft,</b> the player-character is a young woman set to escape [...] "a post-apocalyptic sci-fi ... test chamber", with core gameplay that revolves around a [...] "Bionic Commando-style grappling hook". Wohlwend used a 16-bit era graphics style. They sought crowdfunding from Kickstarter, but later canceled and put the project on hiatus in October 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{airborne}} lifeboat {{was developed}} for the RAF to provide a means of rescue for downed aircrew. A search and rescue aircraft would drop the lifeboat by parachute to the crew, who could then attempt {{to make their own}} way back to a friendly shore. Although aircraft carried their own inflatable <b>liferafts,</b> these merely protected the crew from drowning and were not navigable vessels. Crew taking to their <b>liferafts</b> near a hostile shore would often be captured, if they were not first rescued by air-sea rescue launches.|$|R
5000|$|The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) {{makes it}} a {{requirement}} for merchant ships to have <b>liferafts</b> {{on each side of}} the ship, sufficient for all the people on board (the stated capacity of the lifeboat, irrespective of the fact that there may actually be fewer people on board). However, if the lifeboats are [...] "easily transferable" [...] (viz. have an open deck between port and starboard lifeboat decks), the number of <b>liferafts</b> may be reduced to a total sufficient for the ship's capacity.|$|R

2500|$|The {{casualties}} [...] "had {{an immense}} {{impact on the}} world concept of ferry safety" [...] and led to changes in safety regulations {{as well as in}} <b>liferaft</b> design, much as the Titanic disaster did in 1912.|$|E
2500|$|An object can be {{classified}} as either an active object like a ship navigating through a waterway or a passive object like a <b>liferaft,</b> drifting debris, or {{a person in the}} water (PIW) (Figure 3). [...] A passive object will experience the greatest leeway drift and it is this drift that is of utmost importance to those involved in search and rescue (SAR) upon inland waterways and open oceans.|$|E
2500|$|Estonias {{distress}} beacons or EPIRBs required manual activation, {{which did}} not happen. Had they been activated automatically, {{it would have been}} immediately obvious that the ship had sunk and the location would have been clear. All EPIRBs were subsequently required to deploy automatically and the accident was [...] "instrumental in the move to legislate Voyage Data Recorders". New International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) <b>liferaft</b> regulations for rescue from listing ships in rough water were introduced, though launching such craft, even in training exercises, remains dangerous for the crew.|$|E
50|$|The {{cruise ship}} carried 14 {{lifeboats}} and 90 <b>liferafts.</b> The torpedo destroyed one starboard and disabled the davits and falls of another. Two boats were damaged during their launch and thus useless. The crew successfully launched the remaining 10 boats {{and more than}} half the <b>liferafts.</b> Some boats were overloaded by prisoners descending the falls and side ladders, but many of the Italians were too afraid to leave the ship. At least four of the remaining lifeboats were launched with {{a very small number of}} survivors. One other lifeboat was swamped and sank shortly after being launched.|$|R
