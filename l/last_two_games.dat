5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; {{there would not be}} another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Volunteers {{won their}} <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> {{of the regular}} season—against Vanderbilt and Kentucky—bringing them to a record of 7-5. At no time during the season was Tennessee ranked in the {{national}} top-25 polls, and Tennessee was never in consideration {{to play in the}} SEC Championship Game because of its early loss to Florida.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{missing the}} <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>game</b> of the season, Uteritz was {{selected}} as a second-team All-American by Lawrence Perry and a third-team selection by International News Service sports editor Davis Walsh.|$|R
25|$|The AEE and UEE {{began an}} annual series of matches {{against each other}} that {{continued}} until 1869. The fixture {{was the most important}} of the season while it <b>lasted.</b> <b>Two</b> <b>games</b> were played in 1857, both at Lord's and both won by the AEE.|$|R
5000|$|The Nordiques' first {{head coach}} was the legendary Maurice [...] "Rocket" [...] Richard but he <b>lasted</b> <b>two</b> <b>games,</b> a 2-0 {{loss to the}} Cleveland Crusaders, and a 6-0 win against the Alberta Oilers.

5|$|Lafont has {{represented}} France at various youth levels. He made six appearances for the France U16 team and captained the side on three separate occasions. He then made his debut for France U17 on 20 October 2015 against N. Ireland, keeping a clean sheet in the process. Lafont was, however, not selected for France's 2016 European Under-17 Championship squad after Toulouse lobbied {{for him to}} remain with the club for their <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the season to aid their relegation battle.|$|E
5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East. While they managed a single win against the Boston Red Sox, {{it was followed by}} a six-game losing streak wherein the Phillies were swept by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles; Philadelphia was outscored 38–19 over the two series. The team showed promise in the first game of their World Series rematch series with the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 10–1, but were defeated in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26. However, the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b> Happ played the role of stopper by pitching his first career complete game shutout, and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game. To close the month, the Phillies lost the opener of their next series with the Braves to finish the month with a 10–16 record.|$|E
5|$|These successes {{established}} Steinitz {{as one of}} the world's top players, and he {{was able}} to arrange a match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen, who was regarded as the world's strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior, Paul Morphy, had retired from competitive chess. Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses (there were no draws), but it was a hard fight; after 12 games the scores were level at 6–6, then Steinitz won the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E

50|$|Tebeau's {{major league}} career only <b>lasted</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> in July 1895 {{because he had}} already signed with the Portland club but failed to report. The Cleveland Spiders picked up and used Tebeau without {{knowledge}} of this. Portland's manager Frank Leonard saw {{his name in the}} newspaper (referred to as C.A. Tebeau) with Cleveland and filed a complaint. Before signing with Portland, Tebeau played for Lowell in the New England Association.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to Serie A in the 2007–08 season, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager. They finished {{in third place}} in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the 2008–09 season, before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Back in England for the 1929 season, Larwood {{made three}} Test {{appearances}} against the visiting South Africans, for modest returns: {{a total of}} eight wickets at 23.25, and with the bat 50 runs at 12.50. He was injured during the third Test, and thus missed the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the series and several county matches. His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years; with 117 wickets at 21.66 he fell to 25th place in the national averages. The 20-year-old Voce, whose fast-medium bowling style had now fully developed, was the county's most successful bowler. Together, Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last chance for them to redeem what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E
50|$|While the Bengals had <b>two</b> <b>games</b> {{cancelled}} (against the Milwaukee Chiefs {{and against}} the New York Yankees) in 1940, the Buffalo Indians were involved in <b>two</b> forfeits, the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> forfeited <b>games</b> {{in the history of}} major professional football.|$|R
50|$|Wearing the Number 2 jumper {{in which}} Roy Wright won two Brownlow medals, Stewart burned {{from the start}} of 1971 and rapidly gained {{favouritism}} to win another Brownlow Medal. Meanwhile, Barrot <b>lasted</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> with the Saints, was dropped and then cleared to Carlton by mid-season. There, he played a handful of games for the Tigers' old rivals, but had a physical confrontation with coach Ron Barassi at half time in the last round of the season, which resulted in Barrot walking away from VFL football forever.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} only <b>lasted</b> <b>two</b> <b>games,</b> although Merson only played {{once in the}} 2-1 home loss to Halifax Town, {{where it}} had to be said that Merson hardly looked like a player whose transfer fees total to a staggering £11,250,000 over his career, and the player looked a shadow of his former self, been easily knocked off the ball and a string of potential passes going a stray. Merson was dropped to the bench for the following game, which was a disappointing 5-0 defeat away to Grays Athletic.|$|R
5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the regular season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the regular season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the regular season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of {{the regular}} season, the Hokies managed two victories: a 14–3 win against last-place ACC team Duke, and a 17–14 triumph over {{traditional}} rival Virginia. Miami, meanwhile, lost its final two games of the season: against Georgia Tech and North Carolina State. These losses dropped Miami to a 4–4 record in the ACC, one game behind the Hokies, who were tied with Georgia Tech at 5–3 following the end {{of the regular}} season. By virtue of the Hokies' head-to-head win against the Yellow Jackets, Virginia Tech earned a spot in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Seemingly {{restored}} to full health, Bradman blazed two centuries in the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the tour. However, {{when he returned}} to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} was a let down year {{not only for}} Durant {{but also for the}} Roughriders as a whole. The Riders stumbled out of the gate losing seven of their first eight games. Durant's production fell significantly through the course of the season. Near {{the end of the season}} Durant was playing with a broken bone in his foot, which ultimately lead to him missing the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the regular season. The Riders would finish the year with only 5 wins and 13 loses, placing them in last place in the league. Despite the reduced production in 2011 on April 27, 2012 the Riders extended his contract through the 2014 CFL season.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland offense faced first-year {{defensive}} coordinator Nigel Burton's Nevada defense.

Nevada was ranked eighth in the number of quarterback sacks with 35. Kevin Basped, ranked tenth in the nation in sacks, and Dontay Moch, ranked fifteenth, accumulated more than nine each. Maryland quarterback Turner was sacked 11times in the Terrapins' <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> against Florida State and Boston College. Nevada was also ranked sixth nationally in tackles for loss, with an average of 8.0per game.|$|E
5|$|The NBA Finals was {{initially}} structured to harbor a 2–3–2 format until 2013, {{where the first}} two and <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the series were played at the arena of the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. This was then altered, because teams with the home-court advantage went 21–8 in all Finals appearances. The competition is currently structured under a 2–2–1–1–1 format, where {{the first two games}} are played at home for the higher-seeded team, and the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team. The following three are played at each team's home arena respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British football hooliganism lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting {{in the death of}} a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free.|$|E
5|$|After {{a number}} of {{coaching}} changes and roster moves in the offseason, including signing punter Horace Gillom and fullback Tony Adamle, the Browns began with a 30–14 win over the Buffalo Bills, {{the first of a}} string of five victories. The team lost its only game of the season to the Los Angeles Dons in October. Five more wins followed before a come-from-behind tie in November with the New York Yankees, the team Cleveland defeated in the 1946 AAFC championship. The Browns won their <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games,</b> including a 42–0 shutout against the Baltimore Colts in the finale, to set up a championship game rematch with the Yankees in December. Cleveland beat the Yankees 14–3 in New York on an icy field to win its second championship in a row.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E
