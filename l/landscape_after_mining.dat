The Thesis consists of general characteristics of the area, its natural conditions, recultivation development and the recultivation itself. The goal of the thesis was to analyze the changes in the <b>landscape</b> <b>after</b> <b>mining</b> and to evaluate the current recultivation plan.

30|$|This {{study is}} an initial trial {{to reflect the}} {{response}} of landscape indices to grain sizes, impacted by mining activities. It is believed that mining activities have a significant influence on landscape patterns, {{but there is no}} apparent difference between investment intensity and structural intensity. Mining activities force landscape patterns to fragmentation. This paper selected a series of grain sizes to seek their relationships with landscape indices in mineral resource zones. It is proven that <b>landscape</b> indices <b>after</b> intensive <b>mining</b> respond to grain sizes more greatly than before. The best first domain of scale covers 30 – 90  m, with a suitable grain size of 30 – 60  m before intensive mining and a suitable grain size of 60 – 90  m <b>after</b> intensive <b>mining,</b> which indicates that mining activities have forced surrounding landscapes to a more drastic change. In terms of the three aspects of disturbance, continuity and sustainability, the intensity of mining activities alters the shape, distribution and proximity relation of patches most, but the number and richness of landscape types cannot be primarily changed.|$|R
