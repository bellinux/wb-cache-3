5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} muscles of one limb, {{one side of the}} body or the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as {{it was supposed to}} convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but {{shared a common}} design approach. The {{entry-level}} XT featured a black plastic panel for {{the upper half of}} the dashboard, with either a black, charcoal, or beige panel for the <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b> Not all variants offered the distinctive colour palette; the sports variants could not be optioned with the two-tone interior.|$|E

5|$|Its {{dimensions}} are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably {{influenced by the}} geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on the <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba {{was greeted}} by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{civilian}} life, he resumed his farming career, but in 1948 became a priest. He shifted around the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the North Island {{for the next}} several years, serving in a number of churches. He was also a chaplain in the Territorial Force. He retired from the priesthood in 1981 and died eight years later at the age of 73.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times {{printed a}} display {{advertisement}} {{on its first}} page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper.

5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time.

5|$|Two aluminium-alloy {{castings}} {{joined together}} on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy), {{and part of the}} housing for the airscrew reduction gear. The <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters.|$|E

5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the Navajo Formation.|$|E

Since the matrix is symmetrical, only the <b>lower</b> triangular <b>half</b> actually needs to be filled in. The remaining cells are then simply the reciprocals of the <b>lower</b> triangular <b>half</b> (for example, because the rating of Temperature relative to Topography is 3, the rating of Topography relative to Temperature will be 1 / 3).|$|R
5|$|For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails {{offers a}} large, groomed trail system that also {{includes}} the <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the Auto Road. Several warming huts are scattered around the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks. Great Glen also permits biking on the trails during the summer, {{and is the only}} mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally {{finished in the}} <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or better.) With the exception of Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an afloat unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (<b>lower</b> <b>half).</b> In 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R. Castillo became the first Hispanic-American district commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E
5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. The <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
