ICP Forests and rolling National Forest Inventory (NFI) data have good potential for quantifying patterns in damage occurrence, but region-wise NFIs may produce biased results. ContextFactors affecting {{the occurrence of}} important biotic damage on Pinus sylvestris were studied with data from large-scale forest monitoring networks. AimsWe tested how much the {{probability of}} damage caused by <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies</b> (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr. and Diprion pini L.) and G. abietina (Lagerb. (Morelet)) differed between different forest site types {{and the effects of}} relevant climatic factors on damage probabilities. MethodsLong-term damage observations from ICP Forests Level 1 monitoring and National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were used. In addition to the traditional frequentist approach, we used a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) framework with the ICP Forests data to model the probabilities of <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> outbreaks starting and continuing. ResultsThe probability of <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> damage was highest in drier sites while the probabilities for G. abietina damage showed an opposite pattern. The HB analysis revealed clear differences between forest site types in the probability of outbreak starting, but the differences in the probabilities of outbreaks continuing were not clear.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and physiology}} of pheromone receptors on the antennae of male <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies,</b> Diprion pini L., were investigated. Using scanning electron microscopy, five sensillar types were recognized. The type {{shown to be}} pheromone sensitive has a long (50 - 70 mu m) cuticular hair, is single-walled, and is innervated by 8 or 9 sensory cells as revealed by transmission electronmicroscopy. Electroantennography (EAG) showed similar activity of the acetate and propionate of (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tridecanol, precursor of the main constituent of the female-produced sex pheromone. No other isomer induced any significant response. Single-sensillum recordings confirmed {{the results of the}} EAG, and also showed that several neurons were excited by the active compound. EAG recordings and combined gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection indicated that esters of three 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -pentadecanol (diprionol) isomers were active, but field tests could not demonstrate any behavioural effect. Diprionol esters are used as sex pheromones by all other <b>pine</b> <b>sawflies</b> investigated so far, and D. pini is thus the first diprionid species shown to use a different sex pheromone...|$|R

50|$|The European <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> is {{considered}} a pest as it eats a lot of needles. While this can stunt {{the growth of the}} tree, it rarely is enough to kill the tree.

Spraying is usually done very early, often when they're first spotted.|$|R

40|$|Electroantennographic {{and single}} {{sensillum}} recordings {{were performed on}} male <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Neodiprion sertifer, antennae. Responses to the sex pheromone component (2 S, 3 S, 7 S) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -pentadecenyl (diprionyl) acetate (SSS:OAc), to the behavioral inhibitor (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -diprionyl acetate (SRR:OAc), to the six other enantiomers of diprionyl acetate, and to the biosynthetic precursor diprionol were recorded. Responses to trans-perillenal, a monoterpene identified in female gland extracts and to (2 S, 3 S, 7 S) -diprionyl propionate (SSS:OPr), a field attractant for N. sertifer and some related sawfly species were also recorded. EAG recordings demonstrated a high antennal sensitivity to SSS:OAc and to SSS:OPr. A somewhat lower response was elicited by SRR:OAc. Single sensillum recordings revealed 8 - 12 different cells firing in each sensillum, corresponding {{to the number of}} cells observed in earlier morphological investigations. Out of these cells all, except one, responded to SSS:OAc and to SSS:OPr. No differences in the response to the two components could be observed. The largest amplitude cell in each sensillum was specifically tuned to the behavioral antagonist, SRR:OAc.

50|$|Sawflies {{are mostly}} herbivores, feeding on plants {{that have a}} high {{concentration}} of chemical defences. These insects are either resistant to the chemical substances, or they avoid areas of the plant that have high concentrations of chemicals. The larvae primarily feed in groups; they are folivores, eating plants and fruits on native trees and shrubs, though some are parasitic.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{identification}} of the sex pheromone in the <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Gilpinia pallida, including analysis of the female pheromone content, male antennal response and attraction in the field, and synthesis of the most active pheromone component. Several 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -alkanols were identified from female whole-body extracts, including some compounds with a 2 R configuration. This is the first observation of such compounds in a <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> species. Antennae of male G. pallida responded strongly in electroantennograph (EAG) recordings to the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomers of the propionates of 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tridecanol, 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tetradecanol, and 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -pentadecanol, {{as well as to the}} acetates of the tri- and pentadecanols (the acetate of the tetradecanol was not tested). The propionate of (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tetradecanol caught more males in the field than the corresponding isomer of tri- or pentadecanol. We suggest that the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer of 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tetradecanol is likely the main sex pheromone precursor in G. pallida, with a subsidiary role for the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer of the tridecanol. Preparation of highly pure (2 R, 3 R, 7 R) - and (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -stereoisomers of 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tetradecanol, including the biological active esters, was performed via chemoenzymatic methods and is described in detail...|$|R
50|$|Diprion pini, {{the common}} <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly,</b> is a sawfly {{species in the}} genus Diprion. It is a serious pest of {{economic}} forestry, capable of defoliating large areas of pine forest. Since it feeds {{until late in the}} autumn, affected trees are weakened and often die in the subsequent winter. The species is found all across Europe, with outliers elsewhere. It affects the Scots, mountain, eastern white, radiata, lodgepole and black pines. Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.|$|R
50|$|Mound-building, forest-dwelling Formica spp. such as F. rufa {{often have}} a {{considerable}} effect on their environments. They maintain large populations of aphids on the secretions of which they feed, and which the ants defend from other predators. They also prey on other insects. In fact in many countries they are introduced in forests to control tree pests, such as swains jack <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> and eastern tent caterpillars in North America. The effects of mound-building grassland species such as F. montana are not well-studied, but their local abundance, conspicuous mound-building and very frequent association with aphids and membracids points to a comparably important ecological role.|$|R
40|$|Population {{densities of}} forest defoliating insects may be {{regulated}} by small mammal predation on the pupae. When outbreaks do occur, they often coincide with warm, dry weather and at barren forest sites. A proposed {{reason for this}} is that weather and habitat affect small mammal population density (numerical response) and hence pupal predation. We propose an alternative explanation: weather and habitat affect small mammal feeding behaviour (functional response) and hence the outbreak risks of forest pest insects. We report results from laboratory and field-enclosure experiments estimating rates of pupal predation by bank voles (Myodes glareolus) on an outbreak insect, the European <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Neodiprion sertifer), at different temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C), in different microhabitats (sheltered and non-sheltered), and with or without access to alternative food (sunflower seeds). We found that the probability of a single pupa being eaten at 20 A degrees C was lower than at 15 A degrees C (0. 49 and 0. 72, respectively). Pupal predation was higher in the sheltered microhabitat than in the open one, and the behaviour of the voles differed between microhabitats. More pupae were eaten in situ in the sheltered microhabitat whereas in the open area more pupae were removed and eaten elsewhere. Access to alternative food did not affect pupal predation. The results suggest that predation rates on <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> pupae by voles are influenced by temperature- and habitat-induced variation in the physiology and behaviour of the predator, and not necessarily solely through effects on predator densities as previously proposed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} if coarse-resolution {{satellite data}} from the MODIS sensor {{can be used for}} regional monitoring of insect disturbances in Fennoscandia. A damage detection method based on z-scores of seasonal maximums of the 2 -band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI 2) was developed. Time-series smoothing was applied and Receiver Operating Characteristics graphs were used for optimisation. The method was developed in fragmented and heavily managed forests in eastern Finland dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (pinaceae) and with defoliation of European <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr.) (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae) and common <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Diprion pini L.) (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae). The method was also applied to subalpine mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. Czerepanovii N. I. Orlova) forests in northern Sweden, infested by autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata Borkhausen) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.). In Finland, detection accuracies were fairly low with 50 % of the damaged stands detected, and a misclassification of healthy stands of 22 %. In areas with long outbreak histories the method resulted in extensive misclassification. In northern Sweden accuracies were higher, with 75 % of the damage detected and a misclassification of healthy samples of 19 %. Our results indicate that MODIS data may fail to detect damage in fragmented forests, particularly when the damage history is long. Therefore, regional studies based on these data may underestimate defoliation. However, the method yielded accurate results in homogeneous forest ecosystems and when long-enough periods without damage could be identified. Furthermore, the method is likely to be useful for insect disturbance detection using future medium-resolution data, e. g. from Sentinel- 2...|$|R
