Angelou {{read through the}} Bible twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it. African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, {{in the activities of}} the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture. Hagen {{goes on to say that}} in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In Caged Bird, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Mother Wit", which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in folklore and humor.|$|E
500|$|John's chosen heir was {{his fourth}} son, Manuel I Komnenos. According to Niketas Choniates, a {{historian}} of Byzantium, Manuel was chosen over his elder surviving brother {{because of his}} ability to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>to</b> advice. Manuel was known for his lively and charismatic personality; he was known for his love for all things from Western Europe. Manuel arranged jousting matches, even participating in them, an unusual experience for the Byzantines. [...] Manuel himself is generally considered the most brilliant of the four emperors of the Komnenos dynasty; unusual for a Byzantine ruler, his reputation was particularly good in the west and the Crusader states, especially after his death. The Latin historian William of Tyre described Manuel as [...] "beloved of God... a great-souled man of incomparable energy", [...] "memory will ever be held in benediction". Manuel was further extolled by Robert of Clari as a [...] "generous and worthy man".|$|E

The singer would usually show up at the concert venue at the last minute, walk out on stage and start to sing, having never heard the sound system. Presley {{sometimes}} turned {{to the side of the}} stage to ask Jackson to make changes, and a few times he stopped the show to have Jackson come out and stand center stage and <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>to</b> the monitors while Presley sang to 20,000 people. One night in Fort Worth, Texas, Presley led the audience in singing [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in honour of the engineer's birthday—an [...] "amazing, and very embarrassing" [...] occasion for Jackson. Jackson can be seen at his side-stage mix position in Presley's 1977 [...] "CBS Special" [...] TV show.

2500|$|With the {{commencement}} of hearings {{in the case of}} Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services (Case #98-916V), the argument over whether autism is a vaccine injury moved into the vaccine court. [...] A panel of three special masters began hearing the first cases of the historic Omnibus Autism Proceedings in June 2007. There were six test cases in all, and the entire record of the cases is publicly available. The lead petitioners, the parents of Michelle Cedillo, claimed that Michelle's autism was caused by a vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo contended that thiomersal seriously weakened Michelle's immune system and prevented her body from clearing the measles virus after her vaccination at the age of fifteen months. At the outset Special Master George Hastings, Jr. said [...] "Clearly the story of Michelle's life is a tragic one," [...] while pledging to <b>listen</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>to</b> the evidence. On February 12, 2009, the court ruled in three test cases that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thiomersal-containing vaccines were not to blame for autism. Hastings concluded in his decision, [...] "Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment." [...] The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and upheld.|$|E

Of the struggle which ensued between her sense of duty and my persuasions I say nothing. She was a highly sensitive and very intellectual woman, and she had a profound conviction of the unalienable right of a woman to live out her life to its fullest capacity, to gather into it to the full all that is best and greatest. Her position at Waldenburg was impossible. I proved it to her. I prevailed. But----" ...|$|E
