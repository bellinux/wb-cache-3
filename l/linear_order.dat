25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (<b>linear</b> <b>order)</b> is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on hierarchical order {{in a manner that is}} hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.|$|E

While containment of the nonemptiness problem in EXPTIME is known for finite <b>linear</b> <b>orders</b> and actually for arbitrary finite structures, it is not obvious for infinite <b>linear</b> <b>orders.</b> It sharply contrasts the situation on other infinite structures; for example, the datalog nonemptiness problem on an infinite successor structure is undecidable.

25|$|The {{representations}} in (a–d) are trees, {{whereby the}} specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are dependency edges and lightly dotted lines are projection lines. The {{only difference between}} tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels. Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> and reflects just hierarchical order. The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by Word Grammar. The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words. Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from <b>linear</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} {{and importance of}} c-command for the theory of syntax is a debated issue. In most cases, c-command correlates positively with precedence (<b>linear</b> <b>order),</b> that is, when node A c-commands node B, {{it is usually the}} case that node A also precedes node B. Furthermore, basic S(V)O (subject-verb-object) word order in English correlates positively with a hierarchy of syntactic functions, subjects outranking objects. Subjects typically precede objects in declarative sentences in English and related languages. These two insights suggest that theories of syntax that build on c-command have misconstrued the importance of precedence and/or the hierarchy of syntactic functions. What c-command is intended to address is arguably more accurately analyzed in terms of precedence and the syntactic functions. Further, the c-command concept was developed primarily with its ability to address syntactic phenomena of English, a language with relatively strict word order. When confronted with the much freer word order of many other languages, the insights provided by c-command are less compelling, since <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> becomes less important.|$|E

The theorem holds for a restricted case in which <b>linear</b> <b>orders</b> are the only non-unary relations. Recently, a contrasting result has been shown, that the finite satisfiability problem for FO 2 with two <b>linear</b> <b>orders</b> and with no additional non-unary relations is decidable. We observe that our proof {{can be adapted to}} some interesting fragments of FO 2, in particular it works for the two-variable guarded fragment, GF 2, even if the order relations are used only as guards.

Using Courcelle's characterization of algebraic trees, we obtain the fact that a <b>linear</b> <b>ordering</b> is algebraic if and only if it can be represented as the lexicographic ordering of a deterministic context-free language. When the algebraic <b>linear</b> <b>ordering</b> is a well-ordering, its order type is an algebraic ordinal.

25|$|As just suggested, the {{phenomena}} that c-command {{is intended to}} address may be more plausibly examined in terms of <b>linear</b> <b>order</b> and a hierarchy of syntactic functions. Concerning the latter, some theories of syntax take a hierarchy of syntactic functions to be primitive. This is true of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), and dependency grammars (DGs). The hierarchy of syntactic functions that these frameworks posit is usually something like the following: SUBJECT > FIRST OBJECT > SECOND OBJECT > OBLIQUE OBJECT. Numerous mechanisms of syntax are then addressed {{in terms of this}} hierarchy.|$|E

More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references.|$|E
