5|$|The limpkin {{is an odd}} {{bird that}} looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America and {{southern}} Florida.|$|E
5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E

The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> sort of dog.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> cocker spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E
50|$|The {{orange-breasted falcon}} (Falco deiroleucus) is a bird of the falcon family. It is {{probably}} {{closely related to}} and looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> version of the bat falcon. These two, in turn, are probably closest to the aplomado falcon and constitute a rather old American lineage of Falcos.|$|R

50|$|Like other macraucheniids, X. bahiensis {{had a small}} proboscis, or trunk, {{and three}} toes on each foot. This animal was an {{herbivore}} that averaged around five meters in length, and was approximately three meters in height. In life, X. bahiensis probably looked very much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> version of Macrauchenia, that is, vaguely <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very tall, humpless camel with a small, tapir-like trunk.|$|R
5|$|The Moderate Party has a pro-European Union policy stance—including {{support for}} exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also {{supports}} Sweden joining NATO. As one of Europe's new conservative leaders, Reinfeldt {{is seen as}} an important ally of the United States. His party {{is a member of the}} conservative International Democrat Union, together with the Republican Party in the United States and the British Conservative Party, even though its policies are somewhat more liberal than these. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004, Reinfeldt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry.|$|E

The {{purpose was to}} determine the effects of underwater shock on equipment in preparation for the larger surface shots. The crew reported the blast sounding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hammer hitting the ship that caused the floor to move out from under their feet and paint to flake off of piping and bulkheads.|$|E
25|$|The Powder River basin {{is shaped}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> shallow bowl, with its westernmost rock {{formations}} lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As these mountains uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted and tilted the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, {{which were then}} eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.|$|E

Styled <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> version of the Taurus, the Crown Victoria borrowed a nameplate from the mid-1950s Ford lineup. Many features, such as four-wheel disc brakes, ABS, and dual airbags were all-new, and the Windsor V8 {{was replaced}} by the Modular V8, the first overhead-cam V8 in an American full-sized sedan.|$|R

25|$|General ledger is {{the term}} for the {{comprehensive}} collection of T-accounts (so called {{because there was a}} pre-printed vertical line in the middle of each ledger page and a horizontal line at the top of each ledger page, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> letter T). Before the advent of computerised accounting, manual accounting procedure used a book (known as a ledger) for each T-account. The collection of all these books was called the general ledger.|$|E
25|$|The limpkin (Aramus guarauna), {{also called}} carrao, courlan, and crying bird, is {{a bird that}} looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> rail but is skeletally closer to cranes. It is the only extant species in the genus Aramus and the family Aramidae. It is found mostly in {{wetlands}} in warm parts of the Americas, from Florida to northern Argentina. It feeds on molluscs, with the diet dominated by apple snails of the genus Pomacea. Its name derives from its seeming limp when it walks.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian Room / Shoe Room Genevieve and Miriam Lynch had {{a fondness}} {{for the study of}} Egypt and this flat smooth desert like room {{reminded}} them of a pyramid. Within the rocks of the room they saw King Tutankhamen’s Sarcophagus, The Sphinx’s Nose, Arrow Head Entry, and Cleopatra’s Sandal. The ceiling is shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> sandal or shoe, leading some to call it the Shoe Room. The flat smooth ceiling was once mistaken for Marble.|$|E

25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Irish tales {{depict the}} Dagda {{as a figure}} of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the chalky soil. While this was {{probably}} produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long {{thought to be a}} representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show {{that there may have been}} a representation of what looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> drapery hanging from the horizontal arm of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup.|$|E
50|$|An anticupola can't be {{constructed}} with all regular faces, although some {{can be made}} regular. If the top n-gon and triangles are regular, the base 2n-gon can not be planar and regular. In such a case, n=6 generates a regular hexagon and surrounding equilateral triangles of a snub hexagonal tiling, which can be closed into a zero volume polygon with the base a symmetric 12-gon shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> hexagon, having adjacent pairs of colinear edges.|$|R

This large capacitor greatly decreases the bandwidth of the amplifier as it makes the time constant of the parasitic input RC filter [...] where [...] is the output impedance of the signal source connected to the ideal base.|$|R
50|$|Pearls come {{in eight}} basic shapes: round, semi-round, button, drop, pear, oval, baroque, circled and double bouldered. Perfectly round pearls are the rarest and most {{valuable}} shape. Semi-rounds {{are also used}} in necklaces or in pieces where {{the shape of the}} pearl can be disguised to look <b>like</b> it is <b>a</b> perfectly round pearl. Button pearls are <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slightly flattened round pearl and can also make a necklace, but are more often used in single pendants or earrings where the back half of the pearl is covered, making it look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> rounder pearl.|$|R
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Polygynous marriages can be {{distinguished}} between sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters, and non-sororal, where the co-wives are not related. For men, the benefits of polygyny are that {{it allows them to}} have more children, may provide them with more productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when their work load is lightened by the addition of junior wives to the family. Wives', especially senior wives', status in the community can be increased by the addition of other wives, who add to the family's prosperity or are a sign of conspicuous consumption (much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> house, domestic help, or expensive vacations would be in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for a second wife.|$|E
25|$|The Corinthian Order {{does not}} have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew {{directly}} out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals. The capital was very much deeper than either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> krater, a bell-shaped mixing bowl, and being ornamented with a double row of acanthus leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting {{the corners of the}} abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to Vitruvius, the capital was invented by a bronze founder, Callimachus of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it. The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.|$|E
