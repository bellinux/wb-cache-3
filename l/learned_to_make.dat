At the age of 17 he became a journeyman bookbinder and plied his trade {{from town to town}} and job to job, working in 50 cities in 6 countries from 1863 to 1868. In Vienna he was fired and placed on a blacklist for having staged a strike.

25|$|The banjo {{player and}} fiddler Bascom Lamar Lunsford, {{a native of}} the North Carolina mountains, {{collected}} much traditional music during his lifetime, also founding the old-time music festival in Asheville, North Carolina. Notable North Carolina traditional banjo players and makers include Frank Proffitt, Frank Proffitt, Jr. and Stanley Hicks, who all <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and play fretless mountain banjos from a family tradition. These players, among others, learned their art primarily from family and show fewer traces of influence from commercial hillbilly recordings. The Proffitts and Hicks were heirs to a centuries-old folk tradition, and through the middle to late 20th century and they continued to perform in a style older than the stringbands often associated with old time music. Their style has been recently emulated by contemporary musician Tim Eriksen.|$|E
25|$|Muskox Ovibos moschatus (umingmar, maskar in Nunivak Cup'ig). Alaska's {{original}} muskox were hunted {{to extinction}} in the mid-1800s - perhaps by whalers and others. They had originally ranged Alaska's arctic and western coastal tundra. In 1935-1936 the U.S. Biological Survey brought 31 muskoxen from Greenland to Nunivak Island {{in an effort}} to reestablish the species in Alaska and as a means for subsistence living. Because the animals were federally protected, and since the Nunivaarmiut were afraid of them, they added nothing to the local economy until 40 years later. when Nunivak women <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fine items of clothing from the underwool of the muskox (qiviut). The muskox are large animals that look a lot like bison, but have wool like sheep, and has a two-layered coat, and qiviut refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The first modern hunting season was in 1975. Today the Nunivak herd numbers around 600 animals, down from a high of around 700 animals in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure all elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E

A gifted teacher, he eventually became the Mufti of Egypt. 'Abduh cultivated reason and held the controversial view that in Muslim law the doors of ijtihad were open, i.e., permitting the <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an original interpretation of sacred texts. 'Abduh visited Tunisia twice. Together al-Afghani and 'Abduh have been called [...] "the two founders of Islamic modernism".|$|E

2500|$|Caine leased Castlerigg Cottage in Keswick in 1888. The {{following}} year Caine bought Hawthorns out {{of part of}} his earnings from Ben-my-Chree. Hawthorns was a small square-built stone house on the Penrith Road, a mile outside Keswick, overlooking Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater. [...] Caine also rented a Pied-à-terre at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London. [...] Hawthorns was close to Chesnut Cottage that Shelley had rented in 1811 and Greta Hall home of the poets Coleridge and Southey. The house had ten acres of land where Caine kept two ponies he had transported from Iceland. [...] Mary <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> butter and cheese.

2500|$|After an {{apprenticeship}} to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey {{founded a}} candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> caramel. After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 {{he founded the}} Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful, and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines {{for the first time}} at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000 (equal to $ today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, [...] "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|She was christened [...] "Carmen" [...] by {{her father}} because of his love for Bizet's operatic masterpiece. This passion for opera {{influenced}} his children, and Miranda's love for singing and dancing, at an early age. She was educated at the Convent of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Her father did not approve of Miranda's plans to enter show business; her mother supported her, despite being beaten when her father discovered that his daughter had auditioned for a radio show (she had sung at parties and festivals in Rio). Miranda's older sister, Olinda, developed tuberculosis and was sent to Portugal for treatment; the singer worked in a tie shop at age 14 to help pay her sister's medical bills. She then worked in a boutique (where she <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> hats), and opened a successful hat business.|$|E
2500|$|In technology, the Abbasids adopted {{papermaking}} from China. The use {{of paper}} spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) {{and then the}} rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than parchment, less likely to crack than papyrus, and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and making copies of the Koran. [...] "Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries." [...] It was from the Abbasids {{that the rest of the}} world <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> paper from linen. [...] The knowledge of gunpowder was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure potassium nitrate and an explosive gunpowder effect were first developed.|$|E
2500|$|Russians {{seem to have}} <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> pelmeni from Finnic and Tatar {{peoples of}} the Taiga, the Urals and Siberia.

[...] In Siberia they were made in large quantities and stored safely frozen outside for several winter months. [...] In mainland Russia, the term [...] "Siberian Pel'meni" [...] refers to pel'meni made {{with a mix of}} meats (whether the 45/35/20 mix mentioned above, or another ratio), rather than a single meat. By the late 19th century, they became a staple throughout urban European Russia. They are prepared immediately before eating by boiling in water until they float, and then 2–5 minutes more. The resulting dish is served with butter or sour cream (mustard, horseradish, and vinegar are popular as well). Some recipes suggest frying pelmeni after boiling until they turn golden brown.|$|E

2500|$|New {{processes}} that sped {{the production of}} chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Known as [...] "Dutch cocoa", this machine-pressed chocolate {{was instrumental in the}} transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, Joseph Fry <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> chocolate moldable by adding back melted cacao butter. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.|$|E
2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb {{as a little}} girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, while {{preparing}} a recital program for her master's degree, Blackwell auditioned for the Broadway revival of West Side Story. Impressed with her audition, Leonard Bernstein hand picked {{her for the}} role of Francisca (formerly named Consuela in the original 1957 production) and the understudy for Maria in the 1980 revival. As Francisca, Blackwell sang the song Somewhere from the orchestra pit during the final scene of the musical. For the next two-and-a-half years she toured with the show, gaining skills no operatic training could have provided. Blackwell said, [...] "I learned about characterization, how you went about becoming that person", she said. [...] "I learned stamina, how to do eight shows a week. And I <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the stage my home, where I felt 100 percent comfortable." [...] At the show's premiere, critics remarked how similar Blackwell sounded to opera singer Reri Grist who originated the role of Consuela. Coincidentally, Blackwell met and befriended Grist in 1985 when she coached Blackwell for her European debut as Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera with the Hamburg State Opera. She repeated that role the following year at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.|$|E
