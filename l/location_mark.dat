5000|$|Principal {{photography}} began September 2009 in Mount Clemens, Michigan. The closed Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan (Greater Detroit) {{was used}} as a filming <b>location.</b> <b>Mark</b> Binelli, author of Detroit City is the Place to Be, wrote that the school cafeteria {{was used as}} the catering hall for the employees. According to photographs taken on set, the film features propaganda pamphlets, posters, and banners featuring People's Liberation Army symbols, such as the August 1 star. The posters attempt to garner support for a Chinese occupation, with slogans such as [...] "Rebuilding Your Reputation", [...] "Repairing Your Economy", and [...] "Fighting Corporate Corruption".|$|E
5000|$|The series finale, [...] "The Last Gig", {{found the}} band {{on the verge}} of embarking on new {{crossroads}} in life. Set months after the characters graduated from the fictional Pacific Coast High School in [...] "Graduation" [...] (which aired three episodes earlier), the episode deals with the band preparing to attend school separately the following week (with Tiffani planning to attend the University of Hawaii to study marine biology, Sam moving to England to study physics at Oxford University, Tony going to study acting at an undisclosed <b>location,</b> <b>Mark</b> planning to move back home to New York to study at Juilliard, and Sly and Lorena both attending Pacific University). While the other members look forward to start their new lives, Jake attempts to keep the band together. When a music producer offers Jake a record contract, he initially refuses, since the rest of the band was not given one as well. Tiffani convinces Jake that she and the other band members have moved past the Dreams and want to discover new things, convincing Jake to take the offer. The episode ends with the California Dreams playing their final gig, before giving their tearful goodbyes to one another.|$|E

40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of electronic technology, automatic detection of the PCB board has become particularly important, {{and the key}} step of the detection is to identify and locate the <b>location</b> <b>mark</b> (usually it is a round). Hough transform {{is one of the}} most widely used circle detection method, but it is complex in computing and requires much resource. For these conditions, a new idea of circle detection is proposed to get the rough location of the circle with the template matching, and then the precise positioning is accomplished by an improved Hough transform which is to draw two non-parallel strings on the orientation round and the center of the circle shall locate the strings ’ perpendicular intersection. Experiments show that the method is simple and effective, and can accomplish the PCB image positioning accurately...|$|E
40|$|For Mark I, II, and III- pressure-suppression type {{boiling water}} reactor (BWR) plant containments, the CSB review covers the {{following}} areas: 1. The temperature and pressure conditions in the drywell and wetwell due to a spectrum (including break size and location) of postulated loss-of-coolant accidents. 2. The differential pressure across the operating deck for a spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents including break size and <b>location</b> (<b>Mark</b> II containments only). 3. Suppression pool dynamic effects during a loss-of-coolant accident or following the actuation {{of one or more}} reactor coolant system safety/relief valves, including vent clearing, vent interactions, pool swell, pool strati-fication, and dynamic symmetrical and asymmetrical loads on suppression pool and other containment structures. 4. The consequences of a loss-of-coolant accident occurring within the containment (wetwell); i. e., outside the drywell (Mark III containments only) 5. The capability of the containment to withstand the effects of steam bypassing the suppression pool. 6. The external pressure capability of the drywell and wetwell, and systems that may be provided to limit external pressures...|$|E
40|$|Karyotype of M. curema {{from the}} Gulf of Mexico and Brazil have been {{reported}} as possessing chromosome complement with 2 n= 28 and FN= 48, whereas specimens from Venezuela has been reported as possessing a diploid number 2 n= 24 and a conserved FN (48). Although at first sight this variation suggests {{the presence of a}} chromosomal intraspecific (interpopulational) variability, the possibility that we are dealing with two different species was examined. This work revisit the karyotypes of M. curema from Venezuela and Brazil, including new data on C-banding, and NOR localization, and compares morphologic characteristics of samples from both localities. Thus, besides diploid number, the constitutive heterochromatin distribution and NORs <b>location,</b> <b>mark</b> other differences between M. curema Cytotype 1 (2 n= 28; FN= 48) and Cytotype 2 (2 n= 24; NF= 48). Moreover, morphologic comparison revealed differences in the scale counts and pectoral fin rays: 35 scales in the middle body line and 15 pectoral fin rays in specimens possessing the karyotype 2 n= 28, compared with 37 - 39 scales in the middle body line and 17 pectoral fin rays in specimens with the karyotype 2 n= 24. These differences lead us to suggest that both cytotypes are not related merely to geographic polytipic variations but could correspond to different species...|$|E

40|$|The {{running time}} of a quantum walk search {{algorithm}} depends on both {{the structure of the}} search space (graph) and the configuration of <b>marked</b> <b>locations.</b> While the first dependence have been studied in a number of papers, the second dependence remains mostly unstudied. We study search by quantum walks on two-dimensional grid using the algorithm of Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh [AKR 05]. The original paper analyses one and two <b>marked</b> <b>location</b> cases only. We move beyond two <b>marked</b> <b>locations</b> and study the behaviour of the algorithm for an arbitrary configuration of <b>marked</b> <b>locations.</b> In this paper we prove two results showing the importance of how the <b>marked</b> <b>locations</b> are arranged. First, we present two placements of k <b>marked</b> <b>locations</b> for which the number of steps of the algorithm differs by Ω(√(k)) factor.
