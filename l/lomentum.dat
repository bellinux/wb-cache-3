Vexillum {{is longer than}} the wings, with an obtuse keel longer or rarely shorter than the wings. Stamens are diadelphous, 9+1, and anthers uniform. Ovary is 2-8-ovuled. Fruit is a <b>lomentum,</b> with {{segments}} that are glabrous, pubescent, bristly, or spiny.|$|E

Stamens 10 or 9, monadelphous or diadelphous and then the vexillar stamen free, rarely all free; anthers uniform or unequal, 2 -celled, dorsifixed or basifixed, opening by longitudinal dehiscence.
