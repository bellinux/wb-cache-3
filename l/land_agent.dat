5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a <b>land</b> <b>agent</b> named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E

5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a <b>land</b> <b>agent</b> {{newly arrived}} in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
