40|$|High {{pressure}} screw plug (also called breech lock) exchangers are {{arguably the most}} complicated bolted connection in a refinery. After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B style shell leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these connections operate <b>leak</b> <b>free,</b> and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers. In order to obtain reliable <b>leak</b> <b>free</b> performance, all the basic sealing tools must be employed, including: 1. A spreadsheet that will easily analyze the critical variables; 2.

40|$|AbstractA novel coupled TOUGHREACT-Geochemist Workbench (GWB) {{model has}} been {{developed}} to predict changes of the isotopic composition of CO 2 resulting from reactive transport during leakage of CO 2 from a storage reservoir.

Perl scripts were developed to take input and output data from TOUGHREACT and create input files for GWB for subsequent modeling of the isotopic composition of leaking CO 2. Using this approach, we simulated the extent of changes of the isotopic composition of leaking CO 2 at 1000 T/y and 100 Darcy permeability for the first 10 cells extending from the Basal Cambrian Sandstone to just above the overlying Winnipegosis. Initial {{results indicate that the}} <b>leaking</b> <b>free</b> gas phase had δ 13 C values of CO 2 within 1 ‰ of that of the injected CO 2. δ 18 O values of leaking CO 2 showed more pronounced changes since they are controlled by oxygen isotope ratios of formation water and significant equilibrium isotope fractionation between CO 2 and H 2 O.

An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan and oral Gastrografin meal revealed a dilated stomach and proximal duodenum due to compression of the third part of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and aorta.

40|$|Permeability {{characteristics}} of the membrane lesion generated by the terminal complement proteins are considered {{in light of recent}} observations that the measured diffusion of solute across complement-damaged membranes does not conform to the "doughnut hole" model of a discrete transmembrane pore formed by the inserted C 5 b- 9 complex. By using the measured kinetics of steady-state tracer isotope diffusion of nonelectrolytes across resealed erythrocyte ghost membranes treated with C 5 b- 9, a new transport model is developed. This model considers the apparent membrane lesion strictly in terms of the operational criteria of a functional conducting pathway for the observed diffusing solute, independent of a priori assumptions about the geometry or molecular properties of the membrane lesion. With this definition of the unit membrane lesion and the assumption that the exclusion size of the conducting pathway varies directly with the multiplicity of bound C 5 b- 9 (as suggested by previous measurements under conditions of varying input of C 5 b- 9), numerical estimates of te apparent permeability of the complement-damaged membrane to four diffusing nonelectrolytes are derived. These results suggest that the pathway for a particle diffusing across the complement lesion cannot be a pore and is functionally equivalent to an aqueous <b>leak</b> pathway, <b>free</b> of pore constraints. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of current molecular models for the mechanism of membrane damage by the complement proteins...|$|R

Such surgical innovation {{is likely to be}} reported in case series, retrospective cohorts, or case-control studies rather than higher level evidence. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Embase (1980 -December 7, 2010) and MEDLINE (1950 -November 14, 2010) were searched using a search strategy designed to include any publication on endoscopic endonasal reconstruction of the skull base. A title search selected those articles relevant to the clinical or basic science of an endoscopic approach. A subsequent abstract search selected articles of any defect other than simple cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, sella only, meningoceles, or simple case reports. The articles selected were subject to full-text review to extract data on perioperative outcomes for ESBR. Surgical technique was used for subgroup analysis. Results: There were 4, 770 articles selected initially, and full-text analysis produced 38 studies with extractable data regarding ESBR. Of these articles, 12 described a vascularized reconstruction, 17 described free graft, and nine were mixed reconstructions. Three had mixed data in clearly defined patient groups {{that could be used for}} meta-analysis. The overall CSF leak rate was 11. 5 % (70 / 609). This was represented as a 15. 6 % leak rate (51 / 326) for free grafts and a 6. 7 % leak rate (19 / 283) for the vascularized reconstructions (χ² = 11. 88, P =. 001).

40|$|In utero {{undernutrition}} {{is associated}} with increased risk for insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular disease during adult life. A common phenotype associated with low birth weight is reduced skeletal muscle mass. Given {{the central role of}} skeletal muscle in whole body metabolism, we hypothesized that predisposition to metabolic disease is, in part, due to low oxidative capacity and dysfunctional mitochondrial energetics in muscle. We used an experimental mouse model system of maternal undernutrition during late pregnancy to examine female offspring from undernourished dams (U) and control offspring from ad libitum fed dams (C). U have increased adiposity and decreased glucose tolerance compared to C. Strikingly, when U are put on a 4 week 40 % calorie restricted diet they lose half as much weight as calorie restricted controls. Skeletal muscle mitochondria from U have decreased coupled and uncoupled respiration and increased maximal respiration compared to C. In permeabilized fiber preparations from mixed fiber type muscle, U have decreased mitochondrial content and decreased adenylate <b>free</b> <b>leak</b> respiration, fatty acid oxidative capacity, and state 3 respiratory capacity through complex I. Fiber maximal oxidative phosphorylation capacity does not differ between U and C. We next aimed to determine if the impaired skeletal muscle energetics observed in U also exist in primary muscle cells derived from these mice. We measured oxidative and glycolytic capacities in primary myotubes from U and C using cellular bioenergetics. Myotubes from U have decreased resting respiration and increased glycolysis compared to myotubes from C. There was no difference in myotube mitochondrial content. Findings suggest that undernutrition in utero causes a primary muscle defect. Energetics in cardiac muscle were also examined. U have impaired cardiac muscle homogenate energetics, including decreased fatty acid oxidative capacity, decreased maximum oxidative phosphorylation rate, and decreased proton leak respiration. Additionally, we measured plasma acylcarnitine levels and found that short-chain acylcarnitines are increased in U. Overall, results reveal that in utero undernutrition alters metabolic physiology through a profound effect on skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle energetics. These effects may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms which could be explored in future research...|$|R
