5|$|All Souls {{suffered}} from low viewership, and {{was placed on}} hiatus following the broadcast of the fist two episodes.

25|$|In the Discourses, love is {{mentioned}} in many forms. Love pervades the universe. The first fundamental force {{known to have}} split as an independent principle from the original primordial unity in recent Cosmology is gravity. Baba says that gravity is the reflection of <b>love.</b> <b>All</b> the forces of attraction and of repulsion in every level (from small particles to material objects to living organisms) are expressions of love. In the animal kingdom this love becomes explicit in conscious processes through instinctive drives. The drive to look for nutrition is love. Sex-attraction is love. Actually anything that drives an organism to fulfill a bodily impulse or desire is love.|$|E
25|$|Karl Barth reinterpreted the Reformed {{doctrine}} of predestination to {{apply only to}} Christ. Individual people are only said to be elected through their being in Christ. Reformed theologians who followed Barth, including Jürgen Moltmann, David Migliore, and Shirley Guthrie, {{have argued that the}} traditional Reformed concept of predestination is speculative and have proposed alternative models. These theologians claim that a properly trinitarian doctrine emphasizes God's freedom to <b>love</b> <b>all</b> people, rather than choosing some for salvation and others for damnation. God's justice towards and condemnation of sinful people is spoken of by these theologians as out of his love for them and a desire to reconcile them to himself.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{commentators}} {{discussing the}} lyrical themes, Mark Hertsgaard writes that Harrison's [...] "response to the fleetingness of time was to affirm and celebrate life: 'make <b>love</b> <b>all</b> day long / make love singing songs'", while Robert Rodriguez describes [...] "Love You To" [...] as [...] "a somewhat oblique expression of love directed toward his bride, along with larger concerns regarding mortality and purpose". In Ian Inglis' estimation, the lyrics [...] "remind {{us that in}} a world of material dissatisfaction and moral disharmony, there is always the solace of sexual pleasure".|$|E

500|$|On May 11, 1988, Mirth & Girth was {{displayed}} at a private exhibition {{in one of the}} school's main interior hallways.

Another of his works was a self-portrait titled [...] "I'm Sensitive, and I <b>Love</b> <b>All</b> Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities. As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting.

[...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae.

500|$|Critics heavily {{compared}} the storyline {{of the music}} video {{to that of the}} 2005 film, Brokeback Mountain. Birmingham Mails Luke Beardsworth described it as a [...] "lighthearted parody" [...] of the film and according to him the visual depicts Williams and Barlow as young cowboys who are in love secretly. Cragg noted that the video features [...] "the two men gaze lovingly into each other's eyes, strip to the waist and fall in <b>love</b> <b>all</b> over again." [...] Thompson thought that it is [...] "a tongue-in cheek nod" [...] to Brokeback Mountain, and wrote that [...] "they are seen stealing admiring glances at each other" [...] just like actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger in the film. According to The Sun the video likens the love-hate relationship that Williams and Barlow experienced to the film's [...] "tormented" [...] gay cowboys.|$|E

He was surprised at how popular Leon had become, praising his later evolution into a [...] "cool looking guy" [...] for Resident Evil 4 and adding that he [...] "fell in <b>love</b> <b>all</b> over again". Leon was created for Resident Evil 2 as the staff wanted to use a character who had no experience with terrifying situations in contrast to using returning protagonists. While he was originally designed as a veteran police officer, he was changed to a rookie after the original version of Resident Evil 2 (popularly known as [...] "Resident Evil 1.5") had been scrapped. Leon's design was inspired by the bloodhound of Capcom artist Isao Ohishi.|$|E
