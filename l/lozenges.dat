5|$|Zinc <b>lozenges</b> {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies {{suggesting}} that they may reduce the duration of the common cold. Due to wide differences between the studies, further research may be needed to determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc <b>lozenges</b> may produce side effects, and there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the common cold. Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} geometrical {{forms in}} Islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and <b>lozenges</b> containing squares. These date from 836 in the Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, {{and since then}} have spread all across the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate <b>lozenges</b> in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E

50|$|A <b>lozenge</b> (◊), often {{referred}} to as a diamond, is a form of rhombus. The definition of <b>lozenge</b> is not strictly fixed, and it is sometimes used simply as a synonym (from the French losange) for rhombus. Most often, though, <b>lozenge</b> refers to a thin rhombus - a rhombus with acute angles of less than 45°. The <b>lozenge</b> shape is often used in parquetry and as decoration on ceramics, silverware and textiles. It also features in heraldry and playing cards.|$|R
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and <b>lozenges</b> in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|William's feast day {{is celebrated}} on 8 June, {{the day of}} his death, {{although}} his veneration is largely localised to York. Traditional iconography and windows often depict William's crossing of the Tweed; some iconography shows him crossing in a boat. William's coat of arms traditionally depicts seven mascles or <b>lozenges.</b> St William's College, which was named for him is next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 with the permission of King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral. His remains were rediscovered in the 1960s and are now in the crypt at York Minster.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with a patch of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden <b>lozenges</b> and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
50|$|A {{nicotine}} <b>lozenge</b> is {{a tablet}} (usually flavored) {{that contains a}} dose of nicotine which dissolves slowly in the mouth to release the nicotine.

5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat <b>lozenges.</b> They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S.

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila GATA factor Serpent {{interacts with}} the RUNX factor <b>Lozenge</b> to {{activate}} the crystal cell program, whereas SerpentNC binds the Friend of GATA protein U-shaped to limit crystal cell production. Here, we identified a <b>lozenge</b> minimal hematopoietic cis-regulatory module and showed that lozenge–lacZ reporter-gene expression was autoregulated by Serpent and <b>Lozenge.</b> We also showed that upregulation of u-shaped was delayed until after <b>lozenge</b> activation, consistent with our previous results that showed u-shaped expression in the crystal cell lineage is dependent on both Serpent and <b>Lozenge.</b> Together, these observations describe a feed forward regulatory motif, which controls the temporal expression of u-shaped. Finally, we showed that <b>lozenge</b> reporter-gene activity increased in a u-shaped mutant background and that forced expression of SerpentNC with U-shaped blocked lozenge- and u-shaped-lacZ reporter-gene activity. This is the first demonstration of GATA:FOG regulation of Runx and Fog gene expression. Moreover, these results identify components of a Serpent cross-regulatory sub-circuit that can modulate <b>lozenge</b> expression. Based on the sub-circuit design and the combinatorial control of crystal cell production, we present {{a model for the}} specification of a dynamic bi-potential regulatory state that contributes to the selection between a Lozenge-positive and Lozenge-negative state...|$|R

25|$|Fentanyl <b>lozenges</b> (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation}} of fentanyl citrate {{on a stick}} {{in the form of}} a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These <b>lozenges</b> are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a stick swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).|$|E

Participants: The single-blinded, randomized, controlled study involved 110 adult patients undergoing diagnostic UGE at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark. Methods: The patients were randomized to receive either 100 mg lidocaine as a <b>lozenge</b> or 5 mL lidocaine viscous oral solution 2 %. Intravenous midazolam was administered if needed. The effect of a lidocaine <b>lozenge</b> in reducing patient discomfort, including the gag reflex, during UGE compared with a lidocaine oral solution was assessed. Results: Questionnaires from the patients showed that the gag reflex was acceptable for 64 % in the <b>lozenge</b> group compared with 33 % in the oral solution group (P = 0. 0072).

40|$|Background: Randomized {{efficacy}} {{clinical trials}} conducted in research settings may not accurately reflect {{the benefits of}} tobacco dependence treatments when used in real-world clinical settings. Effectiveness trials (eg, in primary care settings) are needed to estimate the benefits of cessation treatments in real-world use. Methods: A total of 1346 primary care patients attending routine appointments were recruited by medical assistants in 12 primary care clinics. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 active pharmacotherapies: 3 monotherapies (nicotine patch, nicotine <b>lozenge,</b> and bupropion hydrochloride sustained release [SR]) and 2 combination therapies (patch + <b>lozenge</b> and bupropion SR + <b>lozenge).</b> Patients were referred to a telephone quit line for cessation counseling. Primary outcomes included 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 1 week, 8 weeks, and 6 months after quitting and number of days to relapse. Results: Among 7128 eligible smokers (10 cigarettes per day) attending routine primary care appointments, 1346 (18. 9 %) were enrolled in the study. Six-month abstinence rates for the 5 active pharmacotherapies were the following: bupropion SR, 16. 8 %; <b>lozenge,</b> 19. 9 %; patch, 17. 7 %; patch + <b>lozenge,</b> 26. 9 %; and bupropion SR + <b>lozenge,</b> 29. 9 %. Bupropion SR + <b>lozenge</b> was superior to all of the monotherapies (odds ratio, 0. 46 - 0. 56); patch + <b>lozenge</b> was superior to patch and bupropion monotherapies (odds ratio, 0. 56 and 0. 54, respectively). Conclusions: One in 5 smokers attending a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt that included evidence-based counseling and medication. In this comparative effectiveness study of 5 tobacco dependence treatments, combination pharmacotherapy significantly increased abstinence compared with monotherapies. Provision of free cessation medications plus quit line counseling arranged in the primary care setting holds promise for assisting large numbers of smokers to quit...|$|R
50|$|The <b>lozenge</b> has {{for many}} centuries been {{particularly}} associated with certain females {{as a vehicle}} for the display of their coats of arms, instead of the escutcheon or shield, which is in its origin an object of manly warfare. In this case the <b>lozenge</b> is without crest or helm, again objects of manly warfare. However, for the practical purpose of categorisation the <b>lozenge</b> may be treated as a variety of heraldic escutcheon. Traditionally very limited categories of females have been able to display their own arms, for example a female monarch (who uses an escutcheon not a <b>lozenge,</b> being unlike most armigerous females, a military commander) and suo jure peeresses, who may display their own arms alone on a <b>lozenge</b> even if married. In general a female was represented by her paternal arms impaled by the arms of her husband on an escutcheon. (See Marshalling (heraldry)). In modern Canadian heraldry, and certain other modern heraldic jurisdictions, women may be granted their own arms and display these on an escutcheon. Life peeresses in England display their arms on a <b>lozenge.</b> An oval or cartouche is occasionally also used instead of the <b>lozenge</b> for armigerous women. As a result of rulings of the English Kings of Arms dated 7 April 1995 and 6 November 1997, married women in England, Northern Ireland and Wales and in other countries recognising the jurisdiction of the College of Arms in London (such as New Zealand) also have the option of using their husband's arms alone, marked with a small <b>lozenge</b> as a difference to show that the arms are displayed for the wife and not the husband, or of using their own personal arms alone, marked with a small shield as a brisure for the same reason. Divorced women may theoretically until remarriage use their ex-husband's arms differenced with a mascle.|$|R
