25|$|Proof: <b>Let</b> <b>S</b> be a set, and let T be {{the union}} of the {{elements}} of S. Then every element of S is a subset of T, and hence is of cardinality {{less than or equal to}} the cardinality of T. Cantor's theorem then implies that every element of S is of cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of 2T.|$|E

Then f and g are charts, they are compatible, and { f,g } is an atlas for S, making S into a Riemann surface.

Check that S has a vertex cover consisting of one vertex or two non-adjacent vertices.

25|$|A family F of graphs {{is said to}} {{be closed}} under the {{operation}} of taking minors if every minor of a graph in F also belongs to F. If F is a minor-closed family, then <b>let</b> <b>S</b> be the set of graphs that are not in F (the complement of F). According to the Robertson–Seymour theorem, there exists a finite set H of minimal elements in S. These minimal elements form a forbidden graph characterization of F: the graphs in F are exactly the graphs that do not have any graph in H as a minor. The members of H are called the excluded minors (or forbidden minors, or minor-minimal obstructions) for the family F.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of forbidden minor characterizations for all minor-closed graph families is an equivalent way of stating the Robertson–Seymour theorem. For, suppose that every minor-closed family F has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors, and <b>let</b> <b>S</b> be any infinite set of graphs. Define F from S {{as the family}} of graphs {{that do not have}} a minor in S. Then F is minor-closed and has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors. Let C be the complement of F. S is a subset of C since S and F are disjoint, and H are the minimal graphs in C. Consider a graph G in H. G cannot have a proper minor in S since G is minimal in C. At the same time, G must have a minor in S, since otherwise G would be an element in F. Therefore, G is an element in S, i.e., H is a subset of S, and all other graphs in S have a minor among the graphs in H, so H is the finite set of minimal elements of S.|$|E
