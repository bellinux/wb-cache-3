Some researchers have discussed deeper impressions, which do not appear on the surface <b>of</b> <b>impressions</b> explicitly expressed by users. In this study, we advance the discussion on this kind <b>of</b> deeper <b>impression,</b> which we called the “Heart <b>of</b> <b>Impressions.</b> ” Concretely, we first discuss “where in people’s mind can we capture the Heart <b>of</b> <b>Impressions?</b> ” Next, we discuss “How can we capture the impressions? ” under our hypothesis that “Heart <b>of</b> <b>Impressions</b> exists {{in the center of the}} structure, which involves not only the surface impressions but also the latent impressions. ” Then, we show a method for approaching Heart <b>of</b> <b>Impressions</b> by focusing on structure and the semantic network. 1...|$|R

It provides a complete mathematical apparatus for Impression Evaluation Method in dealing with products, services or activities in order to construct the so called “black box” <b>of</b> the <b>impression</b> formation process. The proposed algorithm is based on the conceptual definition <b>of</b> <b>impression,</b> conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> formation process and the concept <b>of</b> <b>Impression</b> Evaluation Method developed in the authors’ previous works. The developed algorithm contains well established and time-tested functions and statements from different areas. Some novel functions related to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Impression</b> Evaluation Method are developed. The classical desirability function is modified in order to eliminate some shortages related to its usage in the current context. The constructed algorithm is presented in the object-oriented style in order to facilitate to the degree possible its translation into the programming languages.

In this study investigation {{was done on}} the size <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> material used to elucidate the possibilities role <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> material in gaining dimensional changes <b>of</b> <b>impression.</b> Rectangle shape alginate impressions were made in 29. 57 mm length, 19. 45 mm width and 9. 67 mm thickness mold of metal master die covered by glass plate and dimensional changes are measured on alginate impression itself. Then data were analyzed with T-test (paired samples test) to compare dimension changing between alginat height and dimension changing on length and width. Measured results show the dimensional changes occur 3. 16 % ± 0. 63 % on length side, 3. 35 % ± 0. 42 % on width side and 10. 87 % ± 1. 01 % on thickness side, respectively.

40|$|In contextual advertising, {{estimating}} the number <b>of</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> an ad {{is critical in}} planning and budgeting advertising campaigns. However, producing this forecast, even within large margins of error, is quite challenging. We attack this problem by simulating {{the presence of a}} given ad with its associated bid over historical data, involving billions <b>of</b> <b>impressions.</b> This apparently enormous computational task is reduced to a search task involving only the set of distinct pages in the data. Furthermore the search is made more efficient using a two-level search process. Experimental results show that our approach can accurately forecast the expected number <b>of</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> contextual ads in real time...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{expressive}} auction {{design that}} allows advertisers {{to specify the}} kinds of demographics and websites they wish to target within an advertising network. The design allows the network to differentiate impressions according to relevant attributes (e. g., geographic <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the user, topic of the webpage). Advertisers can place bids for different kinds <b>of</b> <b>impressions</b> according to their attributes, and can also specify volume constraints to control exposure. The novelty of the design is a bidding language that admits scalable allocation and pricing algorithms. We discuss the incentive properties of different pricing approaches. We also propose a bidder feedback mechanism to mitigate the complexity of expressive bidding...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> trays for the closed-mouth impression technique, using two different types <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> material. For this study, five different types <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> trays were used with two different types <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> materials, one <b>of</b> addition silicone and the other of polyether. We designed a model used for taking the impressions and for measuring interocclusal distortion. The results obtained show that the impression trays COE (GC (R) GC America INC. Alsip) and Premier (Premier (R), Premier Dental Products Co. Canada) show a lesser degree of interocclusal distortion when taking closed-mouth <b>impressions.</b> In terms <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> materials, the polyether was the one that produced the best results. From a clinical point of view, our study shows that the use of these types of trays is absolutely recommendable when used according to the clinical indications for which they have been designed; that said, we must not fail to consider that selecting the proper type of tray is also important. 1. 071 JCR (2010) Q 3, 52 / 77 Dentistry, oral surgery & medicin...|$|R

50|$|In social psychology, the {{continuum}} model <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> formation {{was created by}} Fiske and Neuberg (1990). According to this model <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> formation, impressions are formed when individuals automatically categorize others into social categories. Upon categorization, individuals' responses to others are usually based on the activated emotions, cognitions, and behaviors that they associate with that social category. However, with sufficient motivation and resources, individuals can choose to ignore their stereotypes, {{get to know the}} person, and judge them based on learned individuating factors.|$|R

Hence, truth is a term of universal application, but imitation is limited to that narrow field of art which takes cognizance only of material things.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to {{identify}} current trends in impression management on the basis of sociological research and develop recommendations to managers, employees of personnel management services, social workers on peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management. The relevance of the article is in studying the strengthening desire of people to influence each other. Among the objectives of the influence the most common one is the desire to create a good impression on others. This point was chosen by 91 % of the respondents. However, the use <b>of</b> various <b>impression</b> management techniques is ambiguous in its consequences, and, therefore, can constitute significant risks for effective management and interpersonal interaction. At the present stage the conducted studies are mainly related to considering peculiarities <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management techniques in narrow scientific and applied fields. The article proves the wide prevalence of the use <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management techniques in the business sphere and informal environment, their high effectiveness and negative consequences of their application.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss about the {{development}} of an instrument to measure impression management. Impression management involves attempts to establish the meaning or purpose of social interactions, guides actions and helps us anticipate what to expect from others. Although interest in the area <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management continues to grow, the lack of a measure that is both grounded in theory and well-suited for organizational use has slowed the progress in this area. The paper is based on a quantitative approach. The data were collected through a survey among 759 respondents. It offers to understand characteristics <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management in the areas of disaster management in Malaysian organizations. We found four stable dimensions which measure impression management among flood victim in Malaysian contexts. Moreover, scores on the scale developed to measure the impression management criteria yielded excellent validity and reliability estimates. This study provided and presented insights and further understanding <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management from the indigenous perspective, which allows practitioners to gain in-depth knowledge about the implementation <b>of</b> <b>impression</b> management in an organization.
