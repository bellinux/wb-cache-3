50|$|Quite a {{few players}} in this process are conserved across all the plants studied. Sometimes though, despite genetic conservation, the {{mechanism}} of action {{turns out to be}} different. For example, rice is a short-day plant, while Arabidopsis thaliana is a <b>long-day</b> <b>plant.</b> Now, in both plants, the proteins CO and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are present. But, in Arabidopsis thaliana, CO enhances FT production, while in rice, the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E
5000|$|Phytochrome {{comes in}} two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) {{converts}} phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers {{the plant to}} grow. In turn, far-red light {{is present in the}} shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day. [...] Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr. This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering. Other experiments have proven this by exposing plants to extra red-light {{in the middle of the}} night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a <b>long-day</b> <b>plant</b> can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.|$|E
50|$|Florigen {{was first}} {{described}} by Soviet Armenian plant physiologist Mikhail Chailakhyan, who in 1937 demonstrated that floral induction {{can be transmitted}} through a graft from an induced plant to one {{that has not been}} induced to flower. Anton Lang showed that several <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> and biennials could be made to flower by treatment with gibberellin, when grown under a non-flower-inducing (or non-inducing) photoperiod. This led to the suggestion that florigen may be made up of two classes of flowering hormones: Gibberellins and Anthesins. It was later postulated that during non-inducing photoperiods, <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> produce anthesin, but no gibberellin while short-day plants produce gibberellin but no anthesin. However, these findings did not account for the fact that short-day plants grown under non-inducing conditions (thus producing gibberellin) will not cause flowering of grafted <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> that are also under noninductive conditions (thus producing anthesin).|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard {{published}} their discoveries on photoperiodism {{and felt}} it was the length of daylight that was critical, but it was later discovered that {{the length of the}} night was the controlling factor. Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> or short-day plants even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a [...] "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days. [...] Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.|$|R

40|$|Flower {{formation}} in the dayneutral tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cultivar “Trapezond” was accelerated by graft union with the short-day tobacco “Maryland Mammoth” when the grafts were kept on short days and by graft union with the <b>long-day</b> <b>plant</b> N. silvestris L. when they were kept on long days. When Maryland Mammoth/Trapezond grafts were kept on long days, flower {{formation in}} Trapezond was not, or only slightly, delayed compared to Trapezond/Trapezond controls; but when N. silvestris/Trapezond grafts were kept on short days, flower formation in Trapezond was inhibited and its growth changed to dwarf-like habit. The former results indicate transmission of flower-promoting material(s) (“florigen”) from photoperiodic plants maintained under flower-promoting daylength conditions to a dayneutral graft partner; the latter indicate the presence in the <b>long-day</b> <b>plant</b> N. silvestris under short-day conditions of potent flower-inhibiting and growth-regulating material(s) that can also be transmitted to a day-neutral partner.

The honeydew extracts are inactive on Xanthium but do give some flower induction with the short-day plant Lemna perpusilla Torr., strain 6746. The flower-inducing activity is clearly of plant origin and is present in the phloem since the same active material can be obtained from vegetative or flowering Xanthium by methanol extraction, and honeydew produced by aphids feeding on a chemically defined synthetic diet is completely without flower-inducing activity.

40|$|Since {{temperature}} {{is an important}} influence in the activity of most metabolic processes, its influence was examined in some <b>long-day</b> <b>plants,</b> Spinacia oleracea, Brassica, Hyoscyamus niger. If during the dark period respiration were the determining factor, flowering response should increase or decrease with temperature. In spinach, flowering response increased with temperature up to 13 °C, in Brassica and Hyoscyamus no such optimum temperature was found. Flowering was, however, promoted in Brassica plants by cold nights {{at the beginning of}} the experiment. So several processes interfere in flowering, one of them may be respiration. In <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> a short photoperiod in the middle of a long night induced flowering. A temperature of 2 °C during this illumination retarded flowering. So the photochemical reaction was closely related to a biochemical one. No relation was found between flowering response and starch hydrolysis during darkness. Sucrose applied to the plant increased flowering response with a day- length of 10 h, while stronger light had no influence. More knowledge of plant biochemistry was required to indicate which processes were involved. <p/...|$|R
50|$|<b>Long-day</b> <b>plants</b> flower {{when the}} night length falls below their {{critical}} photoperiod.

The use of quantitative data about the response of phonological development to temperature and photoperiod in faba bean is limited. This study was undertaken to examine phonological development of four faba bean cultivars (�Barekat�, �Saraziri�, �Eraghi�, �Gavi�) under 11 sowing dates. The experiment was conducted in Gorgan during 2005 - 2006. Various response functions were evaluated for unctions, cardinal temperatures (base, optimum, and ceiling) for flowering and ceiling photoperiod (the photoperiod below which flowering rate begins to decrease), and photoperiod sensitivity coefficient (slope of the function in response to photoperiod) for flowering rate were determined. �Barekat�, �Saraziri�, and �Eraghi� cultivars showed a qualitative <b>long-day</b> <b>plant</b> (LDP) response to photoperiod, and progress toward flowering stopped when photoperiod decreased about 10 h per day.

40|$|The genus Nicotiana {{contains}} {{species and}} varieties that respond differently to photoperiod for flowering time control as day-neutral, short-day and <b>long-day</b> <b>plants.</b> In classical photoperiodism studies, these varieties {{have been widely}} used to analyse the physiological nature for floral induction by day length. Since key regulators for flowering time control by day length have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by molecular genetic studies, it was intriguing to analyse how closely related plants in the Nicotiana genus with opposite photoperiodic requirements respond to certain flowering time regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC 1) and FRUITFULL (FUL) are two MADS box genes that are involved in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. SOC 1 is a central flowering time pathway integrator, whereas the exact role of FUL for floral induction has not been established yet.

40|$|Many {{plant species}} are {{sensitive}} {{to changes in the}} seasons, especially with regard to their reproductive behaviour. Sexual or vegetative reproductive structures are often only formed at times of the year when days are sufficiently long, or short.

The sensitivity of reproductive processes to photoperiodic control is directly altered by photoreceptor action, particularly in the case of phytochrome B, which has a major influence on whether flowering or tuberization occurs under non-inductive conditions in both long- and short-day plants, but is not involved in daylength measurement.

40|$|This {{study is}} about how changed light {{conditions}} induce dormancy in plants. It is divided in two parts. First a literature study where quantification of light, the concept dormancy, photoperiod and light quality are discussed. Second an experimental part, where the importance of light for sprouting capacity in root buds of perennial sow thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) is investigated. In the science in how flowering in plants are induced the concepts short day/long day plants and light dominant/dark dominant are well-established. These concepts can also be applied to how light induce dormancy in plants. Plants are divided into short-day <b>plants</b> and <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> depending on if endodormancy is induced when day length is longer than a critical threshold value (<b>long-day</b> <b>plants)</b> or shorter than a critical threshold value (short-day plants). Plants can detect both light quality and photon irradiance. Both decrease in the dusk and can therefore be of importance to denote the day length. For {{the most of the}} plants that has been studied, it has been showed that it is the duration of night length (dark dominant) that is important not the daylight as the classification (short-day/long-day) might trick you to believe. But it also exist plants that the duration of the light is important (light dominant), even then they is less common. Studies in spruce (Picea abies) have showed that light quality might be important for how dormancy is induced. So it is many aspects of lights that theoretically can be of importance for how dormancy is induced in plants. Earlier studies have shown that perennial sow thistle has a dormancy stage in autumn. This reduces the sprouting capacity after fragmentation and makes the plant less vulnerable to mechanical control at autumn. In the experimental part perennial sow thistle was exposed to three treatments: (i) long-day with low intensity (18 / 6 light/dark, photon irradiance 324 μmol/m 2 s), (ii) short-day with low intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, photon irradiance 324 μmol/m 2 s) and (iii) short-day with high intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, photon irradiance 485 μmol/m 2 s). Sprouting capacity was evaluated based on proportion of sprouting buds from short fragments. Neither of the daylength treatments used here had any significant effect on sprouting capacity. Sprouting capacity was higher when the irradiance was low. This was not expected and is probably not the cause of dormancy induction in perennial sow thistle...|$|R

40|$|Isoprene is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} gas, and is emitted in such large quantities from the biosphere that it substantially affects the oxidizing potential of the atmosphere. Relatively {{little is known about}} the control of isoprene emission at the molecular level. Using transgenic tobacco lines harbouring a poplar isoprene synthase gene, we examined control of isoprene emission. Isoprene synthase required chloroplastic localization for catalytic activity, and isoprene was produced via the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway from recently assimilated carbon. Emission patterns in transgenic tobacco plants were remarkably similar to naturally emitting plants under a wide variety of conditions. Emissions correlated with photosynthetic rates in developing and mature leaves, and with the amount of isoprene synthase protein in mature leaves.

40|$|Photoperiodic {{flowering}} {{has been}} extensively studied in the annual short-day and <b>long-day</b> <b>plants</b> rice and Arabidopsis while less {{is known about the}} control of flowering in perennials. In the perennial wild strawberry, Fragaria vesca L. (Rosaceae), short-day and perpetual flowering long-day accessions occur. Genetic analyses showed that differences in their flowering responses are caused by a single gene, the SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS which may encode the F. vesca homolog of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FvTFL 1). We show through high-resolution mapping and transgenic approaches that FvTFL 1 is the basis of this change in flowering behavior and demonstrate that FvTFL 1 acts as a photoperiodically regulated repressor. In short-day F. vesca, long photoperiods activate FvTFL 1 mRNA expression and short days suppress it, promoting flower induction. These seasonal cycles in FvTFL 1 mRNA level confer seasonal cycling of vegetative and reproductive development. Mutations in FvTFL 1 prevent LD suppression of flowering, and the early flowering that then occurs under LD is dependent on the F. vesca homolog of FLOWERING LOCUS T. This photoperiodic response mechanism differs from those described in model annual plants. We suggest that this mechanism controls flowering within the perennial growth cycle in F. vesca, and demonstrate that a change in a single gene reverses the photoperiodic requirements for flowering...|$|R
