Metadata {{is part of the}} fabric of social computing, which includes the use of wikis, blogs, and tagging for collaboration and participation. Metadata also underlies the development of semantic applications, and the Semantic Web — the representation and integration of multimedia knowledge structures on the basis of semantic models. These two trends flow together in applications such as Wikipedia, where authors collectively create structured information that can be extracted and used to enhance access to and use of information sources. Recent discussion has focused on how existing bibliographic standards can be expressed as Semantic Web vocabularies to facilitate the ingration of library and cultural heritage data with other types of data. Harnessing the efforts of content providers and end-users to <b>link,</b> <b>tag,</b> edit, and describe their information in interoperable ways (”participatory metadata”) is a key step towards providing knowledge environments that are scalable, self-correcting, and evolvable.

40|$|Typical {{tasks of}} {{learning}} groups and knowledge workers include working both with printed and digital documents. We present a pen-based and tangible interaction concept for the <b>linking</b> and <b>tagging</b> of documents in a mixed physical and digital environment. The interaction with printed and electronic documents is unified. We therefore use digital pens, which equally capture physical handwriting on real paper {{and act as}} an input device on a specific screen prototype. <b>Links</b> and <b>tags</b> can have variable scopes ranging from small document passages to a collection of several documents. Physical folders along with camera-based marker tracking provide for the tangible definition of document collections. Tags are intuitively defined on a paper tag menu card. We present two visualizations of <b>links</b> and <b>tags</b> (a document-centered viewer and a hyperstructure-centered graph view). These are closely coupled with the physical environment. 1...|$|R
