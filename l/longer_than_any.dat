5|$|By {{the time}} of John Moncure Robinson's {{retirement}} {{as president of the}} company in 1893, the Old Bay Line had upgraded its fleet with propeller-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as electric lighting and staterooms with private baths. The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26years (1867–1893), <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other person in the company's history.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Epsilon {{strengthened}} {{further to}} tie for the second-strongest December hurricane on record with 85mph winds at its peak, and it lasted <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other hurricane ever {{to form in}} December. However, it was eventually torn apart by shear and absorbed into an approaching front. It never made landfall or threatened land. The development and persistence of Epsilon perplexed forecasters at the National Hurricane Center throughout the lifetime of the storm.|$|E

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (<b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for}} the most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins and ties. He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E

5|$|His {{life and}} with it his reign, which were <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other British monarch before him, were marked {{by a series of}} {{military}} conflicts involving his kingdoms, {{much of the rest of}} Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E
5|$|The {{eldest son}} of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward {{was related to}} royalty {{throughout}} Europe. Before his accession to the throne, he served as heir apparent and held the title of Prince of Wales for <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> of his predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval {{his reputation as a}} playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} albums during the 2000s were Life for Rent by Dido and Back to Bedlam by James Blunt. Released in 2003 and 2004 respectively, each spent ten weeks at number one—Back to Bedlam {{was also the}} biggest-selling album of the decade. Dido and Blunt also topped the chart with one other album each. Irish boy band Westlife reached number one with seven different releases, {{the most of any}} act. British singer Robbie Williams released six number one albums, which spent a total of 23 weeks {{on the top of the}} chart, <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other artist—by 2005, Williams had sold more albums during the 2000s than any other act.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} record label {{during this period}} was Polydor Records—benefitting from strong sales from artists such as Ronan Keating, Scissor Sisters and Take That, Polydor topped the chart with 13 different albums which spent 33 weeks at number one, <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other company. Columbia Records released 17 albums that reached number one, {{the most of any}} label; its artists roster featured Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen. In August 2003, Magic and Medicine by The Coral became the 700th album to top the UK chart—fewer than four years later, Not Too Late by Norah Jones became the 800th album to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is one of}} {{only two}} minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos {{features}} a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of C minor and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E

40|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{has been}} shown to be important in marsupials and, specifically, in Trichosurus vulpecula and Petaurus breviceps. Despite its commonality, little is known about the communication in the ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus peregrines. Therefore, to investigate olfactory communication in the ringtail possum, two experiments were conducted. The odour preference experiment examined the importance of fur, salivary, faecal and urinary odours in ringtail possum olfactory communication. The latency to approach urinary odours was significantly <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> for <b>any</b> other odours. Males sniffed familiar female urine samples for a significantly shorter duration <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other odour samples. Fur samples were manipulated for <b>longer</b> durations <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other odour samples. The discrimination experiment examined the ability of ringtail possums to discriminate between urine samples, and hence obtain socially significant information from such odour sources. The ringtail possums showed that they were able to discriminate between individuals and between sexes. The possible functions of urine, fur and paracloacal gland secretions are discussed...|$|R
