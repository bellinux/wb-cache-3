5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

5|$|Henry Raeburn, {{most famous}} for his {{intimate}} portraits of leading figures in Scottish <b>life,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as {{of one of the}} most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting {{without having to}} lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined {{with the creation of}} the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the film}} was to be {{released}} in 2000, rumoured to be titled Bond 2000. Other rumoured titles included Death Waits for No Man, Fire and Ice, Pressure Point and Dangerously Yours. The title The World Is Not Enough is an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non sufficit, which in real <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> motto of Sir Thomas Bond. In the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service and its film adaptation, this is revealed to be the Bond family motto. The phrase originates from the epitaph of Alexander the Great.|$|E

5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in Abovian's <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Friedrich Parrot in Armenia in September 1829, a {{professor}} of natural philosophy from the University of Dorpat in Livonia (in present-day Tartu, Estonia). Parrot traveled to Armenia to climb Mount Ararat to conduct geological studies and required a local guide and a translator for the expedition. The Catholicos assigned Abovian to these tasks. With Abovian's assistance, Parrot became the first explorer in modern times to reach the summit of Mount Ararat. The project received full approval from the emperor Nicholas I, who provided the expedition with a military escort.|$|E
