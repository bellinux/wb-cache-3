25|$|After {{a seven-year}} hiatus Wales once again played England and {{continued}} to do so annually throughout the 1920s, apart from in 1924. Because of the long hiatus {{a large proportion of}} players competing in the 1921 match were earning their first cap for the team. The first game at Leeds saw Wales lose 35–9 in front of 13,000. A further 13,000 saw the 1921–22 Kangaroo touring side play Wales in December 1921, this time in Pontypridd. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> these nations played each other, Australia narrowly defeated the Welsh, the final score being 16–21. In 1922 Wales took part in the first international rugby league match to be played in London. England beat Wales 12–7 in Herne Hill but just 3,000 people turned up to watch, one of the lowest attendances to ever watch a Wales match. After four more matches against England in various Rugby League strongholds in Northern England, the Dragons once again played in Wales. Two matches were played in 1926 in Pontypridd, the same year that a Pontypridd domestic side joined the English leagues, although they disbanded a year later. The first match saw finished Wales 22–30 England with a record 23,000 in attendance. The second match saw Wales comfortably beat the touring New Zealand 34–8. Three more matches against England were played including one in November 1928 played in Cardiff. It was in the 1920s that Jim Sullivan, one of three Welsh players to be enrolled into the Rugby League Hall Of Fame, started rising through the ranks at Wigan. A career spanning 25 years saw him play many times for Wales picking up 26 caps, a record that was only beaten in 2010 by Ian Watson. He also represented Great Britain 25 times and Glamorgan & Monmouthshire 12 times.|$|E

Gaga appeared on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast Show on September 9, 2016, alongside host Nick Grimshaw and premiered [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] for the radio. The singer described the release as [...] "overwhelming" [...] and like a [...] "rebirth" [...] while adding {{that she had been}} [...] "in the studio for months and months and now it's in the world [...] It feels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Something about this song, it feels like I'm a new artist." [...] She also sang a few lines of the track.|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> you realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself {{at a place where}} I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the album consists of vintage funk, soul, and jazz samples. Commenting on the album and its use of samples, Pitchfork s Jeff Weiss claims that both Nas and his producers found inspiration for the album's production through the music of their childhood: [...] "The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on [...] "Life's a Bitch". Jazz rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't {{need to make the}} connection explicit—he allowed you to understand what jazz was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> your parents and grandparents heard it." [...] Similarly, journalist Ben Yew comments on the album's nostalgic sounds, [...] "The production, accentuated by infectious organ loop, vocal sample, and synthesizer-like pads in the background, places your mind in a cheerful, reminiscent, mood." ...|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you {{to come out and}} play them your songs <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out [...] "Give the lie to the Devil!" [...] The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight and climbed the hill. When I saw that the Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] But the Franks rallied and charged again <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] but my father rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E
