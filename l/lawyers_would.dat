5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|In July 1866, Willamette University's {{trustees}} {{formed a}} committee to explore {{the possibility of a}} legal department. At that time, legal education was traditionally taught as an apprenticeship in which those wishing to be <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> study under an existing attorney for several years before being allowed to pass the bar. Although the school did not begin a legal department in 1866, Willamette did confer a Doctor of Laws degree on Matthew P. Deady, who later helped establish the University of Oregon School of Law, Oregon’s second law school.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

25|$|The Palatine Police Department {{took the}} two {{suspects}} into custody on May 16, 2002. Luna {{confessed to the}} crime during an interrogation, though his <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> later claim that he was coerced to do so through corporal punishment and threats of deportation. The pair, who met at Palatine's William Fremd High School, subsequently went to trial.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2005, South Korean {{electronics}} giant Samsung {{became the}} club's major sponsor in a two-year deal. This {{would ensure that}} Samsung would have their logo feature {{on the front and}} the back of Victory's home and away kits. Prior to the 2006–07 season, KFC were announced as Victory's sleeve sponsor, with their logo appearing on the sleeve of Victory's home and away kits. On 28 January 2009, Samsung announced {{that they would not be}} renewing their sponsorship for the 2009–10 A-League season. Intralot became the Melbourne Victory's new major sponsor when they signed a two-season $2 million contract on 4 May 2009. Their logo subsequently featured on the front of Melbourne Victory's playing strip, starting from the 2009–10 season. On 6 August 2010, it was announced that law firm Florin Burhala <b>Lawyers</b> <b>would</b> be Melbourne Victory's official shorts sponsor for the 2010–11 season. On 1 June 2011, it was announced that human resources company Adecco Group signed a three-year deal as the club's major sponsor, replacing Intralot. As part of the deal, Adecco's logo will appear on the front of the club's playing strip. Melbourne Victory announced on 16 June 2011 that they had signed a five-year deal with global sportswear giant Adidas as the club's official kit manufacturer.|$|E

500|$|The suits were {{eradicated}} when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL {{to block}} the impending lawsuit, {{on the grounds that}} video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website [...] "I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> do something so stupid, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.

[...] On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled the suit, with Thompson agreeing not to seek any legal restriction on sales of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company, or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games.|$|E
500|$|The two men built a close {{personal}} and professional relationship. [...] Lincoln fell {{into the habit of}} entrusting Seward with tasks not within the remit of the State Department, for example asking him to examine a treaty with the Delaware Indians. [...] Lincoln would come to Seward's house and the two <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> relax before the fire, chatting. Seward began to feature in the president's humorous stories.

500|$|Responding to the unrest, the {{government}} implemented {{state of emergency}} measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC; in March, they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison. Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co-defendants in the Treason Trial; their lawyers could not reach them, {{and so it was}} decided that the <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960. Over the following months, Mandela used his free time to organise an All-In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa became a republic. On 29 March 1961, six years after the Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of [...] "high treason", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed {{the government}}.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{employee}} of the United States Department of State, Mills was Counselor to the Secretary of State; it is unclear under the Federal Rules of Evidence whether attorney–client privilege applies to these communications.

2500|$|William O'Hare, {{a lawyer}} for Erhard, had argued that the videotapes should not be {{reviewed}} by defense attorneys because this would violate {{the privacy of the}} individuals that appear in the video. The judge's ruling specified that only expert witnesses, Cox, and his <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> be able to watch the video. Cox's lawyer Sue Himmelrich stated that the video would potentially be able to assist cult experts in testifying that the Cox campaign's characterization of the est organization as a cult was accurate. [...] "Truth is always an absolute defense (against libel). If the tapes establish that they (est instructors) do things that expert witnesses would consider cult-type behavior, that would help establish our defense," [...] said Himmelrich.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the company}} said as early as May 2008 that the billboards were meant [...] "strictly as social parody", there was much debate over whether American Apparel's <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> unfairly use Allen's {{personal}} life, namely his affair with Soon-Yi Previn as their defense at the trial. Charney claimed that these rumors were outright false and that his speech was protected by the First Amendment. In May 2009, the case was settled by American Apparel's insurance carrier for $5 million, with the insurance company paying {{the bulk of the}} settlement. The settlement was for half of Allen's initial demand. Dov Charney said that if it had been up to him, he would have continued the case and taken it to trial.|$|E
2500|$|In those days, {{action in}} detinue sur trover could not lie against a third party. If a person bailed his {{chattels}} to another, and that bailee wrongfully gave, sold or bailed the chattels {{to a third}} party, the only action was against the original bailee. Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> talk of trover and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the bailment as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the bailor to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party.

He said he would not reimburse the payments received by his wife or children, and, saying that he had [...] "nothing to hide", divulged his property holdings. In addition to promising that his <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> question the competency of the PNF to carry out the investigation, he lambasted a [...] "media lynching" [...] of his campaign.

2500|$|On June 4, Federal Judge Russel Zinn {{ruled the}} {{government}} had violated his constitutional rights and must fly him to Canada before July 7. Justice Zinn stated that Mr. Abdelrazik, [...] "is as much a victim of international terrorism as the innocent persons whose lives have been taken by recent barbaric acts of terrorists". The Globe and Mail stated, [...] "In a toughly worded 107-page ruling, Judge Zinn pilloried the government's claims of trying to help Mr. Abdelrazik, concluded that Canadian anti-terrorism agents were implicated in his imprisonment in Sudan, denounced the UN terrorist blacklist as an affront to justice and basic human rights and slammed Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon for high-handedly ignoring due process of law". [...] In response to public demands by opposition parties that Ottawa should stop fighting the case, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said government <b>lawyers</b> <b>would</b> need time to review the 107-page decision before deciding on a course of action.|$|E

[...] On 21 March, Thompson filed a counter-suit, accusing Take-Two of multiple violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), as well as a continued effort to violate his constitutional rights, beginning in July 2005. He also accused the Entertainment Software Association, Penny Arcade, IGN, GamePolitics.com, GameSpot, GameSpy, Eurogamer, Kotaku, Blank Rome and the US Justice Department of collaborating and conspiring with Take-Two to commit racketeering activities.|$|E
