5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

5|$|<b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> memoir {{covering}} Keith Richards's life, {{starting with}} {{his childhood in}} Dartford, Kent, through to his success with the Rolling Stones and his current life in Connecticut.

In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music.
