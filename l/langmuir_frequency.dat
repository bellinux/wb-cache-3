It is expected that a turbulent wake will form behind a spacecraft. Information is to be obtained regarding {{the effect of this}} turbulence on plasma waves measured by the spacecraft. If the turbulence is two-dimensional (2 -D) and carries enstrophy, a fluctuating magnetic field and electric fields are produced. The fields induce fluctuations in the electron population which correlate with the magnetic and electric fluctuations which produced them. This correlation causes diffusion which changes the electron distribution and heats the electrons.

The wake wave-break due to the inhomogeneity of the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>frequency</b> is accompanied by electron injection into the acceleration phase.

The model includes dissipative terms to model collisions and Landau damping of the electrons and ions, and a linear density profile, which models the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10 – 100 km. The injection of energy into the system is modeled by a constant source term in the Zakharov equation. Langmuir turbulence is excited “on-demand” in controlled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by an HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing turbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation recorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the turbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to the turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>frequency</b> equals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a simple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency spectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere.

Since the considered scattering process occurs in a region near the reflection height, it explains why the frequency up-shifted HFPLs should originate from the altitude near the reflection height as observed.

Secondly, a sharp threshold for the global existence and blowup of the solutions was derived by introducing some auxiliary functionals and invariant manifolds and applying potential well argument and the concavity method.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a pulsed, CO 2 laser beam and the plasma produced in a plasma focus device is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The CO 2 laser radiation, directed orthogonal to the pinch axis {{and along the}} density gradient only weakly perturbs the focus since the radiation density of 30 J cm- 3 (allowing for the Airy enhancement factor near the critical layer), is still less than the plasma thermal energy >≈ 1 kJ cm- 3. On the contrary, the CO 2 laser beam is grossly affected by the plasma and absorption during the compressed pinch phase when the plasma frequency ωpe >≈ ωCO 2 is much more complete than can be predicted by classical resistivity. Density fluctuations at the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>frequency</b> are measured directly by forward scattering from a probe, ruby laser beam. Since the wave numbers correspond to (KλD) ~ 0. 1 the Langmuir waves should appear as electron 'lines' in the scattered spectrum shifted by 427 Å from the ruby laser wavelength. At low CO 2 laser pump intensity the electron wave intensity {{is close to the}} thermal level. As the pump is increased beyond a threshold of ~ 3 x 109 W/cm- 2 (in vacuo) enhanced scattering is observed, reaching a factor of 30 above thermal.

30|$|This {{scenario}} leaves unexplained {{the narrow}} {{gap in the}} MFB just below 1.3 – 1.5  MHz depending on location. Electron density profiles measured with the Sondrestrom radar during MFB show the highest density in the E-region (e.g., Figs. 4 c and 4 d in Broughton et al. 2012) consistent with characteristics of other published electron density profiles associated with expanding substorm arcs (e.g., Fig. 1 of Oyama et al. 2014). One idea is that such profiles could have an inflection point in the topside density profile, though the enhanced electron density profile in Fig.  4 c does not show this effect. Such an inflection point in the electron density profile would occur at approximately the same altitude where the <b>Langmuir</b> <b>frequency</b> would match {{the gap in the}} MFB emission. It is not clear how an inflection point would cause an interruption in MFB generation, however. Another possibility is that a trough in electron density above the density maximum could be deep enough to cause the plasma frequency to lie below the gyrofrequency for a short span of altitudes. Neither the modeled density profile of Fig.  4 c nor the measured profiles in Broughton et al. (2012) or Oyama et al. (2014) show this effect, but if it occurred, it would explain the gap in the MFB spectrum since LO-mode emission would not occur from the range of altitudes for which f_ce>f_pe where Langmuir waves connect to the whistler mode as described above. In summary, there is no satisfactory explanation of the cutoff and gap in the MFB spectrum, but the new-found knowledge that the MFB below the gap, like that above it, is left-polarized places a significant constraint on whatever mechanism causes it.|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{structure of the}} synthetic 17 -residue peptide, conantokin-G (con-G), a gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing marine cone snail neuroactive protein, is altered from a random conformation to one containing {{a very high level}} (> 70 %) of alpha-helix on binding of multivalent cations. The proportion of alpha-helix formed correlated well with the size of the cation and ranged from a low of approx. 7 % with large cations, such as Ba 2 +, to more than 70 % with smaller cations, such as Mn 2 +, Mg 2 + and Zn 2 +. The valency of the multivalent cation was not as important, since tervalent lanthanides (Eu 3 +, Gd 3 + and Tb 3 +) of ionic radius 106 - 109 pm induced similar levels (50 - 60 %) of helix to those induced by Ca 2 + and Cd 2 + (ionic radii 109 and 114 pm respectively). Although the correlation was not as tight, smaller cations of the same valency allowed the helical transition to occur at lower concentrations than the larger cations. The spectroscopic and spectrometric properties of some of these cations permitted a more detailed analysis of the molecular nature of the cation-con-G binding. EPR-based titrations with Mn 2 + provided a binding isotherm that was deconvoluted to a single class of 2 - 3 Mn 2 + sites of average Kd 3. 9 microM. This number of sites was similar to that for Ca 2 + [Prorok, Warder, Blandl and Castellino (1996) Biochemistry 35, 16528 - 16534], but a much lower Kd was displayed with Mn 2 +. Determinations by 1 H NMR of the longitudinal relaxation rates of the water protons in Mn 2 +/con-G solutions at different magnetic field strengths corresponding to the proton <b>Langmuir</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 24, 300 and 500 MHz permitted calculation of the hydration number of Mn 2 + in the complex, which was found to be 1. 0. This indicates that five of the six co-ordination sites of Mn 2 + are occupied by peptide atoms, probably oxygens. Titrations of the changes in Tb 3 + fluorescence {{as a result of its}} binding to con-G gave an EC 50 of 58 microM, a value nearly identical with that obtained by titration of the change in helicity of the peptide as a function of Tb 3 + concentration. This shows that the macroscopic binding of Tb 3 + to con-G is directly responsible for the alteration in {{secondary structure}} of the peptide. Finally, Cd 2 + was found to be an extremely suitable cation for an NMR-based investigation of the amino acid residues of apo-con-G that are perturbed by cation binding. In a limited example of the results of this study, it was discovered that originally equivalent CH 2 (delta) protons of Arg 13 became distinctly magnetically non-equivalent in the Cd 2 +-bound helical form of con-G. This indicates that Arg 13 is situated in the helix in such a way that the mobility of its side chain is highly restricted. In conclusion, the data show that a variety of multivalent cations with measurable spectroscopic and spectrometric properties interact similarly with con-G and generate extensive alpha-helical conformation in this peptide...|$|R
