5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the village of}} Etene, {{focusing}} on the protagonist, an orphan <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sister is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's laier. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body {{in a desperate attempt to}} try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Poor living {{conditions}} and poverty {{led to the}} evolution of crime in China. Perhaps the number of children who committed crimes might have been reduced if the standards of living had been higher. Some of these children were <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families in these desperate conditions, but there were also numerous homeless, destitute children living on the streets. Many children were turned out of their home and left to fend for themselves at an early age, and many more ran away because of ill treatment.|$|E
25|$|Among {{victims who}} are still <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> {{perpetrators}} high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. Depression is also common, as victims are made to feel guilty for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and {{it is suggested that}} many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Non-fraternal {{polyandry}} {{occurs when}} the wives' husbands are unrelated, as among the Nayar tribe of India. It happens sparsely among tribes in separate worldwide locations. In this case, a woman undergoes a ritual marriage before puberty, and he is acknowledged {{as the father of}} all her children. She, however, may never cohabit with him, taking multiple lovers instead; these men must acknowledge the paternity of their children (and hence demonstrate that no caste prohibitions have been breached) by paying the midwife. The women remain in their maternal home, <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> brothers, and property is passed matrilineally. A similar form of matrilineal, de facto polyandry {{can be found in the}} institution of walking marriage among the Mosuo tribe of China.|$|E

It is now known as the Cancer Support Community, except in Canada, where local branches retain the original name of Gilda's Club.|$|R
25|$|Some {{authors have}} noted the {{connection}} of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.|$|E
25|$|When Mickey visits {{his sister}} Dawn in France in 2005, he was {{surprised}} to discover that she is <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> biological father, Mike. Mickey is unimpressed with his father's sudden return; he refuses to forgive Mike for his prior neglect, and they fight when Mike makes derogatory comments about Rosie. Mike tries to make excuses for his absence, but Mickey refuses to believe him. They eventually call an uneasy truce, but Mike alienates his son further when he tries to con his friend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) out of his life savings. Mickey enters into a relationship with Li Chong (Elizabeth Tan) in 2007, and they eventually both move into Gus Smith's (Mohammed George) flat. Li often tests the relationship, infuriating Mickey by growing cannabis in their closet, and then involving him in a money-making scam by advertising him as a male escort without his consent. With persuasion, Mickey agrees to do the male escorting, but Li proves too jealous of his flirtations with other women, so their scam soon ends. Li abruptly ends the relationship when Mickey starts getting too serious for her.|$|E
25|$|Clews’ {{was born}} into a reputable New York family that was well-connected in Newport society. His father Henry Clews was a {{well-known}} and wealthy Wall Street investment banker. His mother Lucy Madison Worthington was a relative of US President James Madison and a direct descendent of American Revolutionary War brigadier general Andrew Lewis. One of Clews' aunts was married into the Vanderbilt family and another into the Astor family. Clews’ older sister Dr. Elsie Worthington Clews Parsons became a renowned anthropologist, author and activist, with three university degrees, including a Masters and a Doctorate from Columbia. During the same period of time when his 1-year-older sister was achieving academic success, Clews himself failed at three successive universities {{by the time he was}} 20 years old, having been expelled from Amherst College, dropping out of philosophy at Columbia and then thrown out of the University of Hanover in Germany. Clews then joined the family financial firm under the tutelage of his father, but that business held no long-term future for his artistic sensibilities. Clews was married in 1901 to divorced New York socialite Louise Morris Gebhard but that marriage also ended in divorce. Clews’ second wife Marie had been previously married to a wealthy Newport businessman from a prominent and wealthy family and was herself born into a prominent family. Henry and Marie met at a New York social function and married in 1914, moved to Paris shortly afterwards and then found their home at the medieval French Riviera chateau when <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> young son in Paris during the First World War became too difficult. During their two decades together in residence at the chateau, in addition to the reconstruction and the creation of art, they also hosted elaborate parties for European society and American expatriates. The local villagers were not forgotten by the Clews, who built a fisherman’s beach with harbour and arranged for religious services and other events on the chateau grounds for people in the town. When Henry died in 1937 the funeral procession included virtually the entire village.|$|E

500|$|The Judd School opened as a {{day school}} for local pupils <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> parents, {{between the ages of}} eight and 16.

During his tenure, William Bryant attempted to extend admission to boarders and estimated the costs to be £50 per term (including fees), but the Board of Governors rejected the idea. However, when a lack of public transport made day-to-day travel to the school impractical, boys were permitted to lodge from neighbouring villages and would stay at masters' homes or at hostels approved by the governors. Entry to the school was conditional upon a pupil passing an entrance exam, which would vary according to the age of the boy. However, the foundation document stipulated that every boy had to be able read, write from dictation and perform sums in the [...] "first four simple rules of Arithmetic, with the multiplication table".|$|E
