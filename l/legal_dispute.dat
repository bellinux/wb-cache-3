5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of <b>legal</b> <b>dispute</b> in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing <b>legal</b> <b>dispute</b> with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E

5|$|However, {{soon after}} the six episodes {{comprising}} the third series had been recorded by Above the Title Productions, a minor <b>legal</b> <b>dispute</b> over the online availability of episodes arose between the production company and The Walt Disney Company, which had started production on the Hitchhiker's movie, also in 2003.

5|$|Kepler {{postponed}} {{the move}} to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the <b>legal</b> <b>dispute</b> over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E
