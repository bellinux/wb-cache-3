25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E
25|$|Underwater World and Dolphin Lagoon was an {{oceanarium}} {{located on}} {{the western part of}} Sentosa at Siloso Point. Opened in 1991, the living museum had more than 2,500 marine and fresh-water animals of 250 species from different regions of the world. The oceanarium was underground and included an 83-metre long travelator that moved visitors along a submerged, glass-windowed tunnel from which they could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> array of marine life including a coral reef, stingrays, moray eels, turtles, sharks, and other fishes. In the 'Dive with the Sharks' programme, visitors could scuba dive in the large oceanarium, even if they are not scuba qualified. Underwater World also included a Dolphin Lagoon which is home to some Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphins, also known as the Pink dolphins. For some time the aquarium {{was also one of the}} few places in the world to display captive dugong. The Underwater World Monorail Station of the now-defunct Sentosa Monorail once connected visiting tourists to the western half of the island, but it no longer does as the monorail was discontinued in March 2005. Because of competition from the new aquarium attraction, S.E.A. Aquarium, which is integrated with the transportation and boardwalk, Underwater World closed on 26 June 2016.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the work}} is often thought of as an unflattering and cold <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> ageing pope besieged by cunning and {{opportunistic}} relatives, the reality is more complex and the artist's intention more subtle. It is certainly a very unguarded portrait {{of one of the}} most powerful men of his day, and in stark contrast to Titian's two earlier portraits of Paul, both of which were deferential. It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth [...] "worthy of Shakespeare", in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and Harold Wethey. However, it was one Titian seems to have resolved; while the complexity of the relationships is all on the canvas, it may have been intended as an indicator to Charles that Paul retained his position as the dominant patriarch– old and frail but still a man of vitality, and in control of his squabbling descendants.|$|E
500|$|Seropian founded his own {{studio in}} 2004 called Wideload Games, {{intended}} to be more streamlined than most video game studios. Calling the current method of game development [...] "broken", Wideload began {{with a staff of}} 10, with the plan to outsource the lion's share of development, to stay within budget. Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade-old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future. Seropian turned to the film industry for cues, saying that it helped to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games. The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on. Wideload produced two games, 2005's Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse and 2008's Hail to the Chimp.|$|E

2500|$|In 1682, {{the minutes}} of the Royal Society in London Robert Hooke noted Thomas Digges' 1571 Pantometria, (a book on measurement, {{partially}} based on his father Leonard Digges' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to {{the invention of the}} telescope, describing Leonard as having a fare seeing glass in the mid 1500s based on an idea by Roger Bacon. Thomas described it as [...] "by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places." [...] Comments on the use of proportional or [...] "perspective glass" [...] are also made in the writings of John Dee (1575) and [...] William Bourne (1585). Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens. The idea of an [...] "Elizabethan Telescope" [...] has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian Colin Ronan 1990s explorations concluding this reflecting/refracting telescope was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559. This [...] "backwards" [...] reflecting telescope would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes. The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the time and it could be the [...] "perspective glass" [...] being described was a far simpler idea, originating with Bacon, of using a single lens held in front of the eye to magnify a distant view.|$|E
