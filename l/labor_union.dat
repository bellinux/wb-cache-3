In 1989 he was re-elected {{for a third}} term as judge/executive, receiving over 70percent {{of the vote in}} a three-way Democratic primary and subsequently winning the general election by nearly a three-to-one margin. He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern <b>Labor</b> <b>Union.</b> Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to unionize Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving financial incentives to companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.|$|E

Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern <b>Labor</b> <b>Union</b> rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1800s, there were {{tremendous}} tensions with workers and managers building the railroads in Costa Rica.

5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock. Representatives from the <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and <b>labor</b> <b>union</b> periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E
