5|$|Morrison's album, Roll {{with the}} Punches, is {{scheduled}} for release on 22 September 2017. That July, he and Universal Music Group were sued by former professional wrestler Billy Two Rivers for using his likeness on its cover and promotional material without his permission.

5|$|The {{damage to}} Formby's lungs from the {{accident}} was exacerbated by tuberculosis, {{and he began to}} miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. The jail had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, {{they were unable to}} see each other. Her <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lawyers</b> <b>said</b> {{it might}} be {{difficult}} for them to recover those amounts from Metro-North and the MTA if the cause of the accident turned out to be Rockefeller's lapse at the controls, since there would be far less liability on their part. New York law further limits potential damages in cases like these. Victims' <b>lawyers</b> <b>said</b> their goal was not so much the money but making sure the railroad installed PTC.|$|R

50|$|On December 7, 2010 {{the judge}} in the divorce case invalidated the post-nuptial marital {{property}} agreement ("MPA") that Frank McCourt had claimed provided him with sole ownership of the Dodgers.

5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was {{declared}} a protected area within {{the meaning of}} the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia, and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman {{in the hope that the}} Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee's pro bono <b>lawyer</b> <b>said</b> that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E

The award was given to Jadiel Velesquez, who <b>lawyers</b> <b>said</b> suffered severe brain damage in the alleged beating. Jadiel Velesquez's grandparents sued, accusing the agency of failing to remove the boy from his home after he {{was brought to the}} hospital with unexplained bruises. The grandparents claimed they were inflicted by the boy's father. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>said</b> the boy was returned to his mother's home despite a doctor's finding of abuse. The beating that left him dependent on 24-hour-care happened weeks later. Jadiel's father pleaded guilty to beating his son and is serving a six-year prison term for aggravated assault, <b>lawyers</b> <b>said.</b> The state of NJ plans to appeal the record-setting verdict.|$|R

The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover {{the entrance to the}} New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains nobody knows how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door.
