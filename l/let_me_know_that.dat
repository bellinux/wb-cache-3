My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots.

Well, that <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E

[...] It was on an EP we called Over It that Victory Music had put out to [...] "test" [...] the waters. Since the song was really working at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called me one day and politely <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we were {{making a lot of}} mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to get off of Victory Music.|$|E

Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle. As I sit here, and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men—my gallant Confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended bow, waiting till the time comes.

60|$|As I {{sat here}} {{looking around for}} an idea {{it struck me that}} I was called for two reasons.
