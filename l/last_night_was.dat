500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{good reviews}} from critics. [...] Brian Zoromski, of IGN, stated that [...] "'Business School' was {{an exercise in}} what works best in an Office episode." [...] Zoromski also praised Joss Whedon's directorial debut for the show, stating that [...] "Whedon's direction and sense of humor was both excellently put to use and alluded to in the scenes in which Jim hilariously pretended to become a vampire." [...] Zoromski {{went on to say}} that the acting of John Krasinski and Rashida Jones, who portrays Karen Filippelli, helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode. He gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10. [...] Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, stated that [...] "This show has always been able to turn on a dime and take the comedy to a soul-stirring dramatic climax with just the lightest of touches, and <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> no different." [...] West went on to praise Michael and Pam's scene at the art show as one of these moments.|$|E
500|$|Lieven recounts how {{the rescue}} parties [...] "in their desperation,... were {{reckless}} with their lives" [...] {{in their attempts}} to find survivors; many were injured in small roof collapses, or suffered the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their endeavours saved lives throughout the remainder of the day and into the night, including a group of 18 men found at around 1:00am. They were the last survivors found. A total of 432 miners had died that day—although some bodies were not found until later—and 7 others died later in hospital or at home. A journalist from The Times wrote: [...] "The numbers are truly awful. We talk in awed terms of the decimation of a regiment in a bloody battle, but here a great community engaged in the pursuit of a peaceful vocation is threatened with the loss of at least a quarter of its able bodied manhood". On the surface the townsfolk waited for news; a reporter for The Dundee Courier thought: [...] "the scene at Senghenydd <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> depressing in the extreme. The streets were full of silent throngs of people who moved aimlessly about or stood stolidly at the street corners." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the opening}} {{night of the}} European leg of the tour in Sunderland, England, Angela Upex of the Evening Chronicle awarded the concert 5 stars, stating [...] "from {{beginning}} to end, Beyoncé's Stadium of Light date was an utter triumph dazzling 50,000 loyal North East fans" [...] and added [...] "As a stalwart of Stadium of Light gigs, I've seen them all but <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the most}} mesmerising concerts I've ever witnessed". Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph also awarded the same show 5 stars and opened her positive review with [...] "When it comes to sheer innovation, showmanship and creativity in contemporary pop, Beyoncé has everyone else beaten". Reviewing the first show in London, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the show 5 stars, noting [...] "Her often formidable and fearsome choreography throughout numbers like [...] "Run The World (Girls)", [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "End Of Time" [...] is powerful and mesmerising, but is then offset by the tenderness of [...] "1+1", [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] and [...] "Runnin (Lose It All)". Beyoncé's dynamic ability to be both vigorous and vulnerable can't be matched by her contemporaries. In fact, we'd go as far to say she's effortlessly proven herself to be this generation's Michael Jackson".|$|E

500|$|Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put {{together}} a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing out to you, {{in regard to the}} matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based." [...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember <b>Last</b> <b>Night?</b> <b>was</b> budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!" [...] Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget.|$|E
500|$|Remember <b>Last</b> <b>Night?</b> <b>was</b> {{cleared by}} the PCA on September 24, 1935 and {{following}} previews in October, opened on November 4. Financially {{the film was}} a failure that according to Laemmle lost money for the studio. Critical reception was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a murder mystery to kid all murder mysteries" [...] and [...] "a riot of comedy spots superimposed on a riot of crime detecting". Whale, the reviewer found, [...] "let himself go in a riotous directorial splurge". Although less effusive, The New York Times praised the film as [...] "good minor fun" [...] and noted the likeable pairing of Young and Cummings. Ed Brophy, Edward Arnold and Arthur Treacher were also singled out for praise. However, the Times concluded that Remember Last Night? should be enjoyed [...] "in moderation" [...] as the [...] "halfwit behavior of the roisterers in the film" [...] may make the viewer come away [...] "with the feeling that one or two additional murders among the madcap principals would have made Long Island a still better place to live in". Variety was strongly disapproving of the film. [...] "The women are more blotto than the men, {{and two of the}} wives are on the make. It's all faintly unwholesome." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. [...] A young couple who had come to have a drink on La Caravelles <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. [...] The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{initially}} {{hoped that the}} line would only be closed {{for a short time}} but further storms prevented work to repair the railway. On the morning of 5 February the hole exposed railway track were reassessed. Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a Cobra meeting and announced an extra £100m for flood works over the year while insisting that everything possible was being done to get [...] "stricken" [...] communities moving again. The Department for Transport said the [...] "most pressing issue" [...] was to get the line up and running as soon as possible, [...] "but equally it is clear it is important we look at the long term as well". Powerful waves caused further damage to the track, sea wall and Dawlish station on 6 February. Adrian Sanders, the MP for Torbay, said the loss of the main line was [...] "a disaster" [...] and called on the Transport Secretary to intervene. John Clatworthy, Devon county councillor for Dawlish, speaking on 10 February said that [...] "The storm <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> unbelievable.

2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Brown affirmed the Supreme Court of Delaware's {{order to allow}} black students to enrolled in previously all-white schools. This was the only case the Supreme Court affirmed in part. The Supreme Court then reversed the Delaware Supreme Court on the constitutional issues, and remanded the cases for further proceedings. After the ruling, a sea change occurred in American and Delaware politics and society. [...] In Delaware, most were {{willing to accept the}} Supreme Court's mandate, but some holdouts were {{to be found in the}} southern portion of the state. [...] The state Department of Public Instruction agreed to integrate all Delaware schools in light of the Supreme Court's order. [...] However, on September 27, 1954, as African-American students were preparing to enroll at the previously all-white Milford High School in Milford, Delaware, unrest from angry townspeople was feared to be imminent. [...] In response, Louis Redding issued an urgent telegram to Delaware Governor J.

2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
