40|$|The spatial {{evolution}} of three-dimensional disturbances in an attachment-line boundary layer {{is computed by}} direct numerical simulation of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Disturbances are introduced into the boundary layer by harmonic sources that involve unsteady suction and blowing through the wall. Various harmonic- source generators are implemented {{on or near the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>line,</b> and the disturbance evolutions are compared. Previous two-dimensional simulation results and nonparallel theory are compared with the present results. The three-dimensional simulation results for disturbances with quasi-two-dimensional features indicate growth rates of only a few percent larger than pure two-dimensional results; however, the results are close enough to enable the use of the more computationally efficient, two-dimensional approach. However, true three-dimensional disturbances are more likely in practice and are more stable than two-dimensional disturbances. Disturbances generated off (but near) the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> spread both away from and toward the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> as they evolve. The evolution pattern is comparable to wave packets in at-plate boundary-layer flows. Suction stabilizes the quasi-two-dimensional attachment-line instabilities, and blowing destabilizes these instabilities; these results qualitatively agree with the theory. Furthermore, suction stabilizes the disturbances that develop off the <b>attachment</b> <b>line.</b> Clearly, disturbances that are generated near the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> can supply energy to attachment-line instabilities, but suction can be used to stabilize these instabilities...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by the need for low-order aerodynamic models to predict accurately the effect on profile drag of controlling <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> transition. Head's entrainment method (1), a rapid integral boundary layer technique used for design studies on swept wings, suffers from the governing swept-tapered turbulent integral boundary layer equations being ill-posed {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>attachment</b> <b>line.</b> This singularity has been treated using crude extrapolations of the attachment-line similarity solution for over half a century, but this approach is unlikely to deliver accurate predictions of the effect of changes in the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> flow on profile drag. An experimental study has been carried out to explore the nature of the turbulent flow in the vicinity of a highly swept swept <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> and has revealed a quite complex, non-monotonic development of the momentum thickness in this region. It has also revealed lower levels of twist in the boundary layer velocity profiles than anticipated from the highly curved character of the inviscid flow streamlines.

ABSTRACT: Procedural Law represents an important tool of application of material law, since it is by the means of procedural law that the litigants presents their claims to the judges aiming at the defense of their rights. Considering that it is during the execution of the sentence, when it is transformed into the benefit of the creditor, the sluggishness and inefficiencies of this phase hinders the enforcement of the sentence and makes it difficult to enforce the collection of debt and contracts, urging uncertainty in the economy.

In this scenario, this paper seeks to analyze how the introduction of this tool by Law nº 11. 387, can confer greater efficiency to the procedural process, which results in positive effects to the administration of the judicial system and the economy as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a 76 degree swept cylinder to establish {{the behavior of the}} <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> transition process in a low-disturbance level, Mach number 1. 6 flow. For a near adiabatic wall condition, the attachment-line boundary layer remained laminar up to the highest attainable Reynolds number. The attachment-line boundary layer transition under the influence of trip wires depended on wind tunnel disturbance level, and a transition onset condition for this flow is established. Internal heating raised the surface temperature of the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> to induce boundary layer instabilities.

It expands into a large region transmitting a compression wave at acoustic speed and spreads as an acoustic wave over the adjacent dryer plate. The initial acoustic pressure force on the dryer is expected to spread from an origin at the steam <b>line</b> <b>attachment.</b> It reflects back toward the RPV wall and again to the dryer until it dissipates.

The critical distance {{is defined as the}} distance from the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> {{to the beginning of the}} zone where roughness elements develop into glaze ice feathers. Icing runs were performed on a NACA 00 1 2 swept wing tip at velocities of 75, 100, 150, and 200 miles per hour. At each velocity and tunnel condition, the sweep angle was changed from 0 deg to 45 deg at 5 deg increments. Casting data, ice shape tracings, and close-up photographic data were obtained. The results showed that at given velocity and tunnel conditions, as the sweep angle is increased from 0 deg to 25 deg the critical distance slowly decreases. As the sweep angle is increased past 25 deg, the critical distance starts decreasing more rapidly. For 75 and 100 mph it reaches a value of 0 millimeters at 35 deg. For 150 and 200 mph it reaches a value of 0 millimeters at 40 deg. On the ice accretion, as the sweep angle is increased from 0 deg to 25 deg, the extent of the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> zone slowly decreases. In the glaze ice feathers zone, the angle that the preferred direction of growth of the feathers makes with respect to the <b>attachment</b> <b>line</b> direction increases.
