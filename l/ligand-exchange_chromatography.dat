The methanol content and copper(II) ion concentration in the eluent affected retentivity and enantioselectivity.

40|$|Chiral <b>ligand-exchange</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> {{is used to}} {{identify}} and quantitate lactic acid enantiomers in wines that have or have not undergone malolactic fermentation. The stationary phase is (R) -penicillamine, which is bound lipophilically to a C 18 bonded silica matrix. The mobile phase is 1 mM copper sulfate, and the detection mode is ultraviolet. Serious interference from (S) -aspartic acid and other amino acids is eliminated {{by the use of}} propanesulfonic acid-type cation exchange solid-phase extraction cartridges prior to chromatographic analysis. Lactic acid enantiomers in wine are quantitated in the range of 10 to 500 mg/L. The detection limit is 3 mg/L. The method is also successful in the determination of lactic acid enantiomers in certain beers (e. g., lambic beers), kim-chi, sauerkraut, and various yogurts...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of Spi(tau-dec), {{derived from the}} selective alkylation of L-spinacine (4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydro- 1 H-imidazo[4, 5 -c]pyridine- 6 -carboxylic acid) at the tau-nitrogen of its heteroaromatic ring, with a linear hydrocarbon chain of 10 carbon atoms, is described {{here for the first}} time. Spi(tau-dec) was successfully employed in the past to prepare home-made chiral columns for chiral <b>ligand-exchange</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography.</b> In the present article a new method is described, using Spi(tau-dec) as a chiral selector in high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) : commercial hydrophobic plates were first coated with Spi(tau-dec) and then treated with copper sulfate. The performance of this new chiral stationary phase was tested against racemic mixtures of aromatic amino acids, after appropriate optimization of both the conditions of preparation of the plates and the mobile phase composition. The enantioselectivity values obtained for the studied compounds were higher than those reported in the literature for similar systems. The method employed here for the preparation of chiral HPTLC plates proved practical, efficient, and inexpensive...|$|R
40|$|D-Penicillamine is {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time as a chiral ligand for the enantioseparation of dansyl amino acids based on <b>ligand-exchange</b> micellar electrokinetic <b>chromatography</b> (LE-MEKC). Copper(II) was used as the central ion in the ternary complex. The effect of surfactant on the resolution was significant. A concentration of 20 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was shown to be necessary for the separation. Other important parameters, such as the concentration ratio of D-penicillamine (D-PEN) to Cu 2 +, the kind of metal central ion, the type and pH value of buffer, were also investigated. N-Acetyl-D-penicillamine and L-valine (Val), with similar structure to D-penicillamine, were applied as their copper(II) complexes as chiral selector and the chiral recognition mechanism is briefly discussed. Under optimum experimental conditions, i. e., 20 mm NH 4 OAc, pH 6. 5, a 2 : 1 concentration ratio Of D-penicillamine to Cu(II), 4 mm CuSO 4 and 8 MM D-penicillamine, the chiral separation of eight pairs of different dansyl amino acid enantiomers was accomplished with resolution ranging from 1. 1 to 5. 9. When L-PEN was used instead Of D-PEN, reversal of the migration order was observed...|$|R

The type of amino acid that is favorable for this class of CSP is discussed. Using the CSP with the phenylalanine peptide selector, the effect of peptide length on the enantioselectivity was investigated in normal-phase mode. The applicability of the CSP with a phenylalanine peptide to chiral <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> was also examined...|$|E

40|$|Systems for on-line {{monitoring}} of bioprocesses were developed, {{consisting of a}} membrane-based sampling unit, a liquid chromatographic (LC) separation step, and a detector. Two sampling units, a tangential flow filtration (TFF) module and a microdialysis probe, were characterised and evaluated for use in different types of bioprocesses. When using the TFF module, an additional sample clean-up step based on solid phase extraction (SPE) {{was found to be}} mandatory to protect the chromatographic column. In contrast, the dialysate from the microdialysis probe was less complex and could be directly injected into the LC column, thus omitting the SPE step. Various modes of LC, especially <b>ligand-exchange</b> and anion-exchange <b>chromatography,</b> were utilised for separation of carbohydrates and alcohols in the bioprocess samples. These analytes were then detected by refractive index, electrochemically, or by in-house made enzyme-based amperometric biosensors. The enzymes used in the biosensors were specific for a group of compounds rather than one-substrate specific, and the sensors could therefore be used as selective LC detectors. Data acquisition and presentation of the signals from the detectors were made using chromatographic software. The parts were integrated into several different on-line systems that allowed the unattended {{monitoring of}} both substrates and products during fermentations. Three different bioprocesses were studied: the production of fuel ethanol from lignocellulosic materials (the main focus of this work), the enzymatic hydrolysis of biopolymers, and the production of inositol trisphosphate from phytic acid...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} for several decades that the two enantiomeric forms of a chiral {{compound}} can have very different effects on the human body. For this reason the synthesis or extraction from a natural source of a potential new drug, as well as its marketing, require a careful control of its optical purity. Chromatographic techniques can respond extremely well to this need, both in the analytical and in the preparative field. Among the several methods developed for this purpose, one of the first and of the most effective is the Chiral <b>Ligand-Exchange</b> <b>Chromatography,</b> which is based on the stability difference between the metallic diastereomeric complexes containing {{one or the other of}} the two enantiomers to be separated and a suitable chiral selector. This technique has been effectively used for resolving racemic mixtures of products of biomedical and/or pharmacological interest, such as α- and β-amino acids either proteinogenic or non-proteinogenic, oligopeptides, amino alcohols or beta-blockers. All these substances are linked together by their ability to bind metal ions, the most widely used of which is Cu(II). The chiral selector can be a component of either the mobile or the stationary phase, to which it can be either chemically bonded or dynamically adsorbed. The latter method has several advantages of convenience and, above all, cheapness. The preparation of dynamically-coated chiral stationary phases for <b>Ligand-Exchange</b> <b>Chromatography</b> has produced a large number of applications, the main of which, both in TLC and in HPLC, are reviewed below...|$|E
40|$|Seawater {{samples from}} several depths in the Sargasso Sea and {{equatorial}} Pacific and from surface stations in Biscayne Bay were analyzed for dissolved {{free amino acids}} and dissolved combined amino acids by a <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> technique. Enantiomeric ratios of dissolved total amino acids from Atlantic and Pacific samples were also determined. On {{the basis of these}} ratios, a bacterial source is postulated for the origin of the dissolved n-amino acids in seawater. The possible contributions from chemical raccmization are compared to biological production as a source for these n-amino acids. Because of the importance of dissolved amino acids in the marine food chain, the role of these compounds as excretion products and as nutrient sources is being thoroughly investigated in estuarine and nearshore environments (e. g. Riley an...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of HPLC columns for chiral <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> by dynamic adsorption of a histidine-based chiral selector (N(tau) -n-decyl-L-histidine, LNDH) on commercial reversed-phase, C 18 columns was investigated. The most suitable solvent for column preparation was sought through {{a study of}} the behaviour of LNDH on the reversed-phase column eluting with different methanol-water ratios at varying pH. It is shown that the use of an aqueous solvent instead of pure methanol is advantageous, despite the decrease in LNDH solubility, and that the solvent pH must be controlled. Open and closed-cycle procedures for flowing the selector solution through the column are compared through a study of chromatographic retention, selectivity and efficiency parameters of selected enantiomers. Even though no significant difference in column loading was found between the two procedures, the open cycle method gave rise to more efficient and selective chiral columns...|$|E
40|$|A new packing {{material}} for <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography,</b> L-proline-modified hydrolyzed vinyl acetate-divinylbenzene copolymer microspheres, has been prepared and evaluated. The microspheres, prepared by a one-step swelling and polymerization method, have a narrow bead size (as determined by scanning electron microscopy, SEM), a broad pore-size distribution (by nitrogen adsorption) and, especially, inhomogeneous structural composition (by differential scanning calorimetry). The support, {{which has an}} L-proline content of 0. 35 mmol g(- 1) (nitrogen analysis), provides good enantioselectivity and column efficiency. Twenty-three of the twenty-four common D,L-amino acids tested were resolved on a 250 mm x 4. 6 mm i. d. column and mixtures of up to seven racemic amino acids were easily separated into their enantiomers. Two average pore diameters, volume-average (00 and surface-average (d(s)) pore diameters, are defined. The ratio d(v) /d(s) is used to characterize the broadness of the pore-size distribution. It is shown that the widely used formula d = 4 V(p) /S for cylindrical pores, where V-p is pore volume and S the specific surface area, gives the surface-average pore diameter...|$|E
40|$|Silica based {{monolithic}} HPLC columns {{have received}} much attention in recent years, particularly those modified for reversed-phase separations. However, for ionexchange, silica based monolithic columns have received only limited attention. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this work was the development and characterisation of novel monolithic stationary phases for the rapid separation o f inorganic and organic ions. A 10 cm bare silica monolith has been modified on-column with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) groups and characterised for its selectivity toward alkali, alkaline earth and selected transition metal cations. The applicability of this IDA silica monolithic column for the rapid determination of alkaline earth metals in complex matrices was demonstrated. A second 10 cm bare silica monolith was functionalised with lysine (2, 6 -diaminohexanoic acid) groups, and both the cation- and anion-exchange properties of the lysine functionalised monolith were evaluated, with a separation of 6 UV absorbing anions achieved in less than 100 seconds. By dynamically modifying the surface of the lysine functionalised silica monolith with copper (II) ions, it was possible to separate L-amino acids via <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography,</b> using flow rates up to 7 mL/min. Finally, the ion-exchange properties o f a bare silica monolith were evaluated. The separation of alkaline and transition metal ions on a 10 cm bare silica monolith was possible using acetonitrile or methanol based ammonium and sodium acetate buffered eluents. The effects o f eluent ionic strength, organic content and pH on cation retention were evaluated, and in addition, the effect of solvent polarity on cation selectivity was also investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of d-amino acids (d-AAs) {{as a consequence}} of natural or artificial interventions such as ageing, microorganism action, preservative and conservative processes (alkali or heat treatment), is a scarcely treated aspect from the scientific community. It is also fully documented that even a minor degree of racemisation on the proteins' AAs is the cause of a reduced digestion of such proteins. Besides interfering with the regular metabolism of l-AAs, d-AAs can also {{contribute to the development of}} pathological conditions in humans. So far, nearly all the most important chromatographic techniques were applied to quantify d-AAs in foodstuffs. However, most of them rely upon pre- or post-column derivatization procedures, often combined with sophisticated analytical equipments. Differently, in this paper we propose an easy-to-set up combination of monodimensional chromatographic methods to monitor the variation of the d-Ala, d-Asp and d-Glu content in two commercially available Spanish cheese samples prepared from the same milk mixture and characterized by a different maturity time: no ripening and six months ripening. After the free amino acid mixture was extracted from the two cheese samples, an ion-pairing RP-HPLC achiral protocol was firstly optimized with the objective to avail of a method enabling the complete distinction of Ala, Asp, and Glu from all the other aminoacidic species in the two extracts. An ion-exchange-based chromatographic method was also optimized, thus allowing a profitable fractionation of the two aminoacidic mixtures. With such a procedure, less complex samples to be analyzed with a chiral <b>ligand-exchange</b> <b>chromatography</b> (CLEC) stationary phase based on S-trityl-. l-cysteine (. l-STC) units were obtained. The optimized CLEC conditions were then applied to the previously identified Ala, Asp and Glu containing fractions as well as to those including all the remaining species. For all the three compounds the enantiomeric excess (ee) was found to decrease passing from the ripened to the fresh cheese. As expected, the largest difference was found for Ala (ee value from 83. 0 % down to 20. 5 %), followed progressively by Asp (ee value from 90. 5 to 75. 0 %) and Glu (ee value from 99. 0 to 91. 8 %). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
