500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed {{was one of the most}} bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Of the {{two songs}} from How the Grinch Stole Christmas! {{featured}} in the episode, the first, a voiceover vocal of [...] "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" [...] sung by k.d. lang, based on {{a version of the}} song by artist Aimee Mann, as Sue wreaks havoc on the choir room, confused some reviewers, who thought that it was sung by Lynch herself. Benigno was one of these, though he said it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable", gave the song a [...] "B+", and approved of the change in lyrics from [...] "Mr. Grinch" [...] to [...] "Sue the Grinch". Harper also approved of the change, and admitted she thought Lynch had sung it until Google set her straight. Futterman called the song a [...] "weirdly fitting moment" [...] that [...] "nevertheless fell a bit short of being fully realized". The second song, [...] "Welcome Christmas", was welcomed by reviewers: Benigno described it as [...] "really, really lovely" [...] and gave it an [...] "A". Harper cheered, and noted that the song [...] "was sung very much like a real glee club, without people getting to showboat individually". Futterman characterized it as a [...] "note-perfect performance", and wrote: [...] "The layered harmonies and simple sentiment—'Christmas will always be, just so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> glee!'—tie the episode up with a bow, smoothing out the bumps that came before it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bodies of water, {{fresh and}} saline, have been {{important}} sources of food for people for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> existed. It should be no surprise that ancient villages were located at the water's edge. [...] Since {{the last ice age}} sea level has risen as much as 400 feet (~120 meters).|$|E
60|$|We drove with us six {{or seven}} cows for food; but our negroes knew nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them the way, {{and then they were}} mighty willing to do so <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we found <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were still}} {{business}} fluctuations <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> business, {{but they were}} on a smaller and smaller scale, and with the final lapse of business they necessarily vanished; all economic chance vanished. The founders of the commonwealth understood perfectly that business was the sterile activity of the function interposed between the demand and the supply; that it was nothing structural; and they intended its extinction, and expected it from the moment that money was abolished." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{that fellow}} after that, {{he was always}} hungry; he was always thirsty. He came early; he stayed late; he could not pass a restaurant; he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wine shop. Suggestions to stop, excuses to eat and to drink, were forever on his lips. We tried all we could to fill him so full {{that he would have}} no room to spare for a fortnight, but it was a failure. He did not hold enough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite.|$|R
2500|$|... "While the law recognizes {{and gives}} us the right to ride in such conveyances," [...] the {{editorial}} continued, [...] "there are {{a certain number of}} the employees of this Company, who, if a colored person attempts to cross the street while their car is passing, are seized with a sudden fit of Negrophobia, which is generally manifested by pulling their alarm bell violently, as if some danger was imminent, so afraid are they that some other of our respectable females might attempt to exercise the right that Miss Brown has just won. [...] So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> law, justice and right on our side, we want no pity.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the whites}} in the court room likely resented Leibowitz as a Jew from New York hired by the Communists, and for his {{treatment}} of a southern white woman, even a low-class one, as a hostile witness. Some wondered {{if there was any}} way he could leave Decatur alive. [...] The National Guard Captain Joe Burelson promised Judge Horton that he would protect Leibowitz and the defendants [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a piece of ammunition or a man alive." [...] Once Captain Burelson learned that a group was on their way to [...] "take care of Leibowitz," [...] he raised the drawbridge across the Tennessee River, keeping them out of Decatur.|$|E
2500|$|The C-124 {{departed}} McChord Air Base in Washington state {{en route}} to Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska, with a crew of 11 and 41 Army and Air Force passengers. The flight was recorded as passing Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Around 4pm, a distress call was received by the pilot of a Northwest Orient Airlines passenger aircraft. The reception was very poor, but the Northwest captain made out the sentence: [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to land, {{we might as well}} land here." [...] Weather near Elmendorf at the time was very bad with heavy clouds. The C-124 was flying without visual references, using just altitude, a radio beacon and a stopwatch. There was no further communication from the C-124 and it failed to arrive at Elmendorf as scheduled.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you've {{seen the}} last of our guest," [...] Mr. Fentolin remarked, as Hamel and Gerald re-entered the dining-room. [...] "A queer fellow--almost a new type to me. Dogged and industrious, I should think. He hadn't the least right to travel, you know, and I think so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> taken the trouble to {{telephone}} to Norwich, he might have waited to see the physician. Sarson was very angry about it, but {{what can you do}} with these fellows who are never ill? They scarcely know what physical disability means. Well, Mr. Hamel, and {{how are you going to}} amuse yourself to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At a postern gate, Andrej Kourbsky and {{two hundred}} men met Yediguer and 10,000 Tatars, {{and cut off}} their retreat, {{enclosing}} them in the narrow streets. They forced their Khan to take refuge in a tower, and made signs as if to capitulate. 'Listen,' they said. <b>'As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a government, <b>we</b> were willing to die for our prince and country. Now Kazan is yours, we deliver our Khan to you, alive and unhurt--lead him to the Tzar. For our own part, we are coming down into the open field to drain our last cup of life with you.' ...|$|R
60|$|What little rivulets {{we found}} here were so empty of water, that except some pits, and {{little more than}} {{ordinary}} pools, there was scarcely any water {{to be seen in}} them; and they rather showed that during the rainy months they had a channel, than that they had really running water in them at that time, by which it was easy for us to judge that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a great way to go; but this was no discouragement so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> but provisions, and some seasonable shelter from the violent heat, which indeed I thought was much greater now than when the sun was just over our heads.|$|R
2500|$|Some of Bragg's {{subordinate}} generals {{were frustrated}} {{at what they}} perceived to be his lack of willingness to exploit the victory by pursuing the Union army toward Chattanooga and destroying it. Polk in particular was outraged at being relieved of command. The dissidents, including many of the division and corps commanders, met in secret and prepared a petition to the president. Although {{the author of the}} petition is not known, historians suspect it was Simon Buckner, whose signature was first on the list. Lt. Gen. James Longstreet wrote to the Secretary of War with the prediction that [...] "nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our present commander." [...] With the Army of Tennessee literally on the verge of mutiny, Jefferson Davis reluctantly traveled to Chattanooga to personally assess the situation and to try to stem the tide of dissent in the army. Although Bragg offered to resign to resolve the crisis, Davis eventually decided to leave Bragg in command, denounced the other generals, and termed their complaints [...] "shafts of malice".|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Forester; [...] "not at all. <b>We</b> shall <b>have</b> more in use at one time, it is true, but {{the whole}} bunch may last <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> only one cut at a time." ...|$|R
60|$|The human animal perishes if not fed. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> gone so {{far with}} our happy-go-lucky scheme of {{existence}} {{that it has become}} necessary to remind ourselves of that. So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> money <b>we</b> thought we could continue to exist. Not so. Henceforth till we feed ourselves again, we live on sufferance, and dangle before all eyes the apple of discord. A self-supporting Britain, free from this carking fear, would become once more a liberalising power. A Britain fed from overseas can only be an Imperialistic Junker, armed to the teeth, jealous and doubtful of each move by any foreigner; prizing quantity not quality; indifferent about the condition of his heart. Such a Britain dare not be liberal if it will.|$|R
60|$|He had {{continued}} his altered carriage to me near a month, {{and we began}} to live {{a new kind of}} life with one another; and could I have satisfied myself to have gone on with it, I believe it might <b>have</b> continued <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> continued alive together. One evening, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were sitting and talking very friendly together under a little awning, which served as an arbour at the entrance from our house into the garden, he was in a very pleasant, agreeable humour, and said abundance of kind things to me relating to the pleasure of our present good agreement, and the disorders of our past breach, and what a satisfaction it was to him that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> room to hope <b>we</b> should never <b>have</b> any more of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Same to you, Cap'n," [...] {{she said}} with a laugh; [...] "but as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the purple berries we needn't worry about our size." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he says he'd {{rather not}} come in, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> company. He says he isn't dressed for dinner; left his spike-tail in the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we won't starve as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> berries, birds, and fish," [...] said Earl. [...] "I don't {{see where}} this cry of {{starvation}} comes in, I must say." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{money in}} this place is English, of course, as it is an English colony; {{but there are so}} many {{visitors}} from the United States, that American currency is as much in use, for large sums, as the pounds-shillings-and-pence arrangement. But all sums under a quarter are reckoned in English money,--pennies, half-pennies, four, six and eight-pences, and that sort of thing. One of our quarters passes for a shilling, but a silver dime wont pass in the shops. The darkeys will take them--or almost anything else--as a gift. I didn't have to get our money changed into gold. I got a draft on a Nassau house, and generally drew greenbacks. But I saw, pretty plainly, that I couldn't draw very much for this new monarchical undertaking, and stay in Nassau <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> planned.|$|R
6000|$|Every {{few days}} some melancholy train entered the metropolis, the {{inhabitants}} of some captured town bearing the few effects spared them, and weeping and bewailing the desolation of their homes. When the tidings arrived that Illora and Moclin had fallen, the people were seized with consternation. [...] "The right eye of Granada is extinguished," [...] exclaimed they; [...] "the shield of Granada is broken: what shall protect us from the inroad of the foe?" [...] When {{the survivors of the}} garrisons of those towns arrived, with downcast looks, bearing the marks of battle and destitute of arms and standards, the populace reviled them in their wrath, but they answered, [...] "We fought <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> force to fight or walls to shelter us; but the Christians laid our town and battlements in ruins, and we looked in vain for aid from Granada." ...|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, Osmond {{was once}} heard to say, {{it was a}} pity the boy {{was not to be}} a hostage for life; to which Sir Eric replied, [...] "So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not the {{training}} of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Struck," [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Porter; [...] "and {{the only}} wonder {{to me is}} we’ve stood it so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have.</b> If I was to tell you all we’ve ’ad {{to put up with}} I don’t suppose you’d believe me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do {{not know}} what will happen to us after we leave this {{delightful}} orchard," [...] he said, [...] "so I think it wise to carry a supply of apples with us. We can't starve as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> apples, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|However desperate a {{position}} may seem, unlooked-for loopholes often present themselves, and so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> live and <b>have</b> sound limbs to aid us to seize such opportunities as may offer, it is a weak thing utterly to abandon hope.|$|R
6000|$|Newman {{continued}} {{to see his}} friends the Tristrams with {{a good deal of}} frequency, though if you had listened to Mrs. Tristram's account of the matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated for the sake of grander acquaintance. [...] "We were all very well so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no rivals--we were better than nothing. But now that you have become the fashion, and have your pick every day of three invitations to dinner, we are tossed into the corner. I am sure it is very good of you to come and see us once a month; I wonder you don't send us your cards in an envelope. When you do, pray have them with black edges; it will be for the death of my last illusion." [...] It was in this incisive strain that Mrs. Tristram moralized over Newman's so-called neglect, which was in reality a most exemplary constancy. Of course she was joking, but there was always something ironical in her jokes, as there was always something jocular in her gravity.|$|R
5000|$|The song has {{received}} mixed and generally positive reviews. [...] "We Are Golden" [...] {{is unlikely to}} change anyone's mind. It sounds like Jim Steinman doing High School Musical and features two varieties of choir - gospel and kiddie, in case you were wondering. Mika, meanwhile, flits {{in and out of}} falsetto whenever he fancies. What do we think? Well, the big old chorus makes his foibles worth putting up with... <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>have</b> to watch the video too. Nick Levine ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Added to which," [...] Hebblethwaite continued, [...] "he {{came over}} here charged, {{as you might}} say, almost with a special mission.

Since fermions in the fundamental representation are naturally quenched in the large N limit, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> only <b>have</b> a finite number of flavors, continuum reduction provides us with the exciting possibility to numerically solve large N QCD using chiral fermions and present day computers. 1...|$|R

"As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> great men, Spaniards, for our kings--and {{the descent}} {{went in the}} regular way from father to son--things went smoothly, because no pretender could have a shadow of claim. As between two foreign princes, each man {{has a right to}} choose for himself. Were there any Spaniard with a shadow of claim, all parties would rally round him; but, unfortunately, this is not so; and I foresee an epoch of war and trouble before the matter is settled. For myself, I tell you I would not give that flask of wine were I able to put the crown upon the head of one or other of these foreigners. Let whoever gets the crown govern well and strongly, tax my villagers lightly, and {{interfere}} in no way with our privileges, and I shall be well content, and such you will find is the opinion of most men in Spain. And now, tell me if there is aught that I can do for you. You say you must be on your way by daybreak. Tell me in which direction you journey, and it will be hard if I cannot find a friend there with whom my introduction will insure you a hearty welcome." ...|$|R
