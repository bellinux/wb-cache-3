40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistics}} of <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> of a quantum dot with extended {{contacts in the}} absence of time-reversal symmetry. The widths are determined by the amplitude of the wavefunction averaged over the contact area. The distribution function of <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> for a two-point contact is evaluated exactly. The distribution resembles closely the result obtained when the wavefunction fluctuates independently at each point, but differs from the one-point case. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations show that the distribution for many-point contacts has a power-law behavior at small <b>level</b> <b>widths.</b> The exponent is given by the number of points in the lead and diverges in the continuous limit. The distribution of <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> is used to determine the distribution of conductance peaks in the resonance regime. At intermediate temperatures, we find that the distribution tends to normal and fluctuations in the height of the peaks are suppressed as the lead size is increased.

40|$|Continuous pen {{pressure}} {{can be used}} to operate multi-state widgets such as menus in pen based user interfaces. The number of levels into which the pen pressure space is divided determines the number of states in the multi-state widgets. To increase the optimal number of divisions of the pen pressure space and achieve greater pen pressure usability, we propose a new discretization method which divides the pen pressure space according to a personal pen pressure use profile. We present here four variations of the method: discretization according to personal/aggregation pen pressure use profile with/without visual feedback of uniform <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> and the traditional even discretization method. Two experiments were conducted respectively to investigate pen pressure use profile and to comparatively evaluate the performance of these methods. Results indicate that the subjects performed fastest and with the fewest errors when the pen pressure space was divided according to personal profile with visual feedback of uniform <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> (PU) and performed worst when the pen pressure space was divided evenly. With PU method, the optimal number of divisions of the pen pressure space was 8. Visual feedback of uniform <b>level</b> <b>widths</b> enhanced performance of uneven discretization.
