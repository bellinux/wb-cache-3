40|$|As {{part of the}} {{technology}} validation strategy {{of the next generation}} space telescope (NGST), a system testbed is being developed at GSFC, in partnership with JPL and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which will include all of the component functions envisioned in an NGST active optical system. The system will include an actively controlled, segmented primary mirror, actively controlled secondary, deformable, and fast steering mirrors, wavefront sensing optics, wavefront control algorithms, a telescope simulator module, and an interferometric wavefront sensor for use in comparing final obtained wavefronts from different tests. The developmental. cryogenic active telescope testbed (DCATT) will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 will focus on operating the testbed at ambient temperature. During Phase 2, a cryocapable segmented telescope will be developed and cooled to cryogenic temperature to investigate the impact on the ability to correct the wavefront and stabilize the image. In Phase 3, it is planned to incorporate industry developed flight-like components, such as figure controlled mirror segments, cryogenic, <b>low</b> <b>hold</b> power actuators, or different wavefront sensing and control hardware or software. A very important element of the program is the development and subsequent validation of the integrated multidisciplinary models.

40|$|PhDCeramic {{injection}} moulding is already {{established as a}} production technique for complex shaped ceramic components. However the process is limited to thin section mouldings generally not exceeding a wall thickness of 10 mm. The global objective of this work is to describe and understand the aetiology of defects which preferentially appear in thick injection moulded ceramics, and {{to find ways to}} overcome these problems. The following stages are examined mould-filling, solidification, binder removal and sintering. Different moulding techniques; conventional moulding, modulated pressure moulding, insulated sprue moulding and <b>low</b> <b>hold</b> pressure moulding were applied. Moulding thicknessw as systematicallyv aried (15, 20, 25, and 35 mm) [...] Hold pressures and times were closely controlled and found to be decisive processing parameters for defect creation. The use of insulated sprue moulding prevented void formation in 25 nun thick mouldings and the application of low and constant hold pressures (> 5 MPa) led to a reduction of residuals tressesin the mouldings. An intensive study was carried out on the binder removal stage in which the catalytic removal of the polyacetal binder enabled removal of the binder from sections of 35 nun thickness. The reaction and transport kinetics during binder removal were studied and close observations were made out on various defects which could appear during interrupted binder removal. Differential shrinkage of the ceramic components during sintering was studied and could be tracked back to flow-induced particle alignment during mould filling. The sintering behaviour of the alumina feedstock used in this study was compared with an equiaxed zirconia powder {{injection moulding}} suspension. The phenomenon of jetting in large section mouldings and the creation of spherulites during solidification of the polymer were found to influence moulding structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} {{design of a}} bonding pad {{oriented}} square-shape ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection structure. The novel ESD protection structure provides adequate protection for IC chips against ESD pulses in all directions. The structure features deep snapback symmetric characteristics, low discharging impedance, <b>low</b> <b>holding</b> voltage, and flexible triggering voltage. It passed 14 KV HBM zapping and 15 KV air gap IEC stressing. The pad-oriented design substantially reduces Si area consumed by ESD structures on a chip, therefore generates less parasitic effects that degrade IC performance. The new design is especially suitable for very deep sub-micron (VDSM) mixed-signal and RF IC applications. Key Words: ESD, protection, bonding pad, mixed-signal, IC, SCR. ...|$|R

40|$|This study sets'out {{to address}} the {{question}} of whether the effect of organizational' performance measurement diversity on product innovation will differ depending on how organizational performance measures are used. There is strong empirical evidence that many companies who are successful today are less likely to be successful in the future because they fail to innovate. It is surprisingly then, that when everyone stresses the importance of innovation, there are many organizations adopting performance measurement systems, which may constrain their innovativeness. Currently, there are three differing perspectives on the effect of measurement on a firm's propensity to innovate. Moreover, each of these has empirical evidence to support its argument. The first perspective views measurement as constraining innovation because it impedes creativity, experimentation, and search in firms. The second perspective views measurement as helping innovation because it triggers search, facilitates decision-making, and increases risk-taking. The third perspective views measurement as having insignificant or little impact on innovation because it is used primarily for signalling. A possible explanation of the contradiction in the empirical findings of these studies is that they generally ignore how measurement is used. Therefore, using the behavioural theory of innovation, I argue that one possible way of resolving the contradictory findings is by incorporating measurement use as a moderating variable. Using data from a cross-sectional, large-scale, probability sample survey of 145 UK manufacturing firms, I show that organizational performance measurement diversity interacts with performance measurement use to determine product innovation. My findings suggest that the extent to which a firm offers new products will be more positively (negatively) associated with performancemeasurement diversity when diagnostic use is high (<b>low)</b> <b>holding</b> interactive use constant and will be more negatively (positively) associated with performance measurement diversity when interactive use is high (<b>low)</b> <b>holding,</b> diagnostic use constant.

Our decision problem is the optimal combination of risky asset and certain asset by maximizing the utility function under the VaR constraint that is limited by a loss proportional to current return. The empirical results show that the VaR constraint decreases the amount invested in risky asset gradually over time. We also note that volatility has {{a significant impact on the}} optimal solution. Furthermore, this approach is more appropriate when the investor sets a confidence level high enough and <b>low</b> <b>holding</b> period. In addition, this model allows us to better understand the form of the distribution and offers the advantage to the investor to take account of asymmetric and leptokurtic distributions of stock market returns...|$|R

Then, a number of optimal schedules were numerically computed for different cost ratio and the number of customers. On the basis of the numerical results and queueing theoretic intuition, it is conjectured that in each optimal schedule the inter-admission times are monotonically non-decreasing if arranged in chronological order.

40|$|The Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) {{is applied}} to the queue {{admission}} con-trol problem for a system modeled by tandem queues. The control takes the form of holding a customer in a controller buffer with a <b>low</b> <b>holding</b> cost until admitting that customer to the main queueing system with a high holding cost. An open-loop dynamic admission control policy simple to implement is proposed for a control of the queueing system. The basic idea of this policy is to ensure minimal interadmission time, 0, in order to prevent congestion in the main queueing system; 0 is left as a design parameter. A simple gradient estimate of the total steady state holding cost with respect to 0 is derived using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis techniques. A stochastic gradient-like algorithm based on this estimate is studied for optimizing 0, and convergence is proven under certain conditions.
