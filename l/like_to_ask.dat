5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

Should it be Hemp? No, that was too slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes — too much commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin?

25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{achieved}} mainstream {{success in}} the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance that was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: [...] "For our next song, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for your help. For {{the people in the}} cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery." [...] After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God bless you all. Thank you so much for having me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Monday 15 October, roadblocks were set up between Ruatoki and Taneatua by armed police, who searched and {{questioned}} everyone who passed through. After reports that a school bus was stopped and searched, police superintendent Wally Haumaha said these reports were wrong. However, the bus driver told a hikoi four days after the raid: [...] "The police did hop on our bus and they did search our bus ... they always held their rifles." [...] The organiser of the hikoi called on the government to acknowledge the incident and do something for the children affected by it. Speaking on Radio New Zealand she asked [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> that question why? [...] is it because we're from Ruatoki? Is it because the majority of children are Māori out here?" [...] Police maintained a strong presence in Ruatoki in the days following the initial raids and continued to question locals.|$|E
2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> all of you {{to see to it that}} the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E

2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E
