50|$|The unhappy triad occurs {{due to a}} <b>lateral</b> <b>blow</b> to {{the knee}} causing a rupture in the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and meniscus. Injury is most often sustained when a lateral (from the outside) force impacts the knee while the foot is fixed on the ground. The strong valgus or rotary force to the knee tears the ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus all together. This type of injury occurs often in contact sports such as football, rugby, or motocross. During the injury, the leg is laterally rotated and over-abducted. In about 10% of cases, the {{force is applied to}} {{the opposite side of the}} knee, and the lateral and posterolateral ligaments are torn.|$|E
5000|$|The sodina, an end-blown flute, is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} oldest instruments on the island. [...] There exists the more common and well-known short sodina, about a foot long with six finger holes and one for the thumb, and another similar end-blown flute over two feet long with three holes at the far end. Both are open-ended and are played by blowing diagonally across the near opening. [...] The master of sodina performance, Rakoto Frah, was featured on the 1000 Malagasy franc (200 ariary) banknote after independence in 1960 and his death on September 29, 2001 prompted national mourning.The conch shell (antsiva or angaroa) is a similarly ancient instrument believed to have been brought over by early Indonesian settlers.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} improvement of aerodynamic characteristics of RLVs (Reusable Launch Vehicles) due to <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> has been conducted. A square and a triangular cross sections of fuselage have been considered in order to investigate effects of shape of cross section of fuselage on aerodynamic characteristics during <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing.</b> And four different planform wings have been considered to evaluate effects on planform of wing during <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing.</b> Results show that <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> increases lift of the models {{over a wide range}} of angle of attack. Especially a significant increase in lift is achieved {{in the case of a}} “square” model at high angle of attack. Increase of lift due to <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> is obtained in all wing types over a wide range of angle of attack. The resulting lift of the model with small sweepback angle and a rectangular wing is lager than that of the other wings in high angle of attack region. As a result of calculation of landing process, <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> makes possible a shorter landing distance or a smaller landing velocity of a RLV...|$|R
40|$|Two {{schemes to}} {{modulate}} aerodynamic forces for roll and lateral control of aircraft have been investigated. The first scheme, called the <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> concept, consists of thin jets of air exiting spanwise, or at small angle with the spanwise direction, from slots at {{the tips of}} straight wings. For this scheme, in addition to experimental measurements, a theory was developed showing the analytical relationship between aerodynamic forces and jet and wing parameters. Experimental results confirmed the theoretically derived scaling laws. The second scheme, which was studied experimentally, is called the jet spoiler concept and consists of thin jets exiting normally to the wing surface from slots aligned with the spanwise direction...|$|R

40|$|Fractures of {{the neck}} of condyle usually {{are the result of}} a blow to the {{mandible}}. A <b>lateral</b> <b>blow</b> to the body of the mandible commonly causes a contralateral condyle fracture. There are many signs and symptoms of a condylar fracture, for example crepitation, deviation of the mandible to the side of injury, and spasm of the associated group of muscles. These will result in a functional disability, which is usually seen as a limited mandibular movement. This paper reported a patient with a fracture of the condylar neck. Patient had been treated with closed reduction and immobilization for 2 months. After that, she felt that her bite was changed, she could not occlude her teeth well, and she had clicking sound in the right joint when she opened her mouth. Besides that, patient had difficulties to move the mandible to the left side, and she could not open her mouth widely. The patient was treated with a repositioning splint and she had to do some jaw exercises. The purposes were to regain the position of condyle, to reduce the muscle spasm and finally got the normal jaw movement...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{visualization}} {{studies were}} conducted in a small pilot wind tunnel to determine qualitative effects of blowing a discrete jet essentially parallel to {{the leading edge of}} a 45 deg-swept trapezoidal wing featuring leading- and trailing-edge flaps. Test parameters included wing angle-of-attack, jet momentum coefficient, leading- and trailing-edge flap deflections, and nozzle chordwise displacement. Results {{of this study indicate that}} blowing from a reflection plane over the wing enhances the leading-edge vortex and delays vortex bursting to higher angles-of-attack and greater span distances. Increased blowing rates decrease vortex size, growth rate, and vertical displacement above the wing surface at a given span station and also extend the spanwise effectiveness of <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing.</b> Deflection of a leading-edge flap delays the beneficial effects of spanwise blowing to higher angles-of-attack. Nozzle chordwise locations investigated for the wing with and without leading-edge flap deflection appear equally effective in enhancing the separated leading-edge flow...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{consists of}} a numerical and physical modelling exercise on flow patterns, mixing, solid-liquid mass transfer, and slag-matte phase distribution in a 0. 2 -scale cold model of an industrial Peirce-Smith converter (PSC). Water, kerosene, air, and sintered benzoic acid compacts were used to simulate matte, slag, injected gas, and solid additions into the PSC. The 2 D and 3 D numerical simulations were carried out using volume of fluid (VOF) and realizable k-ε (RKE) turbulence models {{to account for the}} multiphase and turbulence nature of the flow respectively. These models were implemented using the commercial computational fluid dynamics numerical code FLUENT. Numerical and physical simulations were able to predict, in agreement, the mixing and dispersion characteristics of the system in relation to various blowing conditions. Measurement of mass transfer indicated that fluid flow in the PSC is stratified. Blowing configurations and slag volume both had significant effects on mixing propagation, wave formation, and splashing. As a potential process alternative to increase conversion efficiency, we propose a combined blowing configuration using top lance and lateral nozzles. The numerical simulations were conducted on combined as well as <b>lateral</b> <b>blowing</b> conditions, and the results of the combined concept are encouraging...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{technological}} characteristics of Keilmesser with a <b>lateral</b> tranchet <b>blow</b> modification on the cutting edge. It examines the underlying technological production of these bifacial objects: this implies the evaluation of their working stage succession, as well as produced forms necessary for the execution of tranchet blow performance. Furthermore, it offers a techno-morphological description of these enigmatic tools. The Keilmesser with tranchet blow and corresponding blanks of tranchet blows from Grotte de la Verpillière I in Germolles (Saône-et-Loire, France) are used as case study. The collection of Keilmesser with tranchet blow and corresponding blanks of tranchet blow has been massively expanded with new fieldwork and the review of ancient assemblages. The majority of the pieces were made on blanks from local raw material. The evaluation of the underlying production concept shows that a Keilmesser with tranchet blow, regardless of {{the wide range of}} morphologies and matrix size, always consists of specific parts that are necessary for the production sequence and the assumed function. The production of these pieces follows highly specific working stages, some of which can be interchanged in sequence. However, it is always the goal to obtain a low-angled cutting edge. The performance of a tranchet blow is not only an integral part of production, but it is rather the aim of the entire production...|$|R
5000|$|Allochthonous {{energy sources}} are those derived {{from outside the}} lotic system, that is, from the {{terrestrial}} environment. Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litterfall or <b>lateral</b> leaf <b>blow.</b> [...] In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that {{have been added to}} the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM. The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream. First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and leached from the leaf upon its saturation with water. This adds to the DOM load in the system. Next, microbes such as bacteria and fungi colonize the leaf, softening it as the mycelium of the fungus grows into it. The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004). This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for shredding invertebrates, [...] which leave only FPOM after consumption. These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM. Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, surface runoff, bank erosion, or groundwater. Similarly, DOM can be introduced through canopy drip from rain or from surface flows.|$|R
5000|$|The fourspine stickleback is the {{smallest}} {{member of the family}} Gasterosteidae. It generally has either four or five dorsal spines but may have as many as seven. It has an elongated [...] body that is spotted brown to olive green except for the underside. Its belly is silvery white. Males tend to be dark than females and develop red pelvic spines.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics in sideslip of a large-scale 490 sweptback wing-body-tail configuration having wing leading- edge and flap-blowing boundary-layer control. The wing and tails had an aspect ratio of 3. 5, a taper ratio of 0. 3, and NACA 65 AO 06 airfoil sections parallel to the plane of symmetry. The tests were conducted over a range of angles of attack of about - 5 deg to 28 deg for sideslip angles of 0 deg, - 5. 06 deg, - 10. 15 deg, and - 15. 18 deg. Lateral and longitudinal stability and control characteristics were obtained for 6 a minimized blowing rate. The Reynolds number of the tests was 5. 2 x 10 (exp 6), corresponding to a Mach number of 0. 08. The {{results of the investigation}} showed that sideslip to angles of about - 15 deg did not require, from a consideration of the longitudinal characteristics, blowing rates over the wing leading edge or flap greater than that established as minimum at zero sideslip. The optimum configuration was laterally and directionally stable through the complete lift-coefficient range including the stall; however, maximum lift for sideslip angles greater than about 50 was seriously limited by a deficiency of <b>lateral</b> control. <b>Blowing</b> over {{the leading edge of the}} retreating wing in sideslip at a rate greater than that established as minimum at zero sideslip was ineffective in improving the lateral control characteristics.

40|$|After a {{reply to}} De Wilde-Duyfjes, who commented {{on an earlier}} {{published}} treatment of the relatively broad-leaved sheep fescues, the Dutch small-leaved sheep fescues are discussed. Taxonomy and nomenclature of the small-leaved sheep fescues closely related to Festuca ovina is confusing. Until 2005, Dutch literature only recognised two taxa: F. filiformis Pourr. and F. ovina L. In Belgium, Great-Britain and Germany at least four taxa have been recognised: F. ovina subsp. hirtula (Hack. ex Travis) M. J. Wilk. and F. ovina subsp. ophioliticola (Kerguélen) M. J. Wilk. (= F. guestfalica Boenn. ex Reichb), {{as well as the}} two taxa already mentioned. In this paper, it is argued that the tetraploid taxa are best considered as subspecies of F. guestfalica Boenn. ex Reichb. and separate from F. ovina. Morphometric analysis of a part of the collection of the herbarium of Naturalis in Leiden (L) and the herbarium of the author revealed that all four taxa can be distiguished in the Netherlands as well. Festuca filiformis is the most common one and occurs on acidic and mostly sandy soils all over the country. Festuca guestfalica subsp. hirtula is quite common on acidic sandy soil of the <b>lateral</b> moraines and <b>blown</b> outs in {{the central part of the}} country (Veluwe). Festuca guestfalica subsp. guestfalica occurs in South Limburg, where it grows on heavy metal soils in the floodplain of the River Geul. The subspecies is extremely rare and in such decline there that it has locally become almost extinct. Recently, however, it was found on chalk outcrops in South Limburg and at a single locality in the Veluwe. Possibly, the subspecies may occur at other localities outside its known distribution area as well. Two collections from Apeldoorn, collected in the 19 th century, probably belong to Festuca ovina. No recent collections of this species are known...|$|R
