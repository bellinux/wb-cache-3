Starting with an 8-bit intro the song blossomed in {{to what they}} said was their most reggae track thus far. The subsequent album Bays was released the following year on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington where the majority of the album was written. Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in Wheels and Cortina Motors, which seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> evolution, and more soulful moments in Makkan where Dallas already resides.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} Bichitra Natak, {{believed}} to be Guru Gobind Singh, praises his own (Guru's) soldiers, {{as well as those}} of the enemy forces. According to him, the Guru's soldiers included the five sons of Bibi Viro (the daughter of Guru Har Gobind): Sango Shah, Jit Mall, Gulab Chand, Mahri Chand and Ganga Ram. Sango Shah fell down after killing Najbat Khan of the opposing army. The Guru praises the heroism of Daya Ram, and equates him to Dronacharya of Mahabharata. He also says that his maternal uncle Kirpal fought <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> Kshatriya and killed one Hayat Khan with his Kutka (mace).|$|E
25|$|Joseph Stalin {{favored the}} idea of a {{reformed}} Cavalry Army which the military initially opposed, fearing its vulnerability to enemy tanks. The concept of integrating cavalry, infantry and tank divisions (the future Tank Army) emerged as the Cavalry mechanized group (CMG) in the fall of 1942. The 1942 CMG functioned <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> Tank Army, but its infantry rode on horses, not trucks. The number of cavalry divisions was further reduced to match the number of CMGs (later Tank Armies) and the available horse stock, to 26 divisions by the end of 1943. These divisions acquired their own light tanks and increased to 5,700 men each. Their horse elements, although vulnerable to enemy fire, were indispensable in being able to keep pace with a tank breakthrough before the enemy could restore their defences. Normally on the night before the offensive they concentrated in a jump-off area 12–15 kilometers from the front line, and charged past it together with the tanks as soon as the first wave had breached the enemy lines.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It is unfortunate that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E
5000|$|In a more mixed review, Danny Wadeson of The Line of Best Fit {{dismissed}} The River as [...] "an oddly composed EP ... that flirts {{with great}} ideas and a lush sound that aren’t quite unlocked fully until {{they find themselves}} in other hands than those of Silver’s." [...] He criticized the EP for having remixes that [...] "actually help to find the original tracks find what feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>truer</b> voice," [...] feeling the original CFCF tracks lacked [...] "engaging beats." [...] The cover art for The River landed on a year-end list of the [...] "Top 25 Album Covers of 2010" [...] by Tiny Mix Tapes.|$|R

[...] Pitchforks Matthew Schnipper rated the album 7.8 out of ten, writing: [...] "Carltons voice is the key attraction on songs Liberman that register between low-key pop, rock, and folk." [...] The Boston Globes Ken Capobianco states: [...] "Carltons reinvention finds her a long way from A Thousand Miles - and in a better place, artistically." ...|$|R

[...] Jonatan Allin of the Danish version of Eurogamer, who had not enjoyed any Sonic games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan. Polygon's Griffin McElroy argued that Freedom Planet successfully performs [...] "a difficult balancing act, borrowing and transforming elements from games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Rocket Knight Adventures without coming off as derivative".|$|E

On realizing the identity of the wounded soldier at Kargil, Radio Pakistan immediately announced the capture of the younger Cariappa. General Ayub Khan himself contacted General Cariappa, who was living a retired life at Mercara, his hometown, with information about his son's safety. When Ayub Khan offered to release his son immediately, Cariappa is reported to have scoffed at the idea and told him to give his son no better treatment than any other POW. Singh recounts that Cariappa replied, [...] "He is my son no longer. He is the child of this country, a soldier fighting for his motherland <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> patriot. My many thanks for your kind gesture, but I request you to release all or release none. Give him no special treatment." ...|$|E

The live rendition of [...] "Party" [...] was the final uploaded video from the concert film on December 2. John Walker of MTV reviewed it positively writing, [...] "The sparkling, goddess-like centerpiece in a swirling sea of pink feathers, Beyoncé shines <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> showgirl on stage. Thankfully, unlike the 1995 camp classic, none of her backup dancers look nefarious enough to try anything funny". Walker further praised Beyoncé's vocals and dance moves as [...] "on point as always" [...] and the [...] "flawlessly areolicious bustier" [...] she wore.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{physical}} appearance, Form and Fuller explained that Freddy {{would be more}} similar to a real burn victim. Form later clarified {{that there was a}} fine line {{they did not want to}} cross when it came to making Freddy look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> burn victim. According to the producer, the crew had many reference photos of actual victims, which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing. Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen, so they opted to hold back on some of the realism. Fuller noted how horrific the images were, and how difficult they were to look at. The special effects crew that worked on The Dark Knight, creating the computer-generated images (CGI) for Two-Face's face, were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy's face. The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make-up that Haley wears. The prosthetics used to create Freddy's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement. Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make-up as [...] "pretty encumbering".|$|E

500|$|Most {{accounts}} {{agree that}} Nobin loved his wife dearly, {{evidenced by the}} fact that he was ready to accept his wife at first and run away with her, even after knowledge of the affair. In an era where the chastity of a wife was highly valued, Nobin's blind love and acceptance of a guilty wife were deemed inappropriate by a large section of society. Her murder was considered justifiable. Some songs criticise Nobin's stupidity of trying to save his adulterous wife and thereby risking his own life. Police reports, confirming Nobin's love, read that after the murder, Nobin rushed to the police saying: [...] "Hang me quick. This world is wilderness to me. I am impatient to join my wife in the next [...] ", a line reported verbatim in newspapers as well as used in plays and songs. Some public petitions argued that given a choice to leave Elokeshi in the arms of the mahant to live a life of dishonour—which was worse than death—and to kill her, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> husband, Nobin chose the latter to end her misery. However, some plays portray that Nobin has a mistress in town so leaves his wife in the village.|$|E
500|$|Kristan Reed of Eurogamer {{said that}} [...] "God of War II sports {{one of the}} most satisfyingly honed game designs we've ever come across." [...] He said that it would not {{overwhelm}} players and that it motivates them to improve their skills. He said that the balance [...] "always feels spot-on," [...] and the [...] "learning curve is just right," [...] adding that the magic attacks are more useful than those in God of War. He also said that God of War IIs gameplay, like the original, [...] "finds a comfortable middle ground" [...] between hardcore and casual players. Alex Navarro of GameSpot praised the pace of the game and the puzzle designs, and said the [...] "scale of some of the levels is unbelievably massive." [...] He also said that the story is interesting because it is more about what happens around Kratos, than what happens to him. Matt Leone of 1UP said that the strongest aspect [...] "is how it excels as both a story and an action game," [...] and it is the story that [...] "allows the game to feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> sequel." [...] Roper praised the scale of the levels, as well as the variety in environments, in comparison to the original installment, and said the art direction is [...] "once again absolutely outstanding." ...|$|E
500|$|Seeing their {{disadvantage}} the Spanish second-in-command {{assembled a}} boarding party, at which Cochrane drew off and pounded their massed ranks with shot and musket fire before drawing in close again. After having {{their attempts to}} board frustrated three times, the Spanish returned to their guns. Cochrane then decided to board the Gamo, and assembled his entire crew into two parties, leaving only the ship's doctor aboard. The British rushed the Gamo, some boarding from the bow with faces blackened to look like pirates, the rest boarding from the waist. There was a hard-fought battle between the two crews, until Cochrane called down to the doctor, {{at the time the}} only person on Speedy, ordering him to send another 50 men over. At the same time he ordered the Spanish colours to be torn down. Thinking that their officers had surrendered the ship, the remaining Spanish seamen stopped fighting. The British had lost three men killed and nine wounded, while the Spanish had lost 14 killed and 41 wounded, a casualty list exceeding Speedys entire complement. The British then secured the Spanish prisoners below deck and made their way back to Port Mahon. Stung that he had been beaten by such an inferior foe, the Spanish second-in-command asked Cochrane for a certificate assuring him that he had done all he could to defend his ship. Cochrane obliged, with the equivocal wording that he had [...] "conducted himself <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>true</b> Spaniard". Cochrane was amused to learn that this certificate had later secured the Spanish officer further advancement. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Speedy 6 May 1801" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
