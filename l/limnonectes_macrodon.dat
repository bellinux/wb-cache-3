50|$|The fanged river frog, Javan giant frog, Malaya wart frog, or stone creek frog (<b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon)</b> is {{a species}} of frog in the Dicroglossidae family endemic to Sumatra and Java, Indonesia. Records from other regions are {{probably}} caused by misidentifying other species such as Limnonectes blythii as this species.|$|E
50|$|Limnonectes shompenorum (common name: Shompen frog) is {{a species}} of frog in the Dicroglossidae family. It is found in Great Nicobar Island (India), its type locality, and in western Sumatra (Indonesia). It is similar to <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon.</b> The name refers to Shompen people, the {{indigenous}} people of the interior of Great Nicobar Island.|$|E
50|$|Mount Salak is {{a habitat}} {{for a variety}} of animal species, {{including}} frogs, toads, reptiles, birds, and mammals. During research, D. M. Nasir (2003) from KSH forest faculty IPB found 11 frog and toad species in Lingkungan S (Environment S) at Ciapus Leutik, Desa Taman Sari, Bogor Residenncy. They are the Asian giant toad, the Asian common toad, the Java spadefoot toad, the Indian cricket frog, Huia masonii, Limnonectes kuhlii, <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon,</b> Limnonectes microdiscus, Rana chalconota, Rana erythraea, and Rana hosii. The findings did not include tree toads and other mountain toads that might also be found there. At Cidahu, bangkong bertanduk (Megophrys montana) and katak terbang (Rhacophorus reinwardtii) were found.|$|E
40|$|Several {{millions}} frogs {{captured in}} the wild in Indonesia are sold for food yearly in French supermarkets, as deep frozen frog legs. They are commercialized as Rana macrodon, but up to 15 look-alike species might also be concerned by this trade. From December 2012 to May 2013, we bought 209 specimens of deep frozen frog legs, and identified them through a barcoding approach based on the 16 S gene. Our results show that 206 out of the 209 specimens belong to Fejervarya cancrivora, two to <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> and one to F. moodiei. Thus only 0. 96 % of the frogs were correctly identified. Unless misclassification was intentional, it seems that Indonesian frog leg exporters {{are not able to}} discriminate between the species. The quasi absence of L. macrodon in our samples might be an indication of its rarity, confirming that its natural populations are declining rapidly, in agreement with its “vulnerable” status according to the IUCN Red List. Our results show that the genetic and morphological diversity of the frogs in trade is much higher than the genetic and morphological diversity measured so far by scientific studies. These results underline the need for large scale studies to assess the status of wild populations...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Skeletochronology {{has been}} used succe 5 sfiIlly to {{estimate}} age in temperate and sub-temperate frogs (Halliday and Verrel 1988; Khonsue et al. 2002; Morrison et al. 2004; Reaser 2000; Ryser 1988). In temperate species, lines of arrested growth (LAGs) in bones arc usually distinct and arc formed during winter (Halliday and Verrel 1988; Reaser 2000; Ryser 19 S 5). Few {{attempts have been made}} to estimate age using tlus method in tropical frogs (Guarino et al. 1998; Khonsue et al. 2000; Kumbar and Pancharatna 2001; Pancharatna et aI. lOOU) and it has not prcviously been applied to Indonesian frogs. As part of a population study of three species of edible frogs in Indonesia, we examined phalanges taken from toe clips of Fejervarya limnocharis, F. cancrivora, and <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> to determine whether it is possible to estimate the ages of individuals of these tropical species using skeletochronology. For every frog captured, we recorded sex, body size as measured by SVL (snout-vent length) and mass, and clip code. Since each frog was numbered uniquely. phalanges used for skeletochronological analysis were taken from different toes. Fejervatya limnocharis and F. cancrivora were encountered in rice fields, and L. macrodon was found primarily at streams...|$|E
40|$|Amphibians are {{the most}} {{threatened}} of all vertebrates. Alarming declines of amphibian species {{is considered to be}} a direct consequence of extreme vulnerability associated with specific requirements of the micro - environmental conditions. Disruption of these conditions causes irreversible changes in species composition of amphibians, affected area tends to have lower diversity and abundance of native species. The most threatened amphibian species are those with narrow habitat preferences, living in specific areas where any intervention can lead to rapid decrease or complete disappearance of species. Habitat loss, intensive land use, fragmentation, invasive species, diseases, pesticides and climate change are the main causes of dramatic decline in amphibian species richness worldwide. Habitat loss, endangering many species worldwide, is considered the biggest threat to amphibians. Southeast Asia is currently experiencing one of the largest global deforestations. Many factors are involved in forest losses, e. g. Population growth, logging, changes in cultivation practices, infrastructure growth, politics, forest fires and global environmental factors. At least half of the forest loss is associated with human activity. Deforestation due to agriculture or livestock expansion causes degradation and loss of soil, microclimate changes and loss of biodiversity. An extent reduction in space required for preservation and development of biodiversity is the result of devastation of the environment. This process particularly affects the presence and abundance of native amphibian species. It has been proven that even low to moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbance have a measurable and profound impact on tropical species. Examples are conversion of rainforests to oil palm monoculture plantations, destroying the entire ecological niche, disrupting complex food chains and natural migration corridors of animals. Compare to forests or other woody crops plantations, significantly fewer species are found in areas with oil palm. The main aim of the practical part of this thesis is a field research carried out in two different island areas in Indonesia. The research was primarily focused on frog species composition in different habitats. Selected target areas were the islands of Simeulue and Bangkaru that are a part of a chain of islands on the west coast of Sumatra. These research areas were chosen for various types of biomes represented on them. Biotope of the first of the islands was largely affected by human activity hence a significant part of it is used for agriculture. The second island was never affected by human activity and is entirely covered with primary rainforest. On the base of research performed in farm area of the island of Simeulue, following frog species were confirmed to occure: Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Schneider, 1799), Odorrana hosii (Boulenger, 1891), <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> (Duméril a Bibron, 1841) and Amnirana nicobariensis (Stoliczka, 1870). Presence of two frog species not described on Simeulue yet was proven - Microhyla fissipes Boulenger, 1884 and Rhacophorus margaritifer (Schlegel, 1837). Presence of Hylarana parvacola (Inger, Stuart & Iskandar, 2009) was confirmed on the island of Bangkaru. Furthermore one, on Bangkaru previously undescribed species, <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> (Duméril a Bibron, 1841) was discovered. Richer frog species diversity was found in economically utilized areas on inhabited island of Simeulue. Frog diversity in the primary forest on Bangkaru, which has never been colonized, was lower. The results may collide with literature, indicating that a greater diversity of species is occurring in less disturbed areas. This proves that the abundance of species can be influenced not only by environment disturbance but also by other factors. In this case, different sizes and levels of isolation of the islands are probably involved. These findings are supported by the theory of island biogeography, which states that large islands have more species than small ones and islands close to the mainland have more species than isolated ones. The objective of this work was only a basic research; its findings should be supported by more detailed studies carried out in the area...|$|E
40|$|Frogs are {{harvested}} in Indonesia for both domestic consumption and export. Concerns have been expressed {{about the extent}} of this harvest, but there have been no detailed studies on the edible frog trade in Indonesia, or on the status or population dynamics of the harvested species. To investigate the possible impact of this practise, I collected data on harvesting and trading of frog legs in Java, Indonesia. I also investigated the ecology and population dynamics of the three species that are most heavily harvested: Fejervarya limnocharis-iskandari complex, F. cancrivora and <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon.</b> The first step of the study quantified the extent of the Indonesian edible frog leg trade for export and domestic purposes. Harvesting is an unskilled job and serves as livelihood for many people. There is no regulation of this harvest, and species taken and size limits are governed by market demand. The most harvested species in Java are F. cancrivora and L. macrodon. Harvests occur all year long. The number of frogs harvested fluctuates and is controlled by natural forces such as dry/wet seasons, moon phase, and planting seasons. Records of the international trade in Indonesian frog legs are available from 1969 to 2002; the mass of frozen frog legs exported has increased over the years. I used data on the relative weights of frogs and their legs to estimate how many frogs were represented by the export records. In 1999 - 2002 an average of 3, 830, 601 kg of frozen frog legs were exported annually; this represents an export harvest of approximately 28 to 142 million frogs, all with masses greater than 80 g, the minimum size of animals that have legs considered suitable for export. I used data collected by following frog hunters in the field to assess their capture rates and the numbers and sizes of frogs captured. I found that only about one-eighth of frogs captured are of sizes acceptable for export, and therefore estimate that the domestic market is approximately 7 times as large as the export market. In the second step of the study, I used field data on F. limnocharis-iskandari complex, F. cancrivora and L. macrodon to gain greater understanding of the population biology and dynamics of the harvested species. Populations of F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora were studied in six rice fields in West Java during the planting seasons of 2002 and 2003. Both F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora were abundant in the rice fields, with estimated overall mean densities of 193. 71 and 39. 76 per hectare. The mean density of F. cancrivora was very similar to that of unharvested populations in Malaysia (8. 6 – 91. 2 per hectare) (Jaafar, 1994) and was much higher than the mean density (0. 7 frogs/ha) found for Rana tigerina, the larger species of edible Indian paddy field frog investigated by Dash and Mahanta (1993). These comparisons suggest that densities of F. cancrivora in Javan rice fields are relatively high, despite ongoing harvesting pressure. F. limnocharisiskandari complex and F. cancrivora were able to breed continuously all year without an apparent season. Both species showed sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males. Both appear to be short lived. The population dynamics of L. macrocodon were observed at two stream sites West Java: Cilember and Ciapus Leutik. The habitat at Ciapus Leutik is relatively heavily modified bu human activity, while Cilember is in a nature reserve and ls less disturbed. A mark recapture study was conducted once a month between June 2002 and May 2003 (a continuous 12 month sampling period), and in January, April and July 2004. Skeletochronological analysis of phalanges removed during toe clipping suggests that this species lives longer than F. cancrivora or F. limnocharis-iskandari complex. Recapture rates of L. macrodon in both locations were low and more frogs were observed during periods of higher rainfall. In this study, more L. macrodon were found at Cilember than at Ciapus Leutik stream. It is unclear whether the low number of frogs at Ciapus Leutik was caused by over-harvesting or by other factors. There is a need for further monitoring to obtain a greater understanding of the population dynamics of this species. In conjunction with my field work, I measured a number of parameters to determine the type and extent of pesticide residues present in rice fields, and to attempt to determine whether those and another potential stressor, drought, might be affecting the morphology, body condition, or developmental stability of frogs. I also surveyed populations of the rice field frogs and L. macrodon for the emerging disease chytridiomycosis, which could strongly affect the population dynamics of the frogs. Two types of pesticide residues were detected in water and soil: organochlorine (lindane, aldrin, heptachlor, dieldrin and endosulfan) and organophospate (chlorpyrifos and diazinon). Six organochlorines type (BHC, lindane, aldrin, heptachlor, dieldrin and endosulfan) and three organophosphates (propenofos, chlorpyrifos and diazinon) were detected in the livers and leg muscles of both frog species. Almost all pesticide residues were low compared to the Maximum Residue Limit set by WHO and the Government of Indonesia although a few individuals showed higher pesticide residues contents. Pesticide residue levels {{did not appear to be}} related to any measure of frog condition or stress. Both species of rice field frogs exhibited relatively low percentages of abnormalities, probably within the normal range. Only F. limnocharis-iskandari complex consistently exhibited levels of fluctuating asymmetry in excess of measurement error. Levels of asymmetry differed between characters. Higher limb asymmetries were elevated in 2002 compared to 2003, whilst body condition was lower in 2003. It is possible that the lower body condition in 2003 was caused by stress from an environmental factor, in this case the drought in that year. It is clear that for both F. limnocharis-iskandari complex and F. cancrivora, fluctuating asymmetry is not a powerful indicator of stress. There was no sign of chytrid infection in any samples of the three species. To assess the impact of harvesting, I used two approaches. I developed a model of the population dynamics of F. cancrivora and ran simulations for ranges of parameters including harvesting rate. The simulation indicated that current levels of harvest may be near the maximum level sustainable by the population. My second approach was to compare data on the population biology and distribution of both Fejervarya species to criteria for assessing the conservation status of the species, i. e. IUCN Red Categories and the CITES Res. Conf. 9. 24 on the Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II. My assessment using listing criteria showed that neither F. limnocharisiskandari complex or F. cancrivora are qualified for inclusion into any IUCN Red List and CITES Appendices. On the other hand, more consideration needs to be given to L. macrodon. This frog is not qualified for inclusion in CITES Appendix I. At present, it is not possible to determine whether this species could be listed as vulnerable or in CITES Appendix II due to a lack of data, such as survivorship among stages, and habitat size, on the population biology of this species. Recommendations for management of the harvest include: 1) regular monitoring of this trade especially in other islands such as Sumatra by the scientific authority of CITES (The Indonesian Institute of Science or Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, LIPI), 2) regular monitoring of the numbers of export companies and their middleman, 3) developing a simple identification key and distributing it to the middlemen to ensure correct identifications, 4) assessing the possibility of breeding local frogs for this trade to replace the farming of the exotic frog Rana catesbeiana, and 5) ensuring that harvest is limited to species that are not adversely impacted...|$|E
