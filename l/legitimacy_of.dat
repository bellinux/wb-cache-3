In this introduction, we provide a detailed critical overview of current theories <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> and legitimation and demonstrate why they have only limited applicability in conflict and post-conflict contexts, focusing on the three main areas that the articles included in this special issue examine: audiences for <b>legitimacy,</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy,</b> and legitimation. In particular, we show how conflict and post-conflict contexts are marked by the fragmentation and personalization of power; the proliferation and fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> audiences; and ambiguity surrounding legitimation strategies...|$|R

30|$|Parkinson [18] draws {{attention}} to the challenges inherent in the classical deliberative account <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> (“the classical deliberative account <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> is incomplete, because it cannot account for why non-participants should grant legitimacy to the outcome of any deliberative moment”) and furthermore highlights the inability of a single event in fulfilling the requirements <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy,</b> democracy, and deliberation. He suggests rethinking the very core <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> – comprising representation, publicity, and rationality – in order to see the legitimacy following from several deliberative forums in a wider deliberative system. Such relaxing of the tight constraints of DD designs makes it possible to view the policy-making process sequentially, and therefore to view decision making, agenda setting, discussion, and implementation incorporating distinct means to secure the optimal level <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> in the post-war setting of Sierra Leone.

In an attempt to be as accurate as possible, specific conceptual links <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy,</b> namely those <b>of</b> legitimate authority and institution, are deliberately defined and a novel but reasonable guideline concerning the measurement thereof is provided. The research was carried out in three regions, namely in an area in West Freetown, in the provincial town of Kenema and in a remote village. Explicating the methodology followed on the field in a somewhat mathematical way, particular authorities were selected and their legitimacy was examined. This work also undertakes the ambitious task of comparing the sources <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> detected on the ground with those frequently given in literature. It ends by going a step further in investigating the outcomes <b>of</b> granted <b>legitimacy</b> over the diverse authorities for the state itself by taking the debate on fragile, failing and failed states into account. In other words, it explores the obscure link between ‘state fragility’ and the concept <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> Unexpected limitations <b>of</b> the concept <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> as an analytical frame, as well as its indisputable value are unveiled...|$|R
40|$|Since the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997 - 1998 the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) has been embroiled {{in an international}} crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> Assertions <b>of</b> a crisis are premised on the notions that the Fund’s voting system is unfair, and that the Fund enforces homogenous policies onto borrowing member states and that loan programs tend to fail. Seen this way, poor institutional and policy design {{has led to a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> But institutionalised inequalities or policy failure is not in itself sufficient to constitute an international crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> This article provides a conceptually-driven discussion of the sources of the Fund’s international crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> by investigating how its formal "foreground" institutional relations with its member states have become strained, and how informal "background" political and economic relationships are expanding {{in a way that the}} Fund will find difficult to re-legitimate. The difference between the Fund's claims to legitimacy and how its member states, especially borrowers, act has led to the creation of a "legitimacy gap" that is difficult to close.

40|$|Legitimacy {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as necessary for the resilience and success of revolution-ary groups, yet successful revolutionary groups are frequently viewed as illegitimate {{during the course of}} conflicts.

Combining historical research with analysis of the discourse used by the group to frame their goals and to cultivate expectations among constituents, I detail how the PKK took advantage of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> from various audiences over time until the associated expectations became unwanted constraints. I show how multiple shift-ing sources <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> allowed the PKK to be perceived as illegitimate by various audi-ences without compromising their capacity for resilience and success as they retained sup-port within a broadly legitimated movement for Kurdish rights in Turkey.

40|$|The {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> occupies {{center stage}} in debates on various constitutional developments. For as long as constitutional scholars cannot settle on a theory <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy,</b> the specter <b>of</b> a <b>legitimacy</b> deficit will continue to haunt the practitioners of constitutional law. Constitutional scholar Frank Michelman engages different schools of constitutional theory, seeking the definitive answer to the legitimacy question. He classifies theories <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> into three categories, premised on notions of contract, acceptance, or authorship. Arguing that contract-based and acceptanceoriented legitimacy theories assume the notion of authorship, he distinguishes constitutional authorship {{in terms of its}} presumed transtemporal character and abandons it because of this character. To cut this Gordian knot, Michelman proposes a presentist view <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> Through an analysis of his theoretical engagement, this article argues that his effort to abandon authorship-based theories fails. A commonly chosen, authoritative dispute- settling institution, in line with Michelman’s presentist alternative, cannot stand without assuming a transtemporal concept of constitutional authorship. Thus the Gordian knot remains...|$|R

It is upon this body that rests 'primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security' (UN Charter, Article 24). In this article, we examine the current debate regarding the legitimacy crisis facing the UNSC. We consider its most usual manifestation, namely that the Council faces a crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> because <b>of</b> its inability to constrain the unilaterally inclined hegemonic United States. But we also examine the converse argument that it is the whole UN collective security mechanism (rather than just the Council) that is in crisis. According to this, it is the failure to recognize the unique dangers immanent within the contemporary security environment and the inability of the UN security system to tackle these which is the cause of the current crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy.</b> International society, this position continues, must acknowledge these, and vest in the hegemon the powers it requires in order to meet its global responsibilities. Acknowledging the implications of both of these positions, we argue that the resolution of the current crisis <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> is to be achieved through a more expansive interpretation of the Security Council's extant powers, accompanied by a commitment on the part of the United States to reinvest in the multilateral machinery upon which global order is founded.
