500|$|Despite {{living in}} the countryside, Persona 4 {{characters}} were designed to look and sound [...] "normal" [...] and like [...] "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being [...] "more rural than was really called for". [...] "The characters aren't really ... They just happen to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that's not a major metropolitan area." [...] While interviewing members of Persona 4s development team, 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have [...] "more stylish" [...] hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country. [...] "With Yosuke in particular, I gave him accessories, such as headphones and a bicycle, {{to make it more}} obvious that he was from the city." ...|$|E
500|$|The new Chancellor Cai Que ( [...] ; 1036–1093) held Shen {{responsible}} for the disaster and loss of life. Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office. Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military. Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence {{for the next six}} years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of his choice. Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{has been}} one of history's cruel ironies that the blood libel—accusations against Jews using the blood of murdered gentile {{children}} for the making of wine and matzot—became the false pretext for numerous pogroms. And due to the danger, those who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where blood libels occur are halachically exempted from using red wine, lest it be seized as [...] "evidence" [...] against them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common [...] "full" [...] story is that of Maria turning ginger into gold to help one {{villager}} or the other. In these stories, Maria is said to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> known to the villagers, and interacts with them regularly. [...] The villager in question is often either a mother seeking a cure for her ill child, or a husband seeking a cure for his wife.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{of those}} living in areas without an eruv are {{accustomed}} to life without one and have adapted their Shabbat practices accordingly. However, those who <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that has an eruv and are visiting a place without one, or if the eruv is {{temporarily out of service}} (perhaps due to wind or snow damage), may have difficulty making adjustments. [...] Equally, those with young children, certain medical complaints and certain disabilities often feel trapped during Shabbat.|$|E
2500|$|The larva spins a nest out of silk on {{the ceiling}} of the cave and then hangs down as many as 70 threads of silk (called snares) from around the nest, each up to 30 or 40cm long and holding {{droplets}} of mucus. [...] The larvae can only <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> out of the wind, to stop their lines being tangled, hence caves, overhangs or deep rainforest. In some species, the droplets of mucus on the silk threads are poisonous, enhancing the trap's ability to subdue prey quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Lane at the Jardin du Luxembourg is {{situated}} in the gardens of the Palais Luxembourg. The Palais Luxembourg was built in 1615 for Marie de' Medici, widow of Henry IV, {{on the grounds of}} the mansion of François de Luxembourg, duc de Piney, that she purchased in 1612. [...] She did not feel at home at the Louvre and desired to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that reminded her of her homeland, Florence. [...] During the Revolution the palace was overtaken and became a state prison. In 1795 it became the site of the first Directory and then the seat of the senate for Napoleon. [...] The Luxembourg Gardens are now a public park and a place of respite for residents and visitors of Paris. [...] Among the treed grounds are fountains and statues.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it as best I could and I {{had a lot of fun}} doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2005, a {{group of}} more than 20 {{religious}} leaders from the Guilford [...] County area, [...] "including those of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist faiths", {{sent a letter to}} Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright, who said an oath on the Quran is not lawful. The letter noted that [...] "North Carolina is an increasingly diverse place and says that religious differences need to be respected." [...] It went on to say [...] "In North Carolina, we continue to be people who take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the Bible Belt. Today, we live in the Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt. It is imperative for our civic leaders, school teachers, judges, and law enforcers to appreciate and respect the religious differences found in our population." [...] The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case [...] "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to {{imagine what it would be}} like to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying [...] "That just feels like a slap in the face." [...] Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said [...] "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro." [...] The superintendent of the Greensboro District of the United Methodist Church, Rev. Frank Stith, said [...] "it makes sense for people to be able to use a book that means something to them", explaining [...] "The point is to have something that stands behind someone's word." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{consideration}} of this ought to bind us all, {{rich and poor}} together, against those wicked writers of the newspapers who would inflame the poor against their friends, guardians, patrons, and protectors. Not only very few (I have observed that I know of none, though I <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> as poor as most) have actually died of want, but we have seen no traces of those dreadful exterminating epidemics which, in consequence of scanty and unwholesome food, in former times not unfrequently wasted whole nations.
