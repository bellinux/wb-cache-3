5|$|Henry Dubar (who {{had helped}} recruit Doe {{personally}} years before) was promoted in one <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> captain to lieutenant general as Chief of Staff. From 1980 onward, Doe's systematic promotion of ethnic Krahn to sensitive {{posts in the}} government and military, began to drive deepening divisions within the AFL, among others with Quiwonkpa's Gio tribe, and to hamper morale.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E

5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E

5|$|Peng did {{not oppose}} Mao's collectivizations {{in the first}} phase of the Great <b>Leap,</b> <b>from</b> late 1957– early 1958, but he {{increasingly}} opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the problems which Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great Leap Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E

25|$|However, {{his real}} {{interest}} in jumping from bridges was apparently inspired by Steve Brodie's successful (if near-fatal) drop from the Brooklyn Bridge on July 24, 1886. In preparation for his own attempt, on August 24 he made a 105-foot (32m) <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> New York City's High Bridge, an aqueduct supported by stone arches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, MacAdam’s work shifted from being simply fibre art, to {{interactive}} spaces {{as well as}} a <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> muted colours to a rainbow palette.

25|$|Fry's party {{trick was}} to <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> a {{stationary}} {{position on the}} floor backwards onto a mantelpiece; he would face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and bow to the gallery with his feet planted on the shelf. Persuasion would occasionally get him to perform this turn at country houses, much to {{the interest of the}} guests.|$|E

25|$|Leixlip's main {{attraction}} {{in the past}} was the Salmon <b>Leap,</b> <b>from</b> which the town is named, a 5-metre waterfall on the Liffey just upstream from the then village. This was a popular place for Dubliners wanting a day out in the country, and the Salmon Leap Inn was built to refresh them. A hydroelectric dam was completed in 1945 and its lake flooded the waterfall. The dam generates 4 MW.|$|E
25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have contested {{the claims of the}} media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects {{are much more likely to}} cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be careful about making the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.|$|E
25|$|As {{a senior}} in 2003, he rushed for 2,960 yards on 252 attempts, an average of 11.7 yards per carry, and 32 touchdowns. After a game, players from the other team asked for his autograph. Following Maurice Clarett's {{unsuccessful}} attempt to sue the NFL over its age limit in 2004, there was considerable debate over whether any high school football player {{might be able to}} make the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> the preps to the pro game.
