6000|$|Something of {{all this}} I knew, and more pretended, with a {{mounting}} indignation at the fast-coming Doncaster Week which was to turn us out of our hotel. We began our search for other lodgings with {{what seemed to be}} increasing failure. The failure had consolation in it so far as the sweet regret of people whose apartments were taken could console. They would have taken us at other hotels for double the usual price, but, when we showed ourselves willing to pay, it proved that they had no rooms at any price. From house to house, then, we went, at first vaingloriously, in the spaces about the Minster, and then meekly into any side street, wherever the legend of Apartments showed itself in a transom. At last, the second day, after being denied at seven successive houses, we found quite the refuge we wanted in the Bootham, which means very much more than the ignorant reader can imagine. Our upper rooms looked on a pretty grassy garden space behind, where there was sun when there was sun, and in front on the fine old brick dwellings of a most personable street, with a sentiment of bygone fashion. At the upper end of it was a famous city gate--Bootham Bar, namely--with a practicable portcullis, which we verified at an early moment by going up into [...] "the chamber over the gate," [...] where it was once worked, and whence its <b>lower</b> <b>beam,</b> set thick with savage spikes, was dropped. Outside the gate there was a sign in the wall saying that guards were to be had there to guide travellers through the Forest of Galtres beyond Bootham, and keep them from the wolves. Now woods and wolves and guards are all gone, and Bootham Bar is never closed.|$|E

50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam.</b> The <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam</b> is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam</b> is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam.</b> A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam.</b> The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the <b>lower</b> spring <b>beam</b> also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom.
