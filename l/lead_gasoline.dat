40|$|We {{present the}} first {{annually}} resolved record of biologically available Pb and Fe in the Greater North Sea and Iceland during 1040 - 2004 AD based on shells of the long-lived marine bivalve Arctica islandica. The iron content in pre-industrial shells from the North Sea largely remained below the detection limit. Only since 1830, shell Fe levels rose gradually reflecting the combined effect of increased terrestrial runoff of iron-bearing sediments and eutrophication. Although the <b>lead</b> <b>gasoline</b> {{peak of the}} 20 th century was well recorded by the shells, bivalves that lived during the medieval heyday of metallurgy showed four-fold higher shell Pb levels than modern specimens. Presumably, pre-industrial bivalves were offered larger proportions of resuspended (Pb-enriched) organics, whereas modern specimens receive fresh increased amounts of (Pb-depleted) phytoplankton. As expected, metal loads in the shells from Iceland were much lower. Our study confirms that bivalve shells provide {{a powerful tool for}} retrospective environmental biomonitoring.

40|$|AbstractMultiple-energy-fueling stations, {{which can}} supply {{several types of}} energy such as gasoline, CNG, and hydrogen, could {{guarantee}} the efficient use of space. To guide the safety management of hybrid hydrogen–gasoline fueling stations, which utilize liquid hydrogen as an energy carrier, the scale of gasoline pool fires was estimated using the hazard assessment tool Toxic Release Analysis of Chemical Emissions (TRACE). Subsequently, the temperature and the stress due to temperature distribution were estimated using ANSYS. Based on the results, the safety of liquid hydrogen storage tanks was discussed. It was inferred that the emissivity of the outer material of the tank and the safety distance between liquid hydrogen storage tanks and gasoline dispensers should be less than 0. 2 and more than 8. 5  m, respectively, to protect the liquid hydrogen storage tank from the gasoline pool fire. To reduce the safety distance, several measures are required, e. g. additional thermal shields such as protective intumescent paint and water sprinkler systems and an increased slope to <b>lead</b> <b>gasoline</b> off to a safe domain away from the liquid hydrogen storage tank...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This article {{describes}} the personal experience and perspective of the authors, who had primary responsibility for drafting the initial health-based regulation limiting <b>lead</b> content of <b>gasoline</b> during the early 1970 s while employed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Data s o u r c e: Information used by the U. S. EPA in developing the initial health-based regulation limiting <b>lead</b> content of <b>gasoline</b> in December 1973 and studies documenting the impact of that and subsequent actions. Data extraction: Among the lessons learned from this experience {{is the importance of}} having input from independent scientists to the regulatory decision-making process. This also demonstrates the critical role of independent peer-reviewed research, such as that supported by the National Institutes of Health, as well as research conducted by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in delineating the consequences of lead exposure in the population. Data synthesis: Removal of <b>lead</b> from <b>gasoline</b> in the United States has been described {{as one of the great}} public health achievements of the 20 th century, but it almost did not happen. The experience of the authors in developing this regulation may be helpful to others involved in developing health-based regulatory policy in the future. Co n c l u s i o n: The initial U. S.

40|$|<b>Gasoline</b> <b>lead</b> {{additives}} contain brominated compounds. When {{leaded gasoline}} is combusted, {{some of the}} bromine can be emitted as methyl bromide which can contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion. Based on world use of <b>lead</b> in <b>gasoline</b> and on gasoline scavenger formulations, we estimate that worldwide use of bromine in gasoline peaked in the early 1970 s at 170 ± 20 kT/yr and that by 1995 this had decreased to 23 ± 2. 5 kT/yr. The fraction of bromine in leaded gasoline that is emitted as methyl bromide ranges over two orders of magnitude. At {{the upper end of}} this range, the decrease in methyl bromide emissions from the 1970 s to the 1990 s could have equaled the increase in emissions from use of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the same period.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of accelerator-based ion beam methods we have analysed PM 2. 5 particulates for a suite of 21 species (H, C, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Pb) to evaluate the contribution to Sydney (New South Wales, Australia) air associated {{with the introduction of}} MMT as a replacement for lead. MMT was discontinued in 2004. Teflon filters representing continuous sampling for a 7 year period from 1998 to 2004 were analysed from two sites: one from Mascot, a suburb close to the Central Business District [CBD (n= 718) ] and a high trafficked area, and the other, a relatively rural (background) setting at Richmond, 20 km west of the CBD (n= 730). Manganese concentrations in air at the background site increased from a mean of 1. 5 – 1. 6 ng m− 3 to less than 2 ng m− 3 at the time of greatest MMT use whereas those at Mascot increased from about 2 to 5 ng m− 3. From the maximum values, the Mn showed a steady decrease at both sites concomitant with the decreasing use of MMT. Lead concentrations in air at both sites decreased from 1998 onwards, concomitant with the phase out of leaded gasoline, attained in 2002. Employing previously determined elemental signatures it was possible to adjust effects from season along with auto emissions and soil. A high correlation was obtained for the relationship between Mn in air and <b>lead</b> replacement <b>gasoline</b> use (R 2 0. 83) and an improved correlation for Mn/ Al+Si+K and <b>lead</b> replacement <b>gasoline</b> use (R 2 0. 93). In addition, using Mn concentrations normalized to background values of Al+Si+K or Ti to account for the lithogenically derived Mn, the proportion of anthropogenic Mn was approximately 70 %. The changes for Mn and Pb detected in the particulates are attributed to the before-during-after use of MMT and decreasing use of <b>lead</b> in <b>gasoline.</b> The values measured in Sydney air are well below the reference concentration of 50 ng Mn m− 3. The incremental increases in air, however, are larger than expected given the limited use of MMT only in <b>lead</b> replacement <b>gasoline</b> and high quality monitoring should be undertaken in countries where MMT is used in all gasoline. © 2005, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The {{widespread}} use of ethanol brought several environmental benefits to urban centers regarding air pollution. <b>Lead</b> additives to <b>gasoline</b> were reduced through the 1980s {{as the amount of}} ethanol blended in the fuel was increased, and these additives were completely eliminated by 1991. The addition of ethanol blends instead of <b>lead</b> to <b>gasoline</b> lowered the total carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, sulfur emissions, and particulate matter significantly. The use of ethanol-only vehicles has also reduced CO emissions drastically. Before the Pró-Álcool Program started, when gasoline was the only fuel in use, CO emissions were higher than 50 g/km driven; they had been reduced to less than 5.8 g/km in 1995. Several studies have also shown that São Paulo has benefit with significantly less air pollution thanks to ethanol's cleaner emissions. Furthermore, Brazilian flex-fuel engines are being designed with higher compression ratios, taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol, resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of lead isotope {{compositions}} in unfiltered San Francisco Bay waters from 1989 to 1998 {{have brought}} {{new insights into}} the cycling of anthropogenic lead in estuaries. Isotopic compositions of lead in the shallow (< 2 m) southern reach were essentially invariant (∼ 90 % derived from 1960 s– 1970 s leaded gasoline) during the study period because of limited hydraulic flushing and the remobilization of lead from bottom sediments. In contrast, in the northern reach freshwater flushing from the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers produced seasonal and decadal variations in lead isotope compositions. The seasonal shifts are attributed to advection of soils containing late 1980 s <b>gasoline</b> <b>lead</b> into the bay during winter rains. Mass balance calculations indicate that only a small fraction (1 – 10 %) of this leaded gasoline fallout from the late 1980 s has been washed out of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers' drainage basin by 1995. Superimposed on this seasonal cycling was a long-term systematic shift in the component of <b>gasoline</b> <b>lead</b> expressed in the river systems, with a small (∼ 5 – 10 %) decrease in the amount of 1960 s– 1970 s <b>gasoline</b> <b>lead</b> in river and North Bay waters. The retention of <b>gasoline</b> <b>lead</b> in the river systems draining into the bay as well as San Francisco Bay sediments indicates that historic gasoline deposits may remain in the combined riparian/estuarine system for decades. Such a persistence is in contraindication to recent reports of rapid (annual) decreases in lead contamination in other environments, and the link between climate and contaminant transport suggests local or global climate change {{will have an impact on}} contaminant distribution and fate...|$|R
