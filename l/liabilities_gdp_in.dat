30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} {{empirical}} relationship between various measures of openness and labor productivity {{at the national}} level. As measures for trade openness, we use nominal openness, real openness, and import and export shares. To measure financial openness, we use the ratio of gross foreign <b>liabilities</b> to <b>GDP.</b> <b>In</b> addition, we use different components of this variable because they may have different effects on labor productivity. For example, FDI has {{a positive effect on}} productivity whereas external debt has a negative impact (Kose et al. 2009 b). We therefore use FDI foreign liabilities as well as equity capital and borrowed capital <b>in</b> relation to <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> the following analysis. As a dependent variable, we use labor productivity as well as real GDP based on purchasing power parity from the Penn World Tables. We use annual data from 1980 to 2013.|$|R
