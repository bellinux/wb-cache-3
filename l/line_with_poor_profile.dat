However, education policy, driven by a growing free-market discourse and policy initiatives such as localism, is increasingly pushing for greater voluntary action. This article explores the distribution of voluntary action for primary schools in one local authority area in England. Drawing upon primary data from 114 questionnaires completed by head teachers and secondary data from the financial records (2013 / 14) of 380 primary schools, we find evidence of considerable uneven dispersal of voluntary action between schools. These disparities are related to factors including school size, location, leadership ideology and the socio-economic profile of the school. The consequence of this uneven distribution is that schools catering for more affluent communities are more likely to have additional resources than those <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite initial {{response}} in adjuvant chemotherapy, ovarian cancer patients {{treated with the}} combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin frequently suffer from recurrence after few cycles of treatment, and the underlying mechanisms causing the chemoresistance remain unclear. Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network concluded an ovarian cancer study and released the dataset to the public. The TCGA dataset possesses large sample size, comprehensive molecular profiles, and clinical outcome information; however, because of the unknown molecular subtypes in ovarian cancer and the great diversity of adjuvant treatments TCGA patients went through, studying chemotherapeutic response using the TCGA data is difficult. Additionally, factors such as sample batches, patient ages, and tumor stages further confound or suppress the identification of relevant genes, and thus the biological functions and disease mechanisms. Results To address these issues, herein we propose an analysis procedure designed to reduce suppression effect by focusing on a specific chemotherapeutic treatment, and to remove confounding effects such as batch effect, patient's age, and tumor stages. The proposed procedure starts with a batch effect adjustment, followed by a rigorous sample selection process. Then, the gene expression, copy number, and methylation profiles from the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset are analyzed using a semi-supervised clustering method combined with a novel scoring function. As a result, two molecular classifications, one <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> copy number <b>profiles</b> and one <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> methylation <b>profiles,</b> enriched <b>with</b> unfavorable scores are identified. Compared with the samples enriched with favorable scores, these two classifications exhibit poor progression-free survival (PFS) and might be associated <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> chemotherapy response specifically to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Significant genes and biological processes are detected subsequently using classical statistical approaches and enrichment analysis. Conclusions The proposed procedure for the reduction of confounding and suppression effects and the semi-supervised clustering method are essential steps to identify genes associated with the chemotherapeutic response. </p...|$|R

Though their in vitro growth rate and intrinsic productivity of another angiogenic factor, {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF), were not changed by transfection, those clones with higher VEGF production were endowed with tumorigenic and angiogenic potentials as follows: firstly, nontumorigenic, lung carcinoma QG 90 cells having lower bFGF productivity acquired tumorigenicity as well as significant in vivo angiogenesis-inducing ability, secondly, tumorigenic colorectal carcinoma RPMI 4788 cells having higher potency for bFGF production could form more vascularized solid tumour with faster growth rate and thirdly, oestrogen-dependent breast carcinoma MCF- 7 cells, which did not produce detectable bFGF, acquired tumorigenicity {{even in the absence of}} oestrogen and the solid tumour growth rate was remarkably enhanced, accompanied with increased vascularization, in the presence of oestrogen. These results suggest that tumour progression closely depends on angiogenesis, and VEGF significantly contributes to malignant progression of a variety of tumour cells through its potent angiogenic activity, independent on the bFGF productivity of tumour cells...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) {{is used in}} {{research}} and clinical practice for assessing fall risk. We compared PPA test performance between people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls, determined the fall-risk profile for people with MS and developed a reference database for people with MS. METHODS: For this study, 416 ambulant people with MS (51. 5 [*]±[*] 12. 0 years) and 352 controls (52. 8 [*]±[*] 12. 2 years) underwent the PPA (tests of contrast sensitivity, proprioception, quadriceps strength, reaction time and sway) with composite fall-risk scores computed from these measures. MS participants were followed prospectively for falls for 3 months. RESULTS: The MS participants performed significantly worse than controls in each PPA test. The average composite fall-risk score was also significantly elevated, indicating a "marked" fall risk when compared with controls. In total, 155 MS participants (37. 3 %) reported 2 [*]+[*]falls in the follow-up period. Frequent fallers performed significantly worse than non-frequent fallers in the contrast sensitivity, reaction time and sway tests and had higher PPA composite scores. CONCLUSIONS: In <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> PPA test performances, falls incidence in people with MS was high.

40|$|Global mature microRNA (miRNA) {{expression}} is downregulated in cancers, and impaired miRNA processing enhances cancer cell proliferation. These {{findings indicate that}} the miRNA system generally serves as a negative regulator during cancer progression. In this study, we investigated {{the role of the}} miRNA system in cancer cell invasion by determining the effect of damaging miRNA processing on invasion-essential urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in breast cancer cells. Short hairpin RNAs specific for Drosha, DGCR 8, and Dicer, key components of miRNA processing machinery, were introduced into 2 breast cancer cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> high uPA expression and 2 <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> uPA expression. Knockdown of Drosha, DGCR 8, or Dicer led to even higher uPA expression in cells with high uPA expression, while it was unable to increase uPA level in cells <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> uPA expression, suggesting that the miRNA system most likely impacts uPA expression as a facilitator. In cells with high uPA expression, knockdown of Drosha, DGCR 8, or Dicer substantially increased in vitro invasion, and depleting uPA abrogated enhanced invasion. These results thus link the augmented invasion conferred by impaired miRNA processing to upregulated uPA expression. uPA mRNA was a direct target of miR- 193 a/b and miR- 181 a, and a higher uPA level in cells with impaired miRNA processing resulted from less mature miR- 193 a/b and miR- 181 a processed from their respective primary miRNAs. Importantly, the levels of mature miR- 193 a, miR- 193 b, and miR- 181 a, but not their respective primary miRNAs, were lower in high uPA-expressing cells compared to cells with low uPA expression, and this apparently attributed to lower Drosha/DGCR 8 expression in high uPA-expressing cells. This study suggests that less efficient miRNA processing can be a mechanism responsible for reduced levels of mature forms of tumor-suppressive miRNAs frequently detected in cancers...|$|R

40|$|Wounding is a {{prerequisite}} for tumor formation in v-jun transgenic mice. The progression from wound to dermal sarcoma is a multistep process which, at some stage, results in an increase in transgene mRNA expression in tumor tissue. However, transgene expression in individual sarcoma cells stained for Jun protein cultures is heterogeneous. We cloned several cell lines from wound-related v-jun transgenic tumors to determine whether a relationship existed between the cellular growth properties and structure, expression, or function of the transgene. Cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> very high v-jun expression had a high cloning efficiency in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. However, for cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> an intermediate or low level of transgene expression there was no correlation between transgene expression and the transformed phenotype. There was also no correlation between transgene expression and individual cell line morphologies, growth rates, transgene genomic DNA copy number, or mRNA expression of jun-related genes. The tumor cell subclones (1 - 20. 2, 3 - 24. 3) with very low transgene expression, very poor cloning efficiency, and low tumorigenicity also showed reduced activator protein 1 DNA binding activity and had an increased expression of endogenous c-jun when compared to other tumor cell lines. Transfection of a v-jun expression vector into cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> cloning efficiency and low tumorigenicity enhanced both in vitro cloning and in vivo tumor formation. However, such overexpressed v-jun had no effect on NIH 3 T 3 cells.

The CF recommender system performs very poorly for a new user <b>with</b> very <b>poor</b> <b>profile</b> information. Therefore, we investigate the use of quantitative association rules (QARs) for making recommendations to a new user by exploiting the cold user data which is readily available such as age, gender, occupation, etc. and ratings of items available in the historical data set. The proposed recommendation method, called QARF (QAR based filtering scheme), extracts relationships between readily available information of users and items, and the rating values. Additionally, QARs are extracted during offline processing which optimizes the online computation cost. The discovered rules are then employed during online processing in order to generate recommendations for a new user. Moreover, the QARF recommendation scheme is combined with CF, namely QARF/CF, to further improve recommendation accuracy. Proposed approaches QARF and QARF/CF are evaluated on the platform of MovieLens dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes enhance new user recommendations and outperform other state of the art CF schemes...|$|R

In group one the blood vessels (common carotid artery and jugular vein) sutured with polypropylene suture after inducing about 2 cm longitudinal incision on the vessel, in group two polyester suture was used in the same manner of group one, while in group three myo-steel suture was used in the same way of group one and two.

40|$|Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D) {{prevalence}} {{is growing}} to pandemic proportions worldwide. The link between genotype, environment and β-cell function {{is still being}} investigated. I have devoted the work presented in this thesis to attempt to elucidate the coupling of β-cell metabolism to insulin secretion and to look for casual mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations disturbing insulin secretion. In paper I, we showed that tight coupling between glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism is required for robust insulin secretion from β-cells by comparing two insulin secreting β-cell <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> good and <b>poor</b> glucose responsiveness, respectably. The cell <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> glucose responsiveness showed increased lactate production and glycolytic flux but decreased ATP production, suggesting a disturbed coupling between glycolytic flux and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Several metabolic genes that differed between the cell lines were found to correlate with HbA 1 c in human islets, reflecting long term glucose control. In paper II, a metabolic profiling analysis showed that a metabolic shift towards less glucose responsiveness and more anaerobic metabolism was characteristic for cells <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> glucosestimulated insulin secretion. Also, the hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF- 1 α {{was found to be}} more stabilized in poorly responsive cells. A comparison between healthy and T 2 D human islets showed that this mechanism may be occurring in T 2 D humans as well. In paper III, we examined palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in β-cells and found that cellular stress introduced by lipotoxicity directs metabolism more towards metabolism of lipids than of glucose. Together with this, the cells exhibited poor glucose responsiveness in intracellular metabolic flux and insulin secretion. Changes in metabolic flux were accompanied by changes in gene expression and increased expression of genes in the pathways of steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Histone-modifying enzyme activity and histone modifications on the genes Insig 1, Lss, Peci, Idi 1, Hmgcs 1 and Casr were found to be altered {{in a manner consistent with}} gene expression. This suggests the involvement of epigenetic regulations. In conclusion, this thesis suggests that the coupling between glycolytic and mitochondrial flux is essential for the glucose sensitivity of the β-cell. Alterations in transcription factors or gene expression could be underlying disturbances of this coupling. It also shows that a diabetogenic environment with increased concentrations of fatty acids affects metabolic flux in these cells, something that is paralleled by an altered expression of metabolic genes. Finally, it suggests that epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of these alterations...|$|R

Parties with emission targets are using it to buy greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for compliance against the Protocol's emission reduction targets. In parallel, the purchase of emission reductions through a voluntary carbon market {{has become a}} mainstream practice across business and individuals who, although not having any regulatory mandate, aim to offset their emissions. This voluntary market relies on mitigation projects {{which may or may}} not follow the standards of the CDM. This review compares these two instruments and traces similarities and differences in terms of project types, offset quality and contribution to sustainable development. It is shown that both mechanisms support a wide range of mitigation options and technologies, and differ considerably in the contribution of forestry and industrial gas offsets to their markets. There is not enough empirical data to assess the actual additionality and quality of produced offsets and their contribution to national and local sustainable development also requires further empirical assessment. Large scale mitigation options provide a substantial percentage of GHG reductions in both markets, with methane-based mitigation and fuel switching dominating over renewable investments such as solar and tidal. Africa remains the least benefited continent in both schemes. The review supports proposals towards reforming the CDM so that the least developed countries can also participate in a transition towards a decarbonised global society. Voluntary markets, in turn, are likely to remain driven by investors' willingness to support projects which are in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> countries' demands and priorities...|$|R

Meanwhile, neuroscientists suggest that episodic memory, through autonoetic consciousness, is crucially involved in the elaboration of the Self and subjective experience. This research empirically investigates the relationship between the quality of mentalization and the efficacy of autobiographical recall, and considers childhood trauma and psychopathology as possible related factors. Thirty participants presenting with either high or low mentalization profiles according to the Mental States Rating Systems (MSRS) were submitted to the TEMPau, a semi-structured interview designed to assess the quality of autobiographical recall from several criteria (episodicity, self-perspective and consciousness). Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The Symptom Checklist (SCL- 90 -R) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II) were used to assess global symptomatology and Axis-II disorders respectively.

We evaluated the reasons for and risk factors relating to ART modifications in an outpatient cohort in Mbabane, Swaziland. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of data for 782 patients who started first-line ART between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2008. Multivariate piecewise Cox regression models were used to identify potential predictors of treatment modification. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 21 months, 17. 5 % of patients modified their regimen. Drug toxicity was the commonest reason (77 %) while drug contra-indications, namely tuberculosis (13. 1 %) and pregnancy (6. 6 %) accounted for 20 % of the modifications. In the adjusted multivariate Cox piecewise regression model; after 11 months on ART, baseline CD 4 cell count 60 kg (HR = 2. 40; 95 % CI: 1. 43 – 4. 04) significantly increased the hazards for modification.

Dominant species of soil mites are species of Scheloribates spp. during 1 st～ 5 th years, then Suctobelbella spp., Qppia neerlandica and Trichogalumna nipponica took the place of the former species during 7 th- 11 th years. For the purpose of sandbreaking some grasses and young trees were planted on sand beach. The species number of oribatid mites in sand and litter decreased gradually toward the sea. Density of the mites did not show, however, a gradual change, but density in the plots of front <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> vegetation and soil was distinctly lower than in the remaining plots. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{oral health}} outcomes (perceived dental treatment need, untreated dental caries, gingival bleeding, periodontal pockets, and pain in teeth and gums), {{in relation to}} color/race inequalities among adolescents in each Brazilian region. The database included dental examination and interview of 16, 833 15 - 19 -year-old adolescents, surveyed by the Brazilian health authority, from May 2002 to October 2003, in accordance with international diagnostic criteria standardized by the World Health Organization. Prevalence ratios estimated by Poisson regression, and controlled by socioeconomic status and access to fluoridated piped water, assessed oral health differentials among color/race groups and country's regions. Except for periodontal pockets, prevalence figures {{were higher in the}} North and Northeast: perceived dental treatment needs, untreated dental caries, gingival bleeding at probing and pain in teeth and gums varied between 80 - 83 %, 75 - 76 %, 38 - 43 %, and 17 - 18 %, respectively, in these regions. Adolescents living in the Southeast - the richest Brazilian region - presented a better general profile of oral health than their counterparts living in the remaining regions; they had a lower prevalence of untreated dental caries (54 %) and unfavorable gingival status (29 %). However, the Southeast presented color/race inequalities in all oral health outcomes, <b>with</b> a <b>poorer</b> <b>profile</b> systematically affecting browns or blacks, depending on the oral health condition under consideration. These results reinforce the need for expanding the amplitude of health initiatives aimed at adolescent oral health. Socially appropriate health programs should concurrently aim at the reduction of levels of oral disease and its inequalities...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Collaborative Cross (CC) {{project was}} to {{generate}} and distribute hundreds of independent recombinant inbred strains derived from eight inbred parents. Although the project assumed a modest degree of extinction, {{it soon became clear}} that extinction was much more prevalent in this multi-parent population. With breeding to homozygosity completed, we can now estimate the extinction rate at remarkable 95 % despite considerable efforts to maintain <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> reproductive performance. Thus, extinction in the CC represents a unique opportunity to investigate factors that contribute to infertility, often difficult to study because of fitness pressure to purge them from a population. Here we provide the first report of a large and logistically challenging collaboration to systematically phenotype and genotype males from the last generation of CC lines when there were deemed extinct due lack of productivity. We analyzed fertility and a large number of reproductive phenotypes on the last unproductive males from 347 independent CC funnels and performed a trait mapping with the largest number of CC lines to date. Extinction in the CC may be due largely to male infertility, since 47 % of males from extinct funnels were infertile. CC extinct fertile and infertile males had similar means and ranges for nearly every reproductive trait measured, suggesting that a single trait is unlikely to explain the observed infertility. We performed QTL mapping across 39 male reproductive traits and identified 9 genomic regions significantly associated with features such as reproductive organ size and sperm motility traits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of trait mapping in the population, we validated a QTL for sperm velocity in an independent population and confirmed the observed allelic effect in multiple generations. Additionally, we identified a large region on chromosome X for genetic infertility driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype, indicating that genetic incompatibility between founders might also cause CC strain extinction. The results from this study will help us understand genetic factors associated with mammalian infertility, and will also shed light onto reproductive concerns and problems with current breeding of extant CC strain...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} the potential association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a surrogate systemic inflammatory biomarker, with clinical and pathological characteristics of papillary thyroid cancers. Methods. 205 patients with papillary carcinoma were identified from the institutional thyroid cancer database between 2006 and 2015 (55 males, 150 females, mean age 51. 2 [*]±[*] 14. 7 years). NLR was calculated as the absolute neutrophil count {{divided by the}} absolute lymphocyte count, based on the preoperative complete blood cell counts. Results. NLR was significantly higher in carcinomas with extrathyroidal invasion (2. 74 [*]±[*] 01. 24 versus 2. 39 [*]±[*] 0. 96, p= 0. 04) and bilateral (2. 67 [*]±[*] 1. 15 versus 2. 35 [*]±[*] 0. 96, p= 0. 03) and multifocal tumours (2. 65 [*]±[*] 1. 08 versus 2. 29 [*]±[*] 0. 96, p= 0. 01), as well as lymph node-positive tumours (3. 12 [*]±[*] 1. 07 versus 2. 41 [*]±[*] 1. 02, p= 0. 03). On the other hand, NLR values were not associated with gender, age, tumour size, histologic subtype, the presence of thyroiditis, and TNM staging. Conclusions. As an index of inflammation, NLR is inexpensive, readily available, and easy to extract from routine blood tests. We found increased NLR values in papillary carcinomas <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> histopathological <b>profile</b> and more aggressive clinical behaviour. Whether this systemic inflammatory response, as expressed by the NLR, represents the inflammatory microenvironment leading to tumourigenesis, or is a tumour-associated phenomenon, remains to be elucidated and warrants further study...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{successful}} of {{drug delivery}} through the mucosal tissue {{of the oral}} cavity represents a current challenge {{as well as a}} great future perspective. The need for more rapid onset of action and improved absorption of medications has resulted in great development of drug delivery technologies that use physical methods to overcome the barrier properties of oral mucosae. Areas covered: This review discusses the various physical techniques which have been, and are being, explored to sustain drug delivery in the oral cavity. In particular, supersaturation, eutectic formation, iontophoresis, electroporation, sonophoresis, laser radiation, photomechanical waves, and needleless injection are considered. Following a careful selection of the most appropriate site and technique, in agreement with local variations of the oral mucosal permeability features, physical methods to promote drug delivery can improve treatment of diseases. Expert opinion: Although physical methods are very promising to promote drug delivery through keratinized epithelial tissues, they are not extensively used on the oral cavity mucosae. The authors feel that, in the near future, these methods could be further developed to provide noninvasive and convenient means for locoregional/systemic delivery of drugs <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> bioavailability <b>profile,</b> short half-life and multiple doses scheduling. This review will help the readers in the selection of a suitable physical method for improving drug delivery in the oral cavity for future chances. The authors imagine that new formulations or devices will be marketed in the coming year...|$|R
50|$|Scott Mendelson of Forbes {{argued that}} a bag of mixed to {{negative}} reviews hindered the box office potential of the film. Unlike tentpole films which aren't as affected by critic reviews and fan reception, adult skewing drama films like Billy Lynn heavily depend on reviews which could either help or hinder the box office fate of a film. In this case, the bad reviews took a toll on the film. He {{also pointed out that}} the complex release format—which is the main focus of the whole film—failed to deliver its intended desired effect, which manifested in its poor box office performance. The Guardian cited different causes, saying that the Iraqi war settings—which don't usually resonate to American audiences—and the war genre itself as being tough-selling subject matter. War films in the United States are generally sold as action films, but Billy Lynn on the other hand is a drama piece. The film falls in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> previous <b>poor</b> showings of Iraqi war films, after Green Zone (2010), Body of Lies (2008), Rendition (2007) and Stop-Loss (2008). The only exception is American Sniper (2014).|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To examine {{associations}} of total sitting time, TV-viewing and leisure-time computer use with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers in adults. Design: Population based cross-sectional study. Methods: Waist circumference, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, non-fasting glucose, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and triglycerides were measured in 48, 882 adults aged 20 {{years or older}} from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 2006 - 2008 (HUNT 3). Adjusted multiple regression models were used to test for associations between these biomarkers and self-reported total sitting time, TV-viewing and leisure-time computer use in the whole sample and by cardiometabolic disease status sub-groups. Results: In the whole sample, reporting total sitting time ≥ 10. h/day was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, non-fasting glucose, GGT and triglyceride levels compared to those reporting total sitting time < 4. h/day (all p<. 0. 05). TV-viewing ≥ 4. h/day was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, GGT and triglycerides compared to TV-viewing <. 1. h/day (all p<. 0. 05). Leisure-time computer use ≥ 1. h/day was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> BMI, total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, GGT and triglycerides compared with those reporting no leisure-time computing. Sub-group analyses by cardiometabolic disease status showed similar patterns in participants free of cardiometabolic disease, while similar albeit non-significant patterns were observed in those with cardiometabolic disease. Conclusions: Total sitting time, TV-viewing and leisure-time computer use are associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> cardiometabolic risk <b>profiles</b> in adults. Reducing sedentary behaviour throughout the day and limiting TV-viewing and leisure-time computer use may have health benefits. © 2013 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R
40|$|This paper redeems the {{significance}} of the health reform movement and the municipal healthcare movement {{in the context of the}} 1970 s and 1980 s, and its social, politic and innovative power in the democratic reconstruction of the day. It then notes that the implementation of the constitutional guidelines, regulated in 1990 by Laws 8080 / 90 and 8142 / 90, has been characterized in the last 22 years by four major and mounting obstacles imposed by State policy on all governments: federal underfunding; federal subsidies to the private health plan market; resistance to reform of the State management structure of service provision; and the handing over of administration of public facilities to private entities. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) included half the population that was once excluded in the public health system, though these obstacles keep the coverage of primary care focused below the poverty <b>line</b> and <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> resolution. The conclusion drawn is that the real policy of the state for healthcare in the past 22 years has prioritized the creation and expansion of the private health plan market for consumer rights, and relegated the effectiveness of constitutional guidelines for civic human rights to second place...|$|R
