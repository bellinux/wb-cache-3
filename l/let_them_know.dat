5|$|After filming was completed, {{their public}} {{comments}} {{against each other}} propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within 11 days of its nationwide release, and temporarily revived Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford secretly contacted {{each of the other}} Oscar nominees in the category (Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick, Geraldine Page and Anne Bancroft, all East Coast-based actresses), to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage when the absent Anne Bancroft was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed {{for the rest of her}} life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{provides}} the Group with information {{leading them to}} Pocatello, Idaho, {{where a group of}} even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player {{a significant amount of}} funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, {{at the end of the}} fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E

25|$|According {{to federal}} {{investigator}} Rosario G. Sandoval Medina, former high-ranking Gulf Cartel boss Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez confirmed that Cárdenas Vela {{had ordered the}} mass kidnapping. Cárdenas Vela became the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Matamoros in March 2011, four {{months prior to the}} mass kidnapping. He was eventually arrested in Texas in October 2011, and the Subprocuraduría Especializada en Investigación de Delincuencia Organizada (SEIDO) federal agency under the directorship of José Cuitláhuac Salinas Martínez promised to form an agreement with U.S. law enforcement to interrogate him about the case. The family, however, expressed their disappointment with both Mexican and U.S. authorities for failing to cooperate. In February 2013, one of the Cázares family members confirmed to the press that legal procedure to interrogate Cárdenas Vela was unfruitful. One of the family nephews stated that he once saw the vehicles the kidnappers were driving (which were stolen from the Cázares) in Matamoros. He reportedly called the police to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know,</b> but they were unable to locate the vehicle or the kidnappers.|$|E

25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live {{for the rest of his}} life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>know</b> that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E
