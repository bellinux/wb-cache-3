5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{a system}} of forces acting on a rigid body can always be {{replaced}} by one force plus one pure (see previous section) torque. The force is the net force, but to calculate the additional torque, the net force must be assigned the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> can be selected arbitrarily, but the additional pure torque depends on this choice. In a special case, {{it is possible to}} find such <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that this additional torque is zero.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> {{pressure}} <b>line</b> : Line {{along which}} the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It {{has the same}} direction as the force vector. In general, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a pair of teeth. For involute gears, however, the tooth-to-tooth force is always directed along the same line—that is, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is constant. This implies that for involute gears the path of contact is also a straight line, coincident with the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> action—as is indeed the case.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, Ramanuja {{believes}} that Vishnu wishing to do a favour {{to those who}} are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles {{in the way of the}} attainment of God.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect to}} be considered, is the {{possibility}} to influence the force <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> by altering the cantilever configuration.The modification of the cantilever configuration will change the direction <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the resultant force. Depending on the desired force direction {{it is possible to}} add helices, or develop cantilevers with utility shape. As a general rule the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the force will be perpendicular to the structural axis of the wire when activated. Using different configurations a certain variation is, as seen above, possible. In the case of the curvature the activated wire will approximate the straight wire and therefore have a tendency to [...] "curl" [...] up shorten during deactivation.

2500|$|The novel had {{considerable}} success, but the leftist press turned against its author. Saltykov-Shchedrin in Otechestvennye Zapiski ("The Street Philosophy", 1869), compared it unfavorably to Oblomov. While the latter [...] "had {{been driven by}} ideas assimilated by its author from the best men of the 1840s", The Precipice featured [...] "a bunch of people wandering to and fro without any sense of direction, their <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> having neither beginning nor end," [...] according to the critic. Yevgeny Utin in Vestnik Evropy argued that Goncharov, like all writers of his generation, had lost touch with the new Russia. The controversial character Mark Volokhov, as leftist critics saw it, had been concocted to condemn 'nihilism' again, thus making the whole novel 'tendentious'. Yet, as Vladimir Korolenko later wrote, [...] "Volokhov and all things related to him will be forgotten, as Gogol's Correspondence has been forgotten, while Goncharov's huge characters will remain in history, towering over all of those spiteful disputes of old." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In poetry", writes Robbins, [...] "this post-symbolist {{attempt to}} achieve new forms {{had to break}} decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not {{correspond}} {{with the reality of}} modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried {{to solve the problem of}} simultaneously developing <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's Real Allegory which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet [...] "did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought".|$|E
