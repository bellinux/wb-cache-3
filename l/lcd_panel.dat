5|$|In May 2008, {{the first}} Blue Phase Mode <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> had been developed.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the <b>LCD</b> <b>panel,</b> or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E
25|$|WLED array: The <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> is {{lit by a}} full {{array of}} white LEDs placed behind a {{diffuser}} behind the panel. LCDs that use this implementation will usually {{have the ability to}} dim the LEDs in the dark areas of the image being displayed, effectively increasing the contrast ratio of the display. As of 2012, this design gets most of its use from upscale, larger-screen LCD televisions.|$|E
50|$|Most LED backlights for LCDs are edge-lit, i.e. several LEDs {{are placed}} {{at the edges of}} a lightguide, which {{distributes}} the light behind the <b>LC</b> <b>panel.</b> Advantages of this technique are the very thin flat-panel construction and low cost. A more expensive version is called full-array or direct LED and consists of many LEDs placed behind the <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> (an array of LEDs), such that large panels can be evenly illuminated. This arrangement allows for local dimming to obtain darker black pixels depending on the image displayed.|$|R
40|$|Complete depth {{information}} can be extracted from analyzing all angles of light rays emanated from a source. However, this angular information is lost in a typical 2 D imaging system. In order to record this information, a standard stereo imaging system uses two cameras to obtain information from two view angles. Sometimes, more cameras are used to obtain information from more angles. However, a 4 D light field imaging technique can achieve this multiple-camera effect through a single-lens camera. Two methods are available for this: one using a microlens array, and the other using a moving aperture. The moving-aperture method can obtain more complete stereo information. The existing literature suggests a modified liquid crystal panel [LC (liquid crystal) panel, similar to ones commonly used in the display industry] to achieve a moving aperture. However, <b>LC</b> <b>panels</b> cannot withstand harsh environments and are not qualified for spaceflight. In this regard, different hardware is proposed for the moving aperture. A digital micromirror device (DMD) will replace the liquid crystal. This will be qualified for harsh environments for the 4 D light field imaging. This will enable an imager to record near-complete stereo information. The approach to building a proof-ofconcept is using existing, or slightly modified, off-the-shelf components. An SLR (single-lens reflex) lens system, which typically has a large aperture for fast imaging, will be modified. The lens system will be arranged so that DMD can be integrated. The shape of aperture will be programmed for single-viewpoint imaging, multiple-viewpoint imaging, and coded aperture imaging. The novelty lies in using a DMD instead of a <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> to move the apertures for 4 D light field imaging. The DMD uses reflecting mirrors, so any light transmission lost (which would be expected from the <b>LC</b> <b>panel)</b> will be minimal. Also, the MEMS-based DMD can withstand higher temperature and pressure fluctuation than a <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> can. Robotics need near complete stereo images for their autonomous navigation, manipulation, and depth approximation. The imaging system can provide visual feedbac...|$|R

The system consists of two liquid-crystal (<b>LC)</b> <b>panels</b> within which physical objects can be placed. The back <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> serves as a dynamic mask while the front panel serves as the data. We first describe the principle of MUSTARD and then examine various functions {{that can be used}} to minimize crosstalk between multiple viewer positions. We compare different conflict management strategies using PSNR and the quality mean opinion score of HDR-VDP 2. Finally, through a userstudy we show that users can clearly identify images and objects even when the images are shown with strong conflicting regions; demonstrating that our system works even in the most extreme of circumstances...|$|R

Major hardware companies include Acer, Asus, HTC, Foxconn, TSMC and Pegatron. Textiles are another major industrial export sector, though of declining importance due to labor shortages, increasing overhead costs, land prices, and environmental protection.|$|E
25|$|The basic oscilloscope, {{as shown}} in the illustration, is {{typically}} divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a CRT or <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the graticule. In addition to the screen, most display sections are equipped with three basic controls: a focus knob, an intensity knob and a beam finder button.|$|E
25|$|Input lag, {{because the}} LCD's A/D {{converter}} waits for each frame {{to be completely}} been output before drawing it to the <b>LCD</b> <b>panel.</b> Many LCD monitors do post-processing before displaying the image {{in an attempt to}} compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video scaler must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag. Scaling and post processing are usually done in a single chip on modern monitors, but each function that chip performs adds some delay. Some displays have a video gaming mode which disables all or most processing to reduce perceivable input lag.|$|E
40|$|A microretarder for {{stereoscopic}} display {{is a film}} consisting of horizontal or vertical stripes with alternating null and half-wave phase retardation states. An LCD with a microretarder attached on the front side can display good-quality stereoscopic images when viewed with polarization glasses. It is now the easiest and cheapest way to present stereoscopic images on a flat-panel display. However, the space caused by the glass between the retarder layer and the LC layer of the panel seriously limits the vertical view angle, which, in turn, limits the application of this technology. In this paper, a process for thin-film microretarder is developed using reactive liquid crystal. The material and the process are essentially compatible with current <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> processes. Since the thin-film microretarder is to be fabricated in the cell of an <b>LC</b> <b>panel,</b> the retarder layer and the LC layer can be fabricated as {{close to each other}} as possible. A nearly unlimited 3 D view angle can be achieved for the display...|$|R
40|$|A real-time, dynamic, free space-virtual reality, 3 -D {{image display}} system is enabled {{by using a}} unique form of Aerogel as the primary display media. A {{preferred}} embodiment of this system comprises a 3 -D mosaic topographic map which is displayed by fusing four projected hologram images. In this embodiment, four holographic images are projected from four separate holograms. Each holographic image subtends a quadrant of the 4 (pi) solid angle. By fusing these four holographic images, a static 3 -D image such as a featured terrain map would be visible for 360 deg in the horizontal plane and 180 deg in the vertical plane. An input, either acquired by 3 -D image sensor or generated by computer animation, is first converted into a 2 -D computer generated hologram (CGH). This CGH is then downloaded into large liquid crystal (<b>LC)</b> <b>panel.</b> A laser projector illuminates the CGH-filled <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> and generates and displays a real 3 -D image in the Aerogel matrix...|$|R
25|$|It was {{subsequently}} {{revealed that the}} special committee of the trustees had voted four-to-three to clear Aguillard of wrongdoing regarding the diverted Cason funds. One of the dissenting votes was cast by Tony Perkins, a Republican {{former member of the}} Louisiana House of Representatives {{and the president of the}} Family Research Council. Perkins subsequently in an email to the Reverend Kris Chenier, the pastor of the Trinity Heights Baptist Church in Shreveport and the chairman of the special <b>LC</b> <b>panel,</b> questioned why the committee had implied that the decision to clear Aguillard had been unanimous, rather than by the margin of a single vote.|$|R
25|$|CCFL: The <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> is lit {{either by}} two cold cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps placed at opposite {{edges of the}} display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser then spreads the light out evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better color gamut for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12V) to ~1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of the inverter transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to twisted nematic field effect LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) <b>LCD</b> <b>panel,</b> suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E

The iPhone 6 has a thickness of , while the iPhone 6 Plus is [...] in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.

This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{displaying}} method, two-field driving scheme, {{was proposed}} for field sequential color LCDs without color filter. A spatially modulated color backlight provided multi-primary low-resolution optical stimuli, {{which were then}} compensated by an <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> to display detailed colorful images. That is, the manipulation on three (or more) spatial and two temporal degrees of freedom was sufficient to convey full color information. The simulation {{results showed that the}} proposed method achieved acceptable color reproduction accuracy, average CIEDE 2000 color difference. The least number of fields par-ticularly alleviated the demand for fast-response LC modes in sequential-type LCDs.

40|$|Polarization {{sensitive}} electroreflectance {{was used}} to study a typical hybrid photoconducting polymer–liquid crystal (LC) structure. Similar structures serve as optically addressed liquid crystalline spatial light modulators in real-time holography. It was shown that this technique might {{be used for the}} evaluation of internal electric-field changes in the vicinity of LC layer due to light-induced photogeneration and transport of charge carriers in the photoconducting polymer layer. A simplified theory presented in this work clarifies the experimental technique and the obtained results for the planar nematic <b>LC</b> <b>panel.</b> Employing the formalism of nonlinear optics for a particular type of LC (seven-component nematic mixture), we measured that the low-frequency (Ω/ 2 π= 1680 Hz) main component of a cubic optical susceptibility tensor χijkl(3) (−ω; 0,Ω,ω) along the director direction is χa(3) =(7. 4 ± 1. 5) × 10 − 16  m 2 /V 2...|$|R
500|$|The device's [...] LCD has a 1280×800-pixels resolution, {{giving it}} a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a wide viewing angle (178°) without {{significant}} color distortion, and enhances color reproduction. The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> uses a [...] "one-glass" [...] solution and a non-traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass—two that sandwich the liquid crystal, a touch sensor glass, and a protective glass—whereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a [...] "full lamination" [...] technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner display panels, but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting {{the quality of the}} screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass.|$|E
2500|$|Dead pixel {{policies}} are often hotly debated between manufacturers and customers. To regulate {{the acceptability of}} defects {{and to protect the}} end user, ISO released the ISO 13406-2 standard. However, not every LCD manufacturer conforms to the ISO standard and the ISO standard is quite often interpreted in different ways. LCD panels {{are more likely to have}} defects than most ICs due to their larger size. For example, a 300mm SVGA LCD has 8 defects and a 150mm wafer has only 3 defects. However, 134 of the 137 dies on the wafer will be acceptable, whereas rejection of the whole <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> would be a 0% yield. In recent years, quality control has been improved. An SVGA <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> with 4 defective pixels is usually considered defective and customers can request an exchange for a new one. Some manufacturers, notably in South Korea where some of the largest <b>LCD</b> <b>panel</b> manufacturers, such as LG, are located, now have a zero-defective-pixel guarantee, which is an extra screening process which can then determine [...] "A"- and [...] "B"-grade panels. Many manufacturers would replace a product even with one defective pixel. Even where such guarantees do not exist, the location of defective pixels is important. A display with only a few defective pixels may be unacceptable if the defective pixels are near each other. LCD panels also have defects known as clouding (or less commonly mura), which describes the uneven patches of changes in luminance. It is most visible in dark or black areas of displayed scenes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The field {{sequential}} color (FSC) mechanism {{can effectively}} generate multi-primary color fields in temporal se-quence {{to form a}} full-color image. Color breakup (CBU), however, has appeared intrinsically in conventional FSC displays to de-grade visual qualities. A novel CBU suppression method, color fields arrangement (CFA), was proposed to eliminate the artifacts for FSC liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The modified order of consecutive color fields results in superimposed color images on a retina without CBU. Additionally, the 4 -CFA method with a field rate of 240 Hz was found to avoid the flicker phenomenon on static images. The proposed method was successfully implemented on a 5. 6 -in optically compensated bend (OCB) <b>LC</b> <b>panel.</b> Our results confirm that the visibility of CBU artifacts can be reduced as the evaluation of dynamic and static models.

40|$|Abstract—A full-color {{image on}} field {{sequential}} color (FSC) dis-plays {{is composed of}} color fields in temporal sequence. With the FSC mechanism, color filters of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) can be removed to heighten the light efficiency and lower the mate-rial cost.

A novel gray level determination of liquid crystal and backlight (LC/BL) was proposed to suppress the CBU artifact on FSC-LCDs. Based on the image content in each frame, a dominated color-mixed field was found to minimize the color difference between the CBU and original image.

40|$|Abstract—Field-sequential color (FSC) {{is a high}} optical {{throughput}} {{technique for}} future green liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, the FSC-LCD faces a lethal issue, color breakup (CBU) which degrades image clarity and prevents high level LCD-TV productions. We proposed the “ 180 Hz Stencil Field-Se-quential-Color ” method to redistribute intensities of the three primary color field-images to suppress CBU. By applying local color-backlight-dimming technology to FSC-LCDs, a low reso-lution colorful backlight panel combined with a high resolution color filter-less <b>LC</b> <b>panel</b> generated a “green-based multi-color” field-image which showed the most image luminance in the first field. Therefore, residual red and blue field-image intensities were reduced and effectively suppressed CBU when compared to field-rate increasing methods. In addition, to further implement hardware, the number of backlight divisions of 32 24 and a proper Gaussian point spread function profile were optimized via simulations while considering CBU reduction and image fidelity. Using optimized hardware parameters, the CBU phenomenon was suppressed by 50 % of traditional RGB driving in simulation and was demonstrated on a 120 Hz 46 -inch MVA LCD-TV.

30|$|LCOS–SLMs combine {{complementary}} {{metal oxide}} semiconductor technology and properties of LC, allowing to modulate either polarization or phase of light. However, contrary to conventional <b>LC</b> <b>panels,</b> LCOS devices operate via reflection of the beam instead of transmission. The various types of arrangement of the liquid crystal layers in the device allow to modulate incident light beams in distinct ways. The electro-optic effects that are responsible for such modulation depend on the voltage applied to the LC material layer. The stringent requirements of the industry stipulate the development of advanced light modulation. As a result, many variations of electro-optics structures, also called LC modes, in LCOS devices have been studied. Among them are: vertically aligned nematic [109 – 111], twisted nematic [112], hybrid field effect liquid crystal [113], electrically controlled birefringence [114, 115], optical compensated bend or pi-cell [116], surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal [117 – 121]. Most of these types of LCOS devices achieve light modulation via rotation of linear polarization of the incident light beam. The switching rate of a ferroelectric liquid crystal device reaches up to 1  kHz, but the drawback {{is that it is a}} binary mode only device. For other types of LC–SLMs the switch rate ranges in several hundreds of Hz, but they can achieve a variety of arbitrary force potentials.|$|R

LC-TVs suffer from blurringand color separation of images when expressing moving objects. These artifacts can be reduced byhigh speed and precise on-off control of light which can be performed by LEDs without difficulty. To reduce power consumption, local dimming operation as well as independent luminance controlof red, green, and blue LEDs are required. This can never be realized with white CCFLs. Eleven-bit gray levels can be expressed with a precise control of LEDs at low luminance levels. This allows to design arbitrary gamma characteristics of displayed images, and also to enhancecontrast. LEDs’ narrow emission spectra yield wider color gamut compared to other technologies. Another important feature of LEDs {{is that they do}} not contain mercury, unlike CCFLs, andtherefore there is no environmental concern. One of the negative features is high cost.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} {{in a number of}} R&D areas that are believed to provide `key technologies' for the further development of a novel, digital, broadcast 3 D-TV system. The provided results are part of the outcome of the European IST (Information Society Technologies) project ATTEST (Advanced Three-Dimensional Television System Technologies), a two-year research initiative that was finalized in March 2004. The paper covers essential parts of the envisaged 3 D signal processing chain such as the real-time generation of ``virtual'' stereoscopic views from monoscopic color video and associated per-pixel depth information as well as the efficient compression and the backwards-compatible transmission of this advanced data representation format using state-of-the-art video coding standards such as MPEG- 2 (color data) and MPEG- 4 Visual, resp. Advanced Video Coding (depth data). Furthermore, the paper also describes the development of a new, autostereoscopic single-user 3 D-TV display (Free 2 C).

The Cason Foundation, which had donated $5 million to LC to fund the school, {{announced}} that it will no longer financially support the college because of [...] "actions of President Aguillard which we believe to be unethical and potentially illegal." [...] Edgar D. Cason and his wife, Flora Jean Caskey Cason, of Coushatta in Red River Parish, who established the foundation, informed LC trustees by letter on April 15, 2013, that the foundation was terminating its ties to LC. A probe conducted by a law firm in New Orleans claims that Aguillard had improperly diverted nearly $60,000 in divinity school donations to LC projects in Tanzania, Africa. A committee of five LC board members, however, defended Aguillard and maintain that he did not act improperly regarding the funds. Cason, a wealthy timber operator, farmer, and cattleman, has supported conservative Republican candidates, including Santorum for President, and issues, such as the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. Cason questioned why the LC trustees did not permit him to address the board at its March meeting. In a private executive session of the trustees on March 18 and 19, 2013, two motions regarding Aguillard were defeated. One called for his outright removal; another proposed administrative leave. Aguillard submitted a statement to the Alexandria Daily Town Talk in which he declared the executive session to have been [...] "productive. I am looking forward to leading Louisiana College into the best days God has prepared for us." [...] It was subsequently revealed that the special committee of the trustees had voted four-to-three to clear Aguillard of wrongdoing regarding the diverted Cason funds. One of the dissenting votes was cast by Tony Perkins, a Republican former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives {{and the president of the}} Family Research Council. Perkins subsequently in an email to the Reverend Kris Chenier, the pastor of the Trinity Heights Baptist Church in Shreveport and the chairman of the special <b>LC</b> <b>panel,</b> questioned why the committee had implied that the decision to clear Aguillard had been unanimous, rather than by the margin of a single vote.|$|R
