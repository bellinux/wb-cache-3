The characteristics of the ship target recognition in SAR imagery are <b>listed.</b> <b>Ship</b> target recognition techniques are introduced. And the ship detection and recognition algorithms have been reviewed and analyzed. The main problems on ship detection and recognition process {{have been described as}} well. and a possible direction of development are given. It is expected that the researchers will obtain useful information from this paper, which will help for their future works and promote the SAR image target detection and identification of ship development.
