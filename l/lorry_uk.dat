5000|$|A {{dump truck}} (known in the UK as a dumper/tipper truck) is a truck used for {{transporting}} loose material (such as sand, gravel, or demolition waste) for construction. A typical dump truck {{is equipped with}} an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic pistons to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be deposited ("dumped") on the ground behind the truck {{at the site of}} delivery. In the UK, Australia and India the term applies to off-road construction plant only, and the road vehicle is known as a tipper, tipper <b>lorry</b> (<b>UK,</b> India) or tip truck (AU).|$|E
50|$|A holding tank, {{also called}} a waste water holding tank or black (water) tank, is a {{container}} for storing sewage in {{vehicles equipped with}} toilets. Vehicles that employ holding tanks include recreational vehicles (RVs), trucks (U.S. usage) or <b>lorries</b> (<b>UK</b> usage), railroad trains, boats, aircraft, and even spacecraft. The contents are emptied into a dump station, which discharges the raw sewage into a sewage treatment system.|$|R
50|$|As much as 35% of truck miles {{travelled}} on Germany’s motorways (Autobahnen) {{are generated}} by foreign <b>lorries</b> (<b>UK</b> Commission for Integrated Transport, 2007). Facing increased pressure from freight traffic passing through and needing an additional {{source of revenue}} for motorway maintenance and expansion, in January 2005 Germany implemented a distance-based toll for all lorries of more than twelve tonnes gross weight (later reduced to 7.5 tonnes) using the motorways (Autobahnen). The motorway freight tolling was authorized by the Motorway Toll Act for Heavy Goods Vehicles (introduced on 12 April 2002) and the Toll Regulation (Toll Collect, 2007).|$|R
50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad cars such as hopper cars, gondolas or <b>lorries</b> (tipplers, <b>UK).</b> It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R
50|$|Fresnel lenses {{are used}} in {{left-hand-drive}} European <b>lorries</b> entering the <b>UK</b> and Republic of Ireland (and vice versa, right-hand-drive Irish and British trucks entering mainland Europe) to overcome the blind spots caused by the driver operating the lorry while sitting {{on the wrong side}} of the cab relative to the side of the road the car is on. They attach to the passenger-side window.|$|R
5000|$|Reversing (also {{known as}} backing up) {{is the process}} of driving a vehicle in the reverse {{direction}} in order to maneuver. Rear view mirrors are standard equipment for this endeavor. Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras. Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a warning beep whilst reversing. In the <b>UK</b> <b>lorries</b> may be fitted with warning devices which repeatedly announce [...] "This vehicle is reversing", or the equivalent phrase in Welsh.|$|R
50|$|<b>UK</b> <b>lorries</b> are now {{fitted with}} an impact {{absorbing}} rear barrier, meeting {{one of the}} recommendations.Investigation techniques included interviews with police, hospitals, survivors and coroners to study ways in which vehicle design could be changed to avoid accidents {{in the first place}} and to mitigate the injuries caused.Speaking in 2002, the former director of the hospital's research unit, Dr John Bull credited the unit with calling for mandatory seatbelt installation in new vehicles and compulsory wearing of motorbike crash helmets. The AA provided some money for research.|$|R
50|$|Since 1992, {{weight and}} axles limits for goods {{carrying}} lorries in the United Kingdom had increased in stages from 38 t and 5 axles. , vehicles {{are limited to}} a maximum of 6 axles, and limited to an overall maximum weight of 44 t and 16.5 m in length for articulated lorries, and 44 t and 18.75 m for drawbar lorries. The restriction on overall length is why the majority of <b>UK</b> <b>lorries</b> are hauled by 'cab over' tractor units, although for the minority of UK uses where the weight limit is reached before the length limit, conventional trucks are legal.|$|R
50|$|A26 {{is named}} the autoroute des Anglais (motorway of the English) as it leads from Calais, {{the main point}} of arrival for cars and <b>lorries</b> from the <b>UK.</b> It {{continues}} to Troyes, and just happens to pass straight through the Champagne region, whose wines are so loved by the British. In addition it threads through {{and close to the}} sites of the most famous battles fought by the British Army in World War I, such as Arras, Cambrai and the Somme and not far from Ypres and Mons in Belgium. It also passes sites of earlier UK interest such as Crecy and The Field of the Cloth of Gold.|$|R
50|$|Freight {{transport}} {{has undergone}} similar changes, increasing in volume and shifting from railways onto the road. In 1953 89 billion tonne kilometres of goods were moved, with rail accounting for 42%, road 36% and water 22%. By 2010 {{the volume of}} freight moved had more than doubled to 222 billion tonne kilometres, of which 9% was moved by rail, 19% by water, 5% by pipeline and 68% by road. Despite the growth in tonne kilometres, the environmental external costs of trucks and <b>lorries</b> in the <b>UK</b> have reportedly decreased. Between 1990 and 2000, {{there has been a}} move to heavier goods vehicles due to major changes in the haulage industry including a shift in sales to larger articulated vehicles. A larger than average fleet turnover has ensured a swift introduction of new and cleaner vehicles in the UK.|$|R

Objectives: To {{undertake}} a process-evaluation of a Structured Health Intervention for Truckers (SHIFT) implemented {{in a sample}} of <b>UK</b> <b>lorry</b> drivers. Methods: A combination of ‘debrief interviews’, focus groups and one-to-one interviews, in addition to observations and reflections of the two lead researchers were used to collect data on the acceptability of SHIFT from a group of 16 lorry drivers and 4 transport managers. Results: The SHIFT program was considered relevant and acceptable to lorry drivers. It provided them with health information tailored to their specific health needs, long-lasting tools and techniques, which helped to raise their awareness of key health issues and helped to stimulate lifestyle changes during their daily routine. Conclusion: This process-evaluation suggests that the SHIFT program should now be evaluated on a larger scale and tested through fully randomised controlled trials...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Prolonged time sitting {{has been linked to}} an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), all-cause mortality, diabetes and some cancers. Workers in occupations where there is no alternative to sitting can best be defined as compulsory sedentary workers, which involve bus and lorry drivers amongst others. Limited research is available on the health behaviours and health profiles of individuals working within these occupations. This thesis adopts a mixed methods approach and fits within the MRC framework for the development of complex interventions to specifically investigate bus and lorry drivers sedentary behaviours and physical activity levels in association with their cardiovascular health. Chapter 3 describes a pilot study, which results showed bus drivers accumulate 12 hours sitting on workdays and presented higher than the recommended ranges for BMI, body fat, waist circumference and blood pressure. Chapter 4 explores the validity of using an ActiGraph accelerometer compared to the activPAL to assess bus drivers sedentary behaviours. Results highlight that compared to the activPAL, the ActiGraph underestimates sedentary time during workdays (151 minutes/day) and working hours (172 min/day). Chapter 5 phenotypes <b>UK</b> <b>lorry</b> drivers sedentary behaviours and non-sedentary behaviours during workdays and non-workdays and examines lorry drivers markers of cardiovascular health. Lorry drivers accumulate 13 hours sitting on workdays and 8 hours on non-workdays and presented an ill-cardiovascular profile. Chapter 6 examines the effects of an intervention designed to promote PA and reduce sedentary time on a range of cardiovascular risk factors in a sample of lorry drivers. Chapter 7 presents a process evaluation of the Structured Health Intervention for Truckers (SHIFT) programme described in Chapter 6. This thesis highlights that bus and lorry drivers accumulate the highest amount of sitting time reported up to date, together with high levels of physical inactivity and an ill-cardiovascular profile. However, positive changes in cardiovascular risk factors were observed when drivers increased their daily average of step counts. Overall, these results emphasise that targeting bus and lorry drivers health behaviours should be a public health priority...|$|R

The two legal entry channels for low skilled migrants with view of long term residence: 1) 	asylum 2) 	family reunification. Regularisation on an ad hoc basis also provides a channel for obtaining residence and settlement rights. Legal entry for a short-term residence include: students, researchers and guest professors, skilled workers (earning minimal annual income of 33. 082 euro), managers and CEOs of multinationals (earning minimal annual income of 55. 193 euro), tourists and short-term business travelers.

The Chinese emigration is Europe already set off at the end of the 19 th century. However the recent wave from China needs to be contextualised in the current era of transnationalism and globalisation (Ong and Nonini 1997). Since contemporary migration is best represented and understood as a configuration of different actors and processes in the countries of origin, transit and destination, attention is also paid to the European dimension. Migration is a powerful force in the imagination of the Chinese as an individual and as a community. Migration stands for a channel for improvement of the livelihood of the family. When Chinese migrants are intercepted, they do not loose heart. On the contrary interceptions and imprisonment are obstacles in the migration project and trajectory. It is a conscious act, in which the family as a group is involved. The migrants see themselves not as victims but as actors, who deliberatley opt for migration as an instrument of social mobility. For some family, it is a survival strategy, for others it means an accelerated means of gaining more respect in the country of origin Among the Chinese newcomers, there is the ever-growing number of Chinese students and researchers. They will contribute to a more diversified image of the Chinese community in Europe. A similar trend is noticeable in business travel by Chinese. Those, who enter through family reunification, are at the current moment negligeable. The major bulk enters the country as illegal economic migrant. Generally these migrants rely on criminal networks for organising the journey. Given the restrictive immigration regime within the Schengen area, migrants travel in different steps, with stops in the newly emerged migration hubs such as Moscou, Prague, Kiev but also Istanbul and other major cities at the periphery, bordering 'Fortress Europe'. Concerning the forecasts, there are few indications that the migration movement will dry up. On the contrary it is very likely that the current trend will be sustained if not accelerated as the direct result of economic growth, more access to information, etc. in China. Thus, the diversification of the Chinese in Europe will be continued and reinforced consisting of skilled as well as unskilled migrants. Even when the current immigration policies in Europe do not change, there will be still a growing number Chinese entering as illegal economic migrants, students and researchers, highly skilled workers and probably also family reunification with the economic expansion of China.
