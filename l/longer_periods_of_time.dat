5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled carbon {{in the world}} and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, {{the end of the}} 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|The electron's {{charge was}} more {{carefully}} {{measured by the}} American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling {{as a result of}} gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over {{hundreds or thousands of}} years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses {{the question of}} why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} eutrophication decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the major community shifts that can occur in sporocarp responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae respond in a considerably subtler manner in the short term. However, over <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> eutrophication can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E
