5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the <b>lower</b> <b>limit,</b> at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the planet's mass can be obtained. This <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E

The nuclide 54Fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.|$|E

Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> of RDII amplitudes are the mean[*]±[*]standard deviation of all calculated RDII amplitudes.

5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass {{is likely to be}} close to the measured minimum mass.|$|E

25|$|One dogma of {{intertidal}} ecology—supported by such classic studies—is that species' <b>lower</b> tide height <b>limits</b> are set by species interactions whereas their upper {{limits are}} set by climate variables. Classic studies by Robert Paine established that when sea star predators are removed, mussel beds extend to lower tide heights, smothering resident seaweeds. Thus, mussels' <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> are set by sea star predation. Conversely, {{in the presence}} of sea stars, mussels' <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> occur at a tide height at which sea stars are unable to tolerate climate conditions.|$|R
5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital inclination to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this <b>lower</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

The s2p configuration was expected to be more volatile than the s2d configuration, and be more {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered. The discoveries {{of these two}} orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet/brown dwarf-to-star mass ratios (below 0.01) orbiting {{at a distance of}} hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2.2% of all stars. However, this number is a <b>lower</b> <b>limit,</b> as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E

The algorithm first performs the local maxima detection using MatLab’s max function on every 100 data points {{for a total of}} 2, 000 data points or 20 local maxima. The mean[*]±[*]standard deviation of this list of local maxima is then calculated, and any local maxima in this list not within those limits are considered noise and removed from further analysis. The R peak upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> are then calculated as the mean[*]±[*]standard deviation of the final list of the first local maxima.|$|R

5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E
