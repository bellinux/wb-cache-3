The master thesis deals with developing a computer program that generates basic parameters of tension <b>leveling</b> <b>line.</b> The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes the types of the shape imperfections in strips, their causes and the principles of their elimination. This part also presents the mechanism of tension leveling and describes the present-day design of tension levelers. The practical part of the thesis starts with an analytical description of stress-strain behaviour of strip during tension leveling (supposing the simplified conditions).

40|$|We study five high {{precision}} <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> located around the epicentral area of 13 January 1915, Mw = 6. 7 Fucino earthquake (Italy), that possibly recorded late stage postseismic relaxation movements. The geodetic signal {{is expected to}} comprise both large-scale uplift of the Apennines and postseismic relaxation effects. In order to verify this hypothesis and to estimate the amount of each contribution, we compute gravitational visco-elastic postseismic relaxation by inverting leveling data. Results indicate that the elastic upper crust is relatively thin (about 10 km) and post-seismic contribution could be set at 30 % of the geodetic signal. Model parameters are consistent with previous knowledge of the 1915 Fucino earthquake source, local seismic hypocentral determinations and crustal models derived from surface waves...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} coseismic and postseismic {{displacements}} related with the 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake sequence {{by means of}} <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> along a deformed aqueduct located in the epicentral area. Comparing the 1960 and 10 / 1997 measurements we obtain 0. 49  0. 10 m of coseismic displacement distributed along 3 km across the normal fault zone. Modeling of the coseismic surface dislocation is obtained {{from a combination of}} low angle (38 °) faults at depth and high angle (80 °) upper fault branches. The best fit model indicates that the upper branches stop at 0. 4 km below the ground surface and have 60 % of slip with respect to the lower faults. The postseismic displacement measured during 1998 is 0. 18 m and represents 36 % of the apparent coseismic deformation. Moderate earthquakes in the Apennines and related surface deformation may thus result from curved faults that reflect the brittle-elastic properties of the uppermost crustal structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{catchment}} located {{south of}} the Venice Lagoon experienced during the last century a general land settlement owing to groundwater pumping, oxidation of organically rich soils enhanced by agricultural activities, and natural sediment compaction. High land subsidence rates (2 - 4 cm/year) have been estimated in the area comprised between the lagoon edge and the Adige River and located between two <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> of the Italian national network (IGM lines n 7 and n 19). Only a partial knowledge {{on the behavior of}} land elevation is available in this region. To overcome this lack of information, a new fine leveling and GPS network has been established in the area within the ISES Project funded by National/Local water and administrative Authorities. The first field measurement carried out in 1999 have produced as a major result an accurate knowledge of the geoid height {{in this part of the}} Po River plain and has pointed out the stability of the area located along the lagoon boundaries during the six-year period from 1993 to now...|$|R

We calculated the expected 1997 coseismic {{elevation changes}} along the line using standard dislocation modeling and found that their trend has an amplitude three {{times larger than the}} trend of the observed pre- 1997 signal but with a similar shape. We suggest that this signal is the result of 10 cm of pre- 1992 slip along the northernmost 5 km of the 1997 earthquake fault, where coseismic slip was found to be less than the average estimated for the entire fault. This result implies unusually fast slip along this section of the fault and may suggest slip acceleration in preparation for the impending failure...|$|E
40|$|Several {{important}} geological {{structures in}} the western Slovenia were identified as active and their activity was quantified. Geologic interpretation {{is based on the}} analysis of repeated <b>leveling</b> <b>line</b> campaigns data along the Sečovlje–Bled polygon. Taking into account the limitations of the method – only the vertical component of displacement is measured – the following structures were identified as active: a juvenile syncline between Strunjan and Koper, the Kras Imbricate Structure, the Divača fault, the Raša fault, the Southalpine Front and the Julian Alps thrust. Vertical movement rate is relative, calculated with respect to the benchmark in Sečovlje. The largest uplift rate difference between Sečovlje and Bled is 7 mm/a.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of repeated high precision leveling observations {{during the last}} 40 years along lines of the Italian fundamental network allowed us to estimate very recent vertical movements in eastern Sicily and southern Calabria (Italy). The network {{is measured by the}} Italian Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM) and we have analyzed three <b>leveling</b> <b>lines.</b> Because of the lack of an absolute reference datum, we have conducted the analyses in terms of relative elevation changes compared to reference benchmarks. Although the processing of the different time series obtained from the high precision leveling has allowed us to estimate only relative rates, their extreme accuracy, together with the large extension of networks, makes this type of measurement fundamental for the estimate of recent vertical deformation. In addition, correlating instrumental and geological data makes it possible to identify active tectonic structures whose elastic strain accumulation could be responsible for vertical deformation. In particular, vertical motion can be related to the activity of a W-E trending fault separating the Catania Plain from the Hyblean Plateau in southeastern Sicily, a N-S trending normal fault occurring north of the Messina town and the NE-SW trending Scilla normal fault in south-western Calabria. The last two are located {{on the sides of the}} Messina Straits, an area of broad interest for the planning of the single-span bridge between Sicily and mainland Italy...|$|R
40|$|Most aspects {{related to}} the {{horizontal}} component of the Geocentric Reference System for the Americas (SIRGAS) have been solved. However, {{in the case of}} the vertical component there are still aspects of definition, national realizations and continental unification still not accomplished. Chile is no exception; due to its particular geographic characteristics, a number of tide gauges (TG) had to be installed in the coast from which the <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> that compose the Chilean Vertical Network (CHVN) were established. This study explored the offsets of the CHVN by two different approaches; one geodetic and one oceanographic. In the first approach, the offsets were obtained in relation to the following Global Geopotential Models (GGM) : the satellite-only model (unbiased) GO_CONS_gcf_ 2 _tim_r 3 derived from GOCE satellite mission; EGM 2008 (combined-biased); and GOEGM 08, combining information from the GO_CONS_gcf_ 2 _tim_r 3 in long wavelengths (n max~ 200) with the mean/short wavelengths of EGM 2008 (n> 200). In the oceanographic method, we used the CNES CLS 2011 Global Mean Sea surface and EIGEN_GRACE_ 5 C GGM to obtain the values of MDT at the different TG. We also evaluated the CHVN in relation to different GGMs. The results showed consistency between the values obtained by the two methods at the TG of Valparaíso and Puerto Chacabuco.

30|$|At polar latitudes, this SH {{along-track}} {{analysis is}} also imperfect. The data selection process minimizes the ionosphere diurnal variations but cannot avoid all ionospheric field contributions. In particular, the field {{produced by the}} polar electrojets persists at night times. It is confined within the auroral oval (between 55 ° and 75 ° absolute latitude) during magnetically quiet times, and along-track correction with low SH degree models is not as efficient. Maus et al. (2008) propose an additional <b>line</b> <b>leveling</b> procedure that consists in minimizing the differences at crossover points between satellite tracks. The leveling is effective for mapping the lithospheric field. However, the corresponding inverse problem is ill-posed because one can always add a constant to the satellite tracks without affecting {{the difference between the}} tracks (Menke 2012). Setting this constant value a priori is challenging, and an erroneous value can lead to a lithospheric field model with a biased offset. For this reason, we do not apply the <b>line</b> <b>leveling</b> procedure for the present model.|$|R
40|$|Volcanic {{risk in the}} {{explosive}} Campi Flegrei (CF) caldera is extremely high, because of its location in a densely populated area about 15 km west of Naples inside the Campanian Plain. CF is renowned as a site of continual slow vertical movements. Since the last eruption in 1538, the caldera generally subsided until 1969 then uplift {{began in the early}} 1970 s (about 1. 5 m max), a further large uplift episode occurred from 1982 to 1984 (about 1. 8 m max), and a few smaller uplift episodes occurred in 1989, 1994, 2000, and 2006. From 2006, CF is mostly uplifting. Ground deformation monitoring of CF started in 1905, when the Istituto Geografico Militare established a first <b>leveling</b> <b>line</b> from Naples to Serapeum; since then the <b>leveling</b> <b>line</b> has been much extended and now the leveling network consists of 350 altimetric benchmarks. Geodetic precise-traversing surveys-distance (EDM) and angular measurements were carried out from time to time, starting from June 1970. A Continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) network began operating {{at the end of the}} 1990 s. Ground displacement data from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry are available since 1992. Such an abundance of data has allowed detailed studies of the ground deformation time history. In particular, we have recently found that CF ground deformation, within data uncertainties, is always given by the sum of two "stationary contributions" at least since 1980. Large-scale deformation can be explained by a quasi-horizontal source, oriented NW/SE and mathematically represented by a pressurized finite thin triaxial ellipsoid (PTE) embedded in a layered medium at about 4 km; residual deformation not accounted for by PTE can be mathematically explained by a small (point) pressurized oblate spheroid about 2 km below the Solfatara fumarolic field. The location and geometry of the two sources are constant with the exception of volume changes (potency); potency time histories are somewhat similar but not identical. A long-standing controversy characterizes the interpretation of CF inflation and deflation phases, which are generally ascribed to fluid injections at the basis of the hydrothermal system or to shallow magma injections. As a matter of fact, all published models of both processes predict complex spatial and/or temporal patterns of CF ground deformation. We will give a review of our knowledge about CF ground deformation and present a new model of magma intrusion, which is consistent with the observed constancy of the ground deformation pattern...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} ’ 70 s {{vertical}} ground movements at Mount Vesuvius area {{have been investigated}} and monitored by the Osservatorio Vesuviano (Isti-tuto Nazionale di Geofisica Vulcanologia - Osservatorio Vesuviano since 2001).

The deformation pattern and expected strain field assessment methods in the volcanic structure induced by inner sources has demanded in subsequent years {{the expansion of the}} leveling network up to cover the whole volcanic area, enclosing part of leveling lines of other institutions. As a result of this expansion, the Mt. Vesuvius Area Leveling Network (VALN) has today reached a length of about 270 km and consists of 359 benchmarks. It is configured in 21 circuits and is connected, westward, to the Campi Flegrei leveling network and, northward, to the Campania Plain leveling network. The data collected have been carefully re-analyzed for random and systematic errors and for error propagation along the leveling lines to identify the areas affected by significant ground movements.

Height difference between the lowest and the highest point is 497, 98692 meters. Whole classical geodesy is based on point and the third coordinate of point is height.

Which height system is better to choose and what advantages or disadvantages has one height system, was common thread of my diploma work. We have determined heights of the chosen levelling line in different height systems in the test area. These are: normal orthometric heights, geopotential number, dynamic heights, orthometric heights and normal heights. The official height system in Slovenia are normal orthometric heights. The official height system in many European countries are normal heights and this height system would be most appropriate and useful for Slovenia too. Normal heights satisfy all five basic conditions for ideal height system. Normal heights are also very good connected with ellipsoidal heights...|$|E

40|$|The 1915 Fucino {{earthquake}} (Ms= 6. 9) {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most destructive events in Italy during the last century. The epicentral area is centered in the Abruzzi region (Central Italy), where a long historical record of large earthquakes is available. Seismotectonic studies on this region, based on instrumental seismicity (focal mechanism solutions of major events and stress analysis of background seismicity), borehole break-out studies and several geological and paleoseismological investigations, suggest NE-SW oriented active extension. The 1915 earthquake fault produced detectable surface ruptures for about 20 km along NW-SE striking SW-dipping structures. Coseismic geodetic data recorded in the epicentral area have been inverted in the past (Amoruso et al. 1998 and references therein), indicating a source fault dipping at moderate angle toward SW and a normal focal mechanism, with a non-negligible left-lateral component. Three high precision leveling lines located in a wide sector north and east of the Fucino plain were measured in 1950 and 1997 - 2000 by the IGM (Istituto Geografico Militare). Two consecutive lines run in a NW-SE direction along the chain, and form a "T-shape" net together with a third line SW-NE striking, towards the Adriatic sea. The total length is about 360 km with a mean benchmark density higher than 0. 5 bm/km. The relative elevation changes recorded during this time interval show maximum values between 7 and 12 cm with a signal wavelength of 40 - 70 km. The observed elevation changes stand significantly above the calculated total error of 1. 13 mm sqrt(L) km. A sharp gradient has been observed east of the earthquake epicenter, where we observe peculiar elevation changes along a 40 km long section of the <b>leveling</b> <b>line.</b> The observed elevation changes in Fucino earthquake area seem to comprise both regional tectonic deformation and post-seismic relaxation. The former and the latter effects are expected to dominate along sections of the leveling lines which are respectively about perpendicular and parallel to the Apennines. Since we compare measurements performed in 1950 and 1997 - 2000, relaxation effects refer to a late stage of the process. We have used Pollitz (1997) code for computing gravitational-viscoelastic postseismic relaxation on a layered spherical Earth. Different Earth models, characterized by different thicknesses and viscosities of crustal layers and of the upper mantle, have been considered. Even if S/N ratio of expected post-seismic effects is not high, comparison between predictions and observations allows to constrain regional crustal structure. Best-fit seismic moment is in good agreement with Amoruso et al. (1998) and residuals are fully consistent with expected regional tectonic deformation in central Apennines...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} rupture {{model of the}} Northridge earthquake, {{determined}} from the joint inversion of near-source strong ground motion recordings, P and SH teleseismic body waves, Global Positioning System (GPS) displacement vectors, and permanent uplift measured along <b>leveling</b> <b>lines.</b> The fault is defined to strike 122 ° and dip 40 ° to the south-southwest. The average rake vector is determined to be 101 °, and average slip is 1. 3 m; the peak slip reaches about 3 m. Our estimate of the seismic moment is 1. 3 ± 0. 2 × 10 ^(26) dyne-cm (potency of 0. 4 km 3). The rupture area is small relative to the overall aftershock dimensions and is approximately 15 km along strike, nearly 20 km in the dip direction, {{and there is no}} indication of slip shallower than about 5 to 6 km. The up-dip, strong-motion velocity waveforms are dominated by large S-wave pulses attributed to source directivity and are comprised of at least 2 to 3 distinct arrivals (a few seconds apart). Stations at southern azimuths indicate two main S-wave arrivals separated longer in time (about 4 to 5 sec). These observations are best modeled with a complex distribution of subevents: The initial S-wave arrival comes from an asperity that begins at the hypocenter and extends up-dip and to the north where a second, larger subevent is centered (about 12 km away). The secondary S arrivals at southern azimuths are best fit with additional energy radiation from another high slip region at a depth of 19 km, 8 km west of the hypocenter. The resolving power of the individual data sets is examined by predicting the geodetic (GPS and leveling) displacements with the dislocation model determined from the waveform data, and vice versa, and also by analyzing how well the teleseismic solution predicts the recorded strong motions. The general features of the geodetic displacements are not well predicted from the model determined independently from the strong-motion data; likewise, the slip model determined from geodetic data does not adequately reproduce the strong-motion characteristics. Whereas a particularly smooth slip pattern is sufficient to satisfy the geodetic data, the strong-motion and teleseismic data require a more heterogeneous slip distribution in order to reproduce the velocity amplitudes and frequency content. Although the teleseismic model can adequately reproduce the overall amplitude and frequency content of the strong-motion velocity recordings, it does a poor job of predicting the geodetic data. Consequently, a robust representation of the slip history and heterogeneity requires a combined analysis of these data sets...|$|R

40|$|The Montello–Conegliano Thrust is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} structure of the Southern Alpine fault belt in the Veneto-Friuli plain, {{as a result of}} the conspicuous morphological evidence of the Montello anticline, which is associated to uplifted and deformed river terraces, diversion of the course of the Piave River, as well as vertical relative motions registered by <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> (Galadini et al., 2005; Burrato et al., 2008). Many papers dealt with its geometry and evolution, and the presence of several orders of Middle and Upper Pleistocene warped river terraces (Benedetti et al., 2000) in the western sector strongly suggests that the Montello–Conegliano anticline is active and driven by the underlying thrust. However, in spite of the spectacular geomorphic and geologic evidence of activity of the Montello-Conegliano Thrust, there is only little evidence on how much contractional strain is released through discrete events (i. e. earthquakes) and how much goes aseismic. Benedetti et al. (2000) hypothesized that the western part of the thrust (Montello) may have slipped three times in the past 2000 years (during the Mw 5. 8 778 A. D., Mw 5. 4 1268 and Mw 5. 0 1859 earthquakes), yielding a mean recurrence time of about 500 years, whereas, the eastern part of the thrust (Conegliano) would be silent. The Italian seismic catalogues have very poor-quality and incomplete data for these events associated with the Montello thrust, leaving room for different interpretations, as for example the possibility that these earthquakes were generated by nearby secondary structures. In this latter case, the whole Montello–Conegliano Thrust would represent a major “silent” structure, with a recurrence interval longer than 700 years, because none of the historical earthquakes reported in the Italian Catalogues of seismicity for the past seven centuries can be convincingly referred to the Montello Source. Given the uncertainties regarding the seismic potential of this segment of the Southern Alpine fault system, we designed and realized a new GPS network across the Montello region (Fig. 1), with the goal of detecting the present-day velocity gradient pattern and develop models of the inter-seismic deformation (i. e., geometry, kinematics and coupling of the seismogenic fault). In the 2009, we started realizing a new concept of GPS experiment, called “semi-continuous”. As the name suggests, the method involves moving a set of GPS receivers around a permanently installed network of monuments, such that each station is observed some fraction of the time. In practice, a set of GPS receivers can literally remain in the field for their entire life span, thus maximizing their usage. The monuments are designed with special mounts so that the GPS antenna is forced to the same physical location at each site. This has the advantage of mitigating errors (including possible blunders) in measuring the antenna height and in centering the antenna horizontally. This also has the advantage of reducing variation in multipath bias from one occupation session to another. The period of each “session” depends on the design of the operations. At one extreme, some stations might act essentially as permanent stations (though the equipment is still highly mobile), thus providing a level of reference frame stability, and some stations may only be occupied every year or two, in order to extend or increase the density of a network’s spatial coverage. In this work we will present the motivations and tools used to develop and implement the new GPS network. During the 2010 we will integrate the existing GPS network with 10 mobile seismic stations, belonging to the INGV mobile network, with the goal of illuminate local micro-seismicity patterns that would help constraining the locked fault geometry...|$|R

The most recent International Geomagnetic Reference Field models {{available at the time}} of the surveys were used to estimate the core field component (these models were revised later). External fields were estimated from magnetic observatory data. However, most of the measurements were not corrected for the external fields. Here we use comprehensive models to properly remove the core and external magnetic fields from all original TF measurements stored in the GEODAS. Besides, a track-by-track analysis of each data is necessary mainly to correct or to remove many shifted values as well as to reduce the noise in some track lines. Two additional processes are applied to obtain a data set coherent over the world. It includes an adjustment of long-wavelength magnetic anomalies using the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) - 720 model, plus a <b>line</b> <b>leveling</b> method which mainly reduced some inconsistencies between different surveys. The root mean square of the crossover differences was reduced from 179. 6 to 35. 9 nT. Comparisons of magnetic anomaly maps before and after our treatment also highlight an improvement in the quality and the coherence of the data set. This study will serve to build a new World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map...|$|R

Nous utilisons les réseaux géodésiques anciens combinés aux études de tectonique active et analyse de la sismicité pour mieux comprendre : i - les {{processus}} de déformation (pré-sismique, co-sismique, post-sismique et inter-sismique), et ii - les déformations à grande échelle. Une comparaison des déformations à court terme et à long terme nous {{permet de}} contraindre les caractéristiques géométriques et de comportement des failles actives des Apennins. L‘analyse et la modélisation des déformations de surface par le biais de l’InSAR mettent en évidence le caractère actif de plusieurs failles « cachée » ou « aveugle » de la péninsule italienne. Ces cas d’étude nous permettent une évaluation réaliste de l’aléa sismique en Italie. Plusieurs de nos publications dans des revues internationales (de rang A) étayent nos observations, mesures et analyses. {{process for the}} identification of active faults {{and in particular the}} direct estimation of their seismogenic potential in Italy is still marked by uncertainties. However, during the past twenty years, new models and methods have been developed to identify possible sources of large earthquakes. Approaches involving trenching of recent (Holocene) fault scarps, near-fault geomorphology and geological detailed mapping of fault zones are commonly applied. In parallel, new efforts have been made for a better understanding of Pleistocene regional geomorphology and for the improvement of analytical modeling of large scale landscape features. Despite the important step ahead recently accomplished, several historical earthquakes still do not have a causative structure associated, and for several faults, expected to be active, the seismic behavior was not evaluated on the basis of direct studies. Many of the seismogenic faults that produced an earthquake in recent times resulted to be hidden or blind, and the investigation of their characteristics was possible only by using an indirect approach and/or thanks to a very detailed field work. On the other hand, it is widely reported that regional uplift has to be considered as a first order dynamic mechanism of the Apennines mountain chain (a thrust and fold belt, NE verging, formed in early Neogene {{as a consequence of the}} collision of the Adriatic microplate and the European continental margin). In fact, during the Quaternary, the Apennines experienced important extensional tectonics and volcanism, after the compressional movements that are still active along the external front, toward the Adriatic sea. This extension is active mainly along the axial ridge of the Apennines, as testified by a number of roughly NW-SE striking crustal normal faults, responsible for historical earthquakes up to M= 7. 0 - 7. 2. Estimates of vertical motion are mainly derived from geological and geomorphological data, even if we have to admit that this evaluation is not always supported by well constrained data. Anyway, the available data suggest an average large scale uplift rate of about 1 mm/yr, for the Middle-Upper Pleistocene time interval. Unfortunately, present day geodetic estimates of the vertical component of movement are still lacking, while recent GPS solutions clearly indicate that the Apennines are characterized by NE-SW active extension within the range, with horizontal rate of extension of about 2 to 5 mm/yr. It is generally accepted that active tectonic studies have a better probability of success by using a multidisciplinary approach. In fact, modern scientific methodologies in geophysics, specifically those aimed to the identification and characterization of seismogenic structures, are often characterized by a combination of data derived from geology, geodesy, seismology and modeling. Even if an important and fundamental contribution to the understanding of the seismic cycle comes from seismological studies, it is nowadays generally accepted that the best observational bases for physical models of the earthquake deformation cycle are the geodetic data and the geological displacement rate records. In this thesis we made a new effort to analyse and interpret a large amount of geodetic leveling data available in Italy. Main objectives of this work are a) understanding of the seimic deformation process and in particular of an intriguing short (100 yr long) part of the seismic cycle (preseismic, coseismic and postseimic evidence) related to faults activated during the past century, b) defining the Apennines large scale deformation, c) comparing the short-and long-term datasets, and finally, building up a robust estimate of the geometrical and behavioral characteristics of active faulting in the Apennines. Preseismic section : Looking at the aseismic deformation recorded by leveling data crossing the Colfiorito and Amatrice faults (central Apennines) we detected an unusually fast slip along these structures (a minimum slip rate of 2 - 3 mm/yr was calculated). In the case of the Colfiorito fault, responsible for the 26 September 1997 Mw= 6. 0 earthquake, such slip was interpreted as pre-seismic slip, suggesting slip acceleration in preparation for the impending rupture (De Martini and Valensise, 1999). For the Amatrice fault a similar interpretation can be proposed but, lacking the relative seismic event, it simply remains a working hypothesis. Coseismic section : in terms of coseismic deformation this thesis presents different approaches involving both leveling and geological data, plus a preliminary InSAR-Leveling data combined analysis. The study area is represented by the epicentral region of the September 1997 -April 1998 Umbria-Marche seismic sequence, characterized by seven M> 5 earthquakes. The main results, obtained by working on the leveling data, are related to the geometry of the 26 September 1997 09 : 40 Mw= 6. 0 earthquake causative fault (specifically to the fact that it was a blind coseismic rupture) and to the variability of the coseismic slip (De Martini et al., 2003). This slip pattern suggests the presence of a major and stronger asperity in the central–southern portion of the rupture, which might result from an important rheological heterogeneity along the fault plane. Moreover, preliminary results of the combined analysis of InSAR and leveling data suggest the possible presence of a small (4 - 5 km long) fault splay above the main seismogenic fault responsible for the 26 September 1997 09 : 40 event. From the geological point of view, the analyses of the trenches dug across the surface ruptures produced by the 14 October 1997 demonstrated that these ruptures are related to the activity of a fault and that other ruptures occurred in the past with similar characteristics both in term of magnitude and geometry (Pantosti et al., 1999). In this sense, the 14 October 1997 Mw= 5. 6 earthquake could represent the “characteristic earthquake” or maximum expected event for this seismogenic fault. Notably the slip per event paleoseismological estimates are in good agreement with the average slip values derived from seismological and InSAR data. Postseismic section : the post-seismic deformation case is based on the elevation changes observed between 1950 and 2000 along the <b>leveling</b> <b>lines</b> around the epicentral area of the 1915 Ms= 6. 9 Fucino earthquake (central Italy). Relaxation effects refer to a late stage of the process (probably a unique case study worldwide) and the calculations were done varying the elastic characteristics of the crust and its stratification pattern. The best fit solutions, accounting for only about 30...|$|R
