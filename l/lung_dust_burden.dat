Objectives: Lung autopsy specimens from consecutive coroner’s cases of Hispanic males in Fresno County, California, (n = 112) were obtained to determine whether mineral dust exposure in agricultural work leads to pneumoconiosis. Met h o d s: The left lung was fixed by inflation. We evaluated airway and parenchymal pathology using standardized diagnostic criteria and semiquantitative grading schemata, including the grading of small airways for fibrosis and birefringent mineral dust particles.

40|$|Rationale: Previous {{studies have}} shown {{associations}} between dust exposure or lung burden and emphysema in coal miners, although the separate contributions of various predictors have not been clearly demonstrated. Objectives: To quantitatively evaluate the relationship between cumulative exposure to respirable coal mine dust, cigarette smoking, and other factors on emphysema severity. Methods: The study group included 722 autopsied coal miners and nonminers in the United States. Data on work history, smoking, race, and age at death were obtained from medical records and questionnaire completed by next-of-kin. Emphysema was classified and graded using a standardized schema. Job-specific mean concentrations of respirable coal mine dust were matched with work histories to estimate cumulative exposure. Relationships between various metrics of dust exposure (including cumulative exposure and <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> <b>burden)</b> and emphysema severity were investigated in weighted least squares regression models. Measurements and Main Results: Emphysema severity was significantly elevated in coal miners compared with nonminers among ever- and never-smokers (P, 0. 0001). Cumulative exposure to respirable coal mine dust or coal dust retained in the lungs were significant predictors of emphysema severity (P, 0. 0001) after accounting for cigarette smoking, age at death, and race. The contributions of coal mine dust exposure and cigarette smoking were similar in predicting emphysema severity averaged over this cohort. Conclusions: Coal dust exposure, cigarette smoking, age, and race are significant and additive predictors of emphysema severity in this study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Some years ago, {{during a}} {{systematic}} {{investigation of the}} lungs of miners from all the major British coalfields, {{it was found that}} <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> from Scotland did not fit in with the expected pattern, which was that the <b>dust</b> in the <b>lungs</b> would consist largely of the appropriate seam coal and associated minerals. Further study showed that nearly all the Scottish <b>lung</b> <b>dusts</b> had properties similar to those of soot. It was concluded that most of the pneumoconiosis found in Scottish coalminers could have been caused by soot from naked-light illumination, i. e. open lamps or candles, and that with the changeover to electric lighting, one possible cause of pneumoconiosis has been eliminated from the pits.

40|$|Objectives This {{study has}} {{researched}} {{the significance of}} histologically raised findings and <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses {{in the context of}} claiming the recognition of and thus compensation for an asbestos-associated occupational disease. Material and Methods For this approach, all findings from the German Mesothelioma Register in 2015 that included <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses were evaluated and were compared with information on asbestos fiber exposure at work based on fiber years, and with the results of radiological findings. Results For 68 insured persons, recognition of an asbestos-induced lung disease according to Section 4104 of the German Ordinance on Occupational Diseases (Berufskrankheitenverordnung – BKV) could be recommended {{solely on the basis of}} the histological examinations of lung tissues and complementary <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses. Neither did the calculation of the cumulative asbestos dust exposure at work yield 25 fiber years, nor could bridge findings (e. g., plaques) be identified. In addition, the autopsies of 12 patients revealed plaques that had not been diagnosed during radiological examinations. These results show that – irrespective of the prescribed working techniques and radiological diagnosis – pathological/anatomical and histological diagnostics are often the only way for the insureds to demonstrate the causal connection between asbestos and their disease. Even after long intervals of up to 40 years post last exposure, the asbestos fibers would still be easily detectable in the lung tissues evaluated. Conclusions Whenever suitable tissue is available, it should be examined for mild asbestosis with the aid of a <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis.

In the context of health insurance, the <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis and the resulting proof of the presence of asbestosis often constitute one option of providing evidence of an occupational disease.

The highest mean dust concentrations (about 20 %) were found in nodules and massive fibrosis. Overall {{there were no significant}} differences between the selected lesion types and their respective whole <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> composition, although the central sites of massive fibrosis were found to contain on average a higher proportion of coal and a lower proportion of ash and its measured constituents, quartz and kaolin plus mica, than the edge of the lesion (p less than 0. 001 for each component). There were striking differences between recovered lung and lymph node dusts. An examination of 180 specimens showed a mean quartz in lymph node dust of 20. 3 % compared with 6. 1 % in <b>lung</b> <b>dust.</b> As expected the proportion of quartz was greater in lymph nodes and lungs from men who had worked "low" rank (high ash) coal.

40|$|For {{absorbing}} aerosols like soil (or "mineral'') dust, {{radiative forcing}} {{at the surface}} differs substantially from the value {{at the top of}} the atmosphere (TOA). The climate response depends not only upon the TOA forcing, but its difference with respect to the surface value, which represents radiative heating within the atmosphere. Surface forcing alters evaporation and the hydrologic cycle, which feeds back upon the aerosol burden through the efficiency of wet deposition. We calculate the surface forcing by soil dust aerosols and its global sensitivity by varying aspects of the dust distribution that are poorly constrained by observations. Ignorance of the global <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> corresponds to a forcing uncertainty of over a factor of two, with smaller uncertainties due to imprecise knowledge of particle optical properties and the particle size distribution. While global evaporation and precipitation are reduced in response to surface radiative forcing by dust, precipitation increases locally over desert regions, so that dust emission can act as a negative feedback to desertification. The effect of the global reduction in precipitation is to lengthen the particle lifetime by reducing the efficiency of wet deposition, representing a positive feedback upon the global <b>dust</b> <b>burden.</b> For the current climate, we calculate the reduction in wet deposition by dust radiative forcing and find that the aerosol burden is increased only modestly. However, the global <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> and associated radiative forcing are substantially higher during glacial climates, so that the amplification of the dust load by this feedback is larger. By extrapolating from its radiative forcing in the current climate, we estimate that dust reduces precipitation during glacial times by as much as half the reduction due to the colder climate alone.

We found that for dusty days the coarse mode mass extinction efficiency decreases from 0. 62 to 0. 48 m 2 g − 1 as NH 3 burden increases from 0 to 40 mg m − 2. The fine mode extinction efficiency, ranging from 4 to 16 m 2 g − 1, does not appear to depend on NH 3 concentration or relative humidity but rather on mineralogical composition and mixing with other aerosols.

40|$|To date, the {{radiative}} {{impact of}} dust and the Sahar an air layer (SAL) on North Atlantic hurricane activity is not yet known. According to previous studies, dust stabilizes the atmosphere due to absorption of solar radiation but thus shifts convection to regions more conducive for hurricane genesis. Here we analyze differences in hurricane genesis and frequency from ensemble sensitivity simulations with radiatively active and inactive dust in the aerosol-climate model ECHAM 6 -HAM. We investigate <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> and other hurricane-related variables and determine their influence on disturbances which develop into hurricanes (developing disturbances, DDs) and those which do not (nondeveloping disturbances, NDDs). Dust and the SAL are found to potentially have both inhibiting and supporting influences on background conditions for hurricane genesis.

The men were divided into three groups depending on the presence of particular lesions in their lungs. Lungs containing no fibrotic lesions in excess of 1 mm were included in the "M" group, those with fibrotic lesions of between 1 mm and 9 mm in diameter were included in the "F" group, and those with any lesion 10 mm or more were categorised as having progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). The men were further divided into four groups according to the rank of coal mined at the colliery of employment. The mean weight of <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> increased over the pathological range (M [...] F [...] PMF) regardless of the rank of coal mined. The men with PMF had not received unusually high exposures to dust in life but were found to have accumulated more <b>dust</b> in their <b>lungs</b> per unit of dust exposure than men without PMF, providing further evidence for differences in the patterns of deposition or clearance, or both, of dust in these men compared with those who do not develop PMF. For men who had mined the higher rank coals {{there was no difference in}} the composition of the <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> between the pathological groups.

In men who had mined low rank coal the proportion of ash in the airborne dust to which they had been exposed and in the dust retained in their lungs was, as expected, greater than in men who had worked with higher rank coals. For the same men, and particularly associated with the presence of some dust related fibrosis, the proportion of ash in retained dust was higher than that in the dust to which the men were exposed suggesting the occurrence of selective deposition or retention of the mineral components of dust in this group...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMineral dust {{aerosols}} play {{an important}} role in the climate system. Coupled climate-aerosol models are an important tool with which to quantify dust fluxes and the associated climate impact. Over the last decade or more, numerous models have been developed, both global and regional, but to date, there have been few attempts to compare the performance of these models. In this paper a comparison of five regional atmospheric models with dust modules is made, in terms of their simulation of meteorology, dust emission and transport. The intercomparison focuses on a 3 -day dust event over the Bodélé depression in northern Chad, the world's single most important dust source. Simulations are compared to satellite data and in situ observations from the Bodélé Dust Experiment (BoDEx 2005). Overall, the models reproduce many of the key features of the meteorology and the large dust plumes that occur over the study domain. However, there is at least an order of magnitude range in model estimates of key quantities including <b>dust</b> concentration, <b>dust</b> <b>burden,</b> <b>dust</b> flux, and aerosol optical thickness. As such, there remains considerable uncertainty in model estimates of the dust cycle and its interaction with climate.

40|$|The use of ferrimagnetic {{material}} as a tracer represents a noninvasive approach in physiological measurements. Concerning the lung, magnetopneumography, MPG, {{is a unique}} technique to estimate retained <b>dust</b> in the <b>lung,</b> using the magnetizable dust fraction as a tracer. First a strong constant magnetic field is briefly applied to the thorax. After the field has been removed, the weak remanent field of the magnetized particles is measured outside the body. The sampled data include information {{not only about the}} amount and distribution, but also about the random rotation, of the tracer- particles. In the present work, the MPG method was used in vivo, and developed through model studies toward improved accuracy. Furthermore, applications of the MPG principle (and instrument) in the field of gastrointestinal motility were developed and evaluated. Such applications may constitute future alternatives to clinically established radiological methods, especially for subjects for whom radiation is of particular concern. Previous investigations have shown large inter-individual variations of <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> retention among arc welders with similar fume exposure history. Here, repeated MPG measurements were used to monitor the retention build-up in a group of eight, previously unexposed, trainees during a welding course. Already after 30 days of exposure there were inter-individual differences in estimated retention of more than a factor of two. A first-order retention model was suggested, including estimated individual dust exposure profiles. The inverse problem of finding the amount and distribution of the source of a measured magnetic field has no unique solution. Anatomical differences of lung and chest shapes are important sources of error when total amounts of <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> are estimated and inter-individual variations are studied. Multipole analysis involves estimation of a number of coefficients in a truncated sum; one of these represents the total dipole moment, which is proportional to the total amount of dust. In comparison, the commonly used mean value method showed much larger bias error than the multipole methods. Multipole orders up to and including octupoles were needed to describe the field from a magnetized thorax. This model is well suited when measuring total dust load in subjects where dust translocation is of concern, e. g. in studies of human <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> clearance. Gastric emptying measurements were carried out magnetically on 16 healthy male volunteers. The early part of the mean emptying curve decreased slightly faster than the curve of a corresponding previous scintigraphic study. Rotations (due to intraluminal movements) were studied by measuring the field decay outside the abdomen after magnetization. After a low activity phase of almost linear flux density decay, the mean rotation gradually increased, and the decay became bi-exponential. Moreover, by measuring field maps repeatedly after ingestion, the transit of a swallowed small permanent magnet was followed through the gut. It is concluded that measurements of magnetic fields from ferrimagnetic tracers prove a valuable and promising tool in estimations of retained <b>dust</b> in the <b>lungs,</b> as well as in studies of gastric motility...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of climate change (CC) and anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) for the <b>dust</b> emissions and <b>burden</b> changes between the late nineteenth century and today. For this purpose, the climate-aerosol model ECHAM 6 -HAM 2 is complemented by a new scheme to derive potential dust sources at runtime using the vegetation cover provided by the land component JSBACH of ECHAM 6. Dust emissions are computed online using information from the ECHAM 6 atmospheric component. This allows us to account for changes in land cover and climate interactively and to distinguish between emissions from natural and agricultural dust sources. For today's climate we find that nearly 10 % of dust particles are emitted from agricultural areas. According to our simulations, global annual dust emissions have increased by 25 % between the late nineteenth century and today (e. g., from 729 Tg/a to 912 Tg/a). Globally, CC and ALCC (e. g., agricultural expansion) have both contributed to this change (56 % and 40 %, respectively). There are however large regional differences. For example, change in dust emissions in Africa are clearly dominated by CC. Global <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> have increased by 24. 5 % since the late nineteenth century, which results in a clear-sky radiative forcing at top of the atmosphere of similar to 0. 14 W/m(2).

Dust sources are calculated both using mean wind speeds with model resolution (T 63) and sub-grid wind speeds. Different datasets are used to describe soil erodibility. We explain how the different assumptions on dust production affect atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> and deposition. Some aspects of the annual dust cycle, such as the east Asian dust emissions are largely dependent on the data used to determine soil erodibility. Other aspects, such as the timing of the maximum in the African plume at Northern hemisphere summer is well modeled with all datasets applied here. We show that the daily variation in optical depth at Cape Verde at the west coast of Africa is well simulated when we assume that erodibility is correlated with surface reflectivity from MODIS satellite data. Using a sub-grid probability density function of wind speed to drive the dust sources facilitates dust emissions in areas with low wind speeds. Dust concentrations in remote areas are sensitive to the parameterization of wet deposition. Our results point out to need for a detailed soil erodibility dataset for global dust modeling, and they suggest that surface reflectivity is potentially valuable for producing or evaluating such datasets. 1...|$|R

Other aspects, such as the timing of the maximum in the African plume at Northern Hemisphere summer, are well modeled with all data sets applied here. We show that the daily variation in optical depth at Cape Verde on the west coast of Africa is well simulated when we assume that erodibility is correlated with surface reflectivity from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. Using a subgrid probability density function of wind speed to drive the dust sources facilitates dust emissions in areas with low wind speeds. Dust concentrations in remote areas are sensitive to the parameterization of wet deposition. Our results point out the need for a detailed soil erodibility data set for global dust modeling, and they suggest that surface reflectivity is potentially valuable for producing or evaluating such data sets...|$|R
40|$|Four {{groups of}} rats were treated by {{inhalation}} with the UICC preparations of amosite or chrysotile {{in order to}} explore the effects of intermittent high dust concentrations (peak dosing). For each of the 2 asbestos types one group of rats was treated for 5 days each week, 7 h a day, for 1 year. Two other groups were treated with amosite or chrysotile at 5 times the previous dose for 1 day each week for 1 year. Results showed that the <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> levels of both chrysotile or amosite in the lungs of rats after the 12 -month inhalation period were similar regardless of whether "peak" or "even" dosing had been used. During the following 6 months, asbestos was cleared from the "peak" chrysotile group more slowly than the "even" chrysotile group but clearance from the "peak" amosite group was faster than that found after "even" dosing with amosite. Levels of early peribronchial fibrosis were generally lower for the "peak" dosing groups than for "even" dosing although levels of interstitial fibrosis were slightly higher following "peak" dosing. The incidence of pulmonary neoplasms did not differ between the "peak"-dosing and "even"-dosing experiments. These findings therefore give no indication that short periods of high dust exposure in an asbestos factory {{would result in a}} significantly greater hazard than would be indicated by the raised overall dust counts for the day in question...|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{histories}} {{collected during}} interviews in an epidemiological study and then expressed as types {{and levels of}} occupational exposure have been compared to the results acquired in a physico-chemical analysis of the particles extracted from pulmonary parenchyma of forty-two subjects with different types of cancer. The original scenario was {{for a group of}} workers, ten exposed mainly to asbestos fibers, ten to silica, ten to welding fumes, six smokers, and six nonsmokers not exposed to the target contaminants. Fragments of tissue that had been formolated or covered in paraffin were used after having been standardized by two pathologists. The preparation and analytical protocols were validated so that a representative number of particles could be counted and "reasonably" characterized from their morphology and their chemical composition by transmission electron microscopy and laser microprobe mass analyser. A Kappa test revealed that there was a limited correlation at the 5 % level of confidence between the work history history and physico-chemical estimators for the group of subjects exposed to asbestos fiber (k = 0. 475, p = 0. 001), a 10 % level for the group with silica exposure (k = 0. 213, p = 0. 089) and at a 5 % level in the unexposed nonsmoker group (k = 0. 417, p = 0. 003). The average pulmonary <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> of the log-normalized values for certain minerals that were extracted from subjects belonging to certain groups of interest were statistically different...|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between the profusion and predominant type of small rounded opacities on chest radiographs taken within four years of death and the postmortem counts of dust lesions in four classes (macules, "pinhead" fibrotic nodules, nodules 1 - 3 mm, and nodules greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter) has been examined for 71 coalworkers without progressive massive fibrosis. The radiographs were categorised by four readers independently, according to the ILO classification. For subjects considered by each reader to present predominantly p type opacities, increasing opacity profusion was exclusively and significantly associated {{with an increase in}} the number of pinhead fibrotic nodules. Numbers of nodules measuring 1 - 3 mm and greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter both showed significant linear associations with opacity profusion category in subjects presenting predominantly q opacities, the closer association being observed with the smaller lesions. These observations held true for all readers. Opacities of type r were rarely considered to be the predominant type. For the reader who recorded the maximum number of such cases, opacity profusion was not significantly related to the numbers of dust lesions in any of the lesion classes. Nevertheless, the closest association was observed with nodules measuring greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter. An overall significant linear association between total <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> content and opacity profusion was found to be due mainly to subjects presenting predominantly p type opacities and to a lesser extent to those with predominantly q opacities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} mineral {{dust emission}} from alluvial sediments within the upland region in northern Mauritania {{in the vicinity}} of a decaying nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ). For the first time, the impact of valleys that are embedded in a rather homogeneous surrounding is investigated with regard to their role as dust source. Measures for local atmospheric <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> were retrieved from airborne observations, satellite observations, and model simulations and analyzed in order to provide complementary information at different horizontal scales. Observations by the LEANDRE Nouvelle Generation backscatter lidar system flying aboard the French Falcon 20 aircraft were taken along five parallel flight legs perpendicular to the orientation of the main valley system dominating the topography of the study area. Results from a comparison of lidar-derived extinction coefficients with topography and aerial photographs confirm the relevance of (1) alluvial sediments at the valley bottoms as a dust source, and (2) the break-down of the nocturnal LLJ as a trigger for dust emission in this region. An evaluation of the AROME regional model, forecasting dust at high resolution (5 km grid), points toward an under-representation of alluvial dust sources in this region. This is also evident from simulations by the MesoNH research model. Although MesoNH simulations show higher dust loadings than AROME, which are more comparable to the observations, both models underestimate the dust concentrations within the boundary layer compared to lidar observations. A sensitivity study on the impact of horizontal grid spacing (5 km versus 1 km) highlights the importance of spatial resolution on simulated dust loadings...|$|R
40|$|Soil dust {{is a major}} {{driver of}} ice {{nucleation}} in clouds leading to precipitation. It consists largely of mineral particles with {{a small fraction of}} organic matter constituted mainly of remains of micro-organisms that participated in degrading plant debris before their own decay. Some micro-organisms {{have been shown to be}} much better ice nuclei than the most efficient soil mineral. Yet, current aerosol schemes in global climate models do not consider a difference between soil dust and mineral dust in terms of ice nucleation activity. Here, we show that particles from the clay and silt size fraction of four different soils naturally associated with 0. 7 to 11. 8 % organic carbon (w/w) can have up to four orders of magnitude more ice nucleation sites per unit mass active in the immersion freezing mode at − 12 °C than montmorillonite, the nucleation properties of which are often used to represent those of mineral dusts in modelling studies. Most of this activity was lost after heat treatment. Removal of biological residues reduced ice nucleation activity to, or below that of montmorillonite. Desert soils, inherently low in organic content, are a large natural source of dust in the atmosphere. In contrast, agricultural land use is concentrated on fertile soils with much larger organic matter contents than found in deserts. It is currently estimated that the contribution of agricultural soils to the global <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> is less than 20 %. Yet, these disturbed soils can contribute ice nuclei to the atmosphere of a very different and much more potent kind than mineral dusts...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impacts of mineral dust aerosol on climate using the {{atmospheric}} component of the U. K. High-Resolution Global Environmental Model (HiGEM) with an interactive embedded mineral dust scheme. It extends earlier work by Woodage et al. in which direct radiative forcing due to dust was calculated and {{in which it was}} reported that the global total <b>dust</b> <b>burden</b> was increased when this was included in the model. Here this result is analyzed further and the regional and global impacts are investigated. It is found that particle size distribution is critically important: In regions where large, more absorbent dust particles are present, burdens are increased because of the enhanced heating aloft, which strengthens convection, whereas, in areas where smaller, more scattering particles dominate, the surface layers are stabilized and dust emissions are decreased. The consequent changes in dust load and particle size distribution when radiative effects are included make the annual mean global forcing more positive {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (0. 33 versus 0. 05 Wm 22). Impacts on the West African monsoon are also considered, where Saharan dust brings about a northward shift in the summertime intertropical convergence zone with increased precipitation on its northern side. This contrasts with results from some other studies, but the authors’ findings are supported by recent observational data. They argue that the impacts depend crucially on the size distribution and radiative properties of the dust particles, which are poorly known on a global scale and differ here from those used in other models...|$|R
