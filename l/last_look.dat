5|$|After being {{disgusted with}} the state of the Square and {{learning}} that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa (Lucy Benjamin), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although, Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub. Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.|$|E

500|$|Trott {{retained}} the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897–98. Stoddart's team got {{away to a}} good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by [...] nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. [...] An exponent of the leg glance, [...] "Ranji" [...] would take a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the field before he took guard. [...] Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about [...] away from him. [...] Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side. Darling said of the plan, [...] "As soon as he had his <b>last</b> <b>look</b> and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. [...] Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game." [...] The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, [...] "Ranji is in a blue funk". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at this quirky {{group of people in}} their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E
500|$|While the Forerunner {{ships are}} being activated, Anders escapes through a {{teleportation}} device and is rescued. Cutter decides {{to destroy the}} Forerunner fleet rather than allow the Covenant to use it. Anders formulates a plan to detonate the ship's faster-than-light drive in the planet's sun, as the explosion would cause a supernova. Before they can prepare the reactor, Forge and the Spartans are ambushed by the Arbiter and his Elites. The Spartans dispatch the aliens and Forge kills the Arbiter. The reactor is damaged during the fight, necessitating a manual detonation. Forge volunteers for the suicidal task, telling the Spartans {{that they will be}} needed in the coming fight. The Spirit of Fire escapes just as Forge overloads the reactor, destroying the Forerunner fleet. Without its faster-than-light drive, the Spirit of Fire is left drifting in space. The crew enters cryonic sleep for long-term storage as Cutter takes a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at Forge's empty cryonic tube. If the game is completed on the [...] "Legendary" [...] difficulty mode, Serina wakes Cutter and tells him that [...] "something has happened".|$|E

500|$|... "Applause" [...] was {{the final}} song Gaga {{performed}} at London's Roundhouse {{as part of a}} show that was broadcast live online on September 1, 2013 for the month-long iTunes Festival. Gaga completed her <b>last</b> <b>look</b> of the show with [...] "a green ringmaster jacket, top hat and sparkly silver boots" [...] and performed the song alongside [...] "an endless supply of supple dancers in gothy fetish wear" [...] who danced behind her on chairs. On September 9, 2013, Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America and appeared dressed as multiple characters from The Wizard of Oz. [...] "Applause" [...] served as the encore during the singer's Artpop launch party event, dubbed the ArtRave, held in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York during the early hours of November 11, 2013.

500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E

2500|$|About the {{two books}} of Esdras , Augustine of Hippo says: [...] "...and {{the two of}} Ezra, which <b>last</b> <b>look</b> more like a sequel to the {{continuous}} regular history which terminates with the books of Kings and Chronicles." [...] The five books of Solomon refer to Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus. The four books of Kings refer to the two books of Samuel and the two books of Kings (see Books of Kings Composition) ...|$|E
2500|$|After a one-off {{performance}} in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999, Europe reunited in 2003 and released [...] Start from the Dark, which peaked at number 2 on the Swedish album chart in 2004.

[...] "This time, we're taking some new directions with our songs, and we're exploring different styles," [...] they stated, [...] "There is a definite classic rock vibe on some of the tracks... a tip of the hat to groovin', funkin' 1970s rock songs - but ones we have bought into the here and now." [...] The second single, [...] "New Love in Town", was released as a digital download on 3 September 2009.|$|E

2500|$|The stone sculptures, in {{the outer}} vaulted corridors, are {{considered}} unique in Bagan. 1500 stone images (mostly unclear due to wear and tear) are seen inside the temple. The special images carved from a single rock (average size is [...] high, [...] broad and [...] thick) are those that depict 80 episodes from Buddha's life. Also seen are forty episodes from the last life of the Lord Buddha, beginning with an image of Setaketu Deva to Prince Siddhartha peeping through the tapestry for a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at his consort Yasodhara and his newborn son Rahula, {{before he left the}} palace for the life of recluse in the forest.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately. With Annabel refusing to offer any more, Miriam, in {{apparent}} desperation, suggests Lewis could find the money. Alice scorns this too, and, before leaving {{to go to the}} Police, stops to tell Miriam has one hell of a sister ... but before she can finish, she collapses. Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter. Before Annabel leaves, she takes one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the tennis court, a tennis ball flies out of nowhere, and she screams.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret {{was finally}} called on Thursday {{afternoon}} and she arrived the next morning. [...] However, Lukwiya's colleagues were strict in the protocols. [...] While {{she was forced}} to sit on a stool three feet away from his bed, she was eventually allowed to hold his foot through three layers of glove. [...] On Sunday, his breathing had become so laboured that he was put on a respirator. [...] By early Monday evening the oxygen level of his blood was rising and his pulse was near normal. [...] It appeared that he might pull through but later that evening Lukwiya's lungs began haemorrhaging, a worst-case scenario. [...] Lukwiya died at 1:20 am on Tuesday, 5 December 2000. [...] When Margaret was informed and came to the ward, the body had already been put into a polyethylene bag. [...] When she asked if they could unzip it a little so she could have a <b>last</b> <b>look,</b> she was refused; the body was too infectious to take any risks.|$|E
