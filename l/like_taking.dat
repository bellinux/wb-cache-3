Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back.

According to the midrashic Book of Jasher, Issachar married Aridah, the younger daughter of Jobab, a son of Joktan; the Torah states that Issachar had four sons, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt, with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus. The midrashic Book of Jasher portrays Issachar as somewhat pragmatic, due to his strong effort in being more learned, less involved with other matters which led him to such actions <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> a feeble part in military campaigns involving his brothers, and generally residing in strongly fortified cities and, depending on his brother Zebulun's financial support in return for a share in the spiritual reward he gains.|$|E

At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine Lăzărescu.

Meanwhile, Lăzărescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or {{because they do not}} feel <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her.|$|E

500|$|From {{his general}} reading, Larkin had {{acquired}} a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: [...] "stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds", who lacked [...] "erotic sensibility" [...] and treated the lesbian perspective [...] "too casually". His intention to write in this genre is expressed {{in a letter to}} his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree Finals: [...] "I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story". The novel was Trouble at Willow Gables, a school adventure story in the manner of Dorita Fairlie Bruce or Dorothy Vicary, which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: [...] "Leaving Oxford was <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me", Larkin later told his biographer.|$|E
