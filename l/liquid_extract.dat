5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a <b>liquid</b> <b>extract.</b> Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results show}} that {{enhancement}} of growth, biochemical and yield parameters of brinjal plant {{might be due to}} the presence of differential level of micro and macro elements, growth hormones, trace elements, vitamins, etc., in the <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> of S. marginatum. Cytokinin and magnesium, which are considered as essential growth promoting constituents in chlorophyll biosynthesis might have {{played a key role in}} the enhancement of growth and physiology of brinjal. However, optimum concentration of seaweed <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> is necessary as the present study exhibited that 1.5  % SLE had better influence on growth and productivity of brinjal plants. It may be suggested that <b>liquid</b> seaweed <b>extracts</b> can be used as substitute for chemical fertilizers to improve the sustainable crop growth and yield. Further, the study also emphasizes that the application of seaweed <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> of seaweeds can be effectively used as eco-friendly approach to organic farming.|$|R

25|$|Grapefruit seed extract (GSE), {{also known}} as citrus seed extract, is a <b>liquid</b> <b>extract</b> derived from the seeds, pulp, and white {{membranes}} of grapefruit. Self-made natural GSE processed in the laboratory without synthetic agents is prepared by grinding the grapefruit seed and juiceless pulp, then mixing with glycerin. Commercially available GSEs sold to consumers are made from the seed, pulp, glycerin (and in some cases synthetic preservatives) all blended together. GSE is sold as a food supplement and used in cosmetics {{because it is a}} claimed natural antimicrobial.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{following}} {{the disruption of}} British Marmite imports after World WarI and prior {{to the introduction of}} Vegemite, Callister's employer, the Australian company Fred Walker & Co., gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries. Callister had been hired by the chairman Fred Walker. Vegemite was registered as a trademark in Australia that same year. Callister used autolysis to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the Carlton & United brewery. Concentrating the clear <b>liquid</b> <b>extract</b> and blending with salt, celery and onion extracts formed a sticky black paste.|$|E

5000|$|Tinctures are {{alcoholic}} extracts of herbs, {{which are}} generally stronger than herbal teas. Tinctures are usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or {{a mixture of}} 100% ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%). Herbal wine and elixirs are alcoholic extract of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12-38%. [...] <b>Extracts</b> include <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts,</b> dry <b>extracts,</b> and nebulisates. <b>Liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> are <b>liquids</b> with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum distilling tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are evaporated into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet.|$|R

500|$|The {{intensely}} peppery {{taste of}} the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing [...] "mild to fatal gastroenteritis". In a 1930 publication, Hans Steidle reported that although the mushroom was not toxic to [...] "unicellular and cold-blooded organisms" [...] when ingested, the <b>liquid</b> <b>extract</b> and the pressed juice of the fruit bodies, when injected under {{the skin of a}} frog, resulted in disturbed breathing, paralysis, and eventually death. Symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea that starts about one hour after ingestion. This combination can lead to dehydration, muscle spasms, and circulatory collapse. The gastroenteritis will usually resolve without treatment in a couple of days.|$|E
500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} used as a {{medicinal}} mushroom by many herbalists. It was used as a poultice to treat inflammations of the eye, as well as a palliative for throat problems. The 16th-century herbalist John Gerard, writing in 1597, recommended A.auricula-judae for a very specific use; other fungi were used more generally. He recommends the preparation of a <b>liquid</b> <b>extract</b> by boiling the fruit bodies in milk, or else leaving them steeped in beer, which would then be sipped slowly in order to cure a sore throat. The resultant broth was probably not dissimilar to the Chinese soups that use A.polytricha. Carolus Clusius, writing in 1601, also said that the species could be gargled to cure a sore throat, and John Parkinson, writing in 1640, reported that boiling in milk or steeping in vinegar was [...] "the onely use the are put unto that I know".|$|E

I find it at once produces a glow, stops rigour, and though it makes one very uncomfortable, prevents the advance of the disease. Hearing of this influenza, {{it occurred to me}} that this might prove remedial; and perhaps a stronger exhibition--injections of cocaine, for instance--still better.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{of both the}} mineral substrate and the humus layer are of key importance in podzol formation. However, {{the properties of the}} forest floor leachates are seldom considered. We measured the complexation capacity by Cu 2 + titration (CuCC), the optical density (E- 4 /E- 6), as well as the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and of major and trace ions in the <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> of forest floors of two Cambisols and two Luvisols on loess under deciduous forest. The vegetation consists of a mixture of beech, oak and maple. The humus type is a fibrimor in one Cambisol and a moder in the three other soils. Both in the solid phase and in the <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts</b> of the forest floors, the Si/(Al + Fe) and C/(Al + Fe) atomic ratios are much larger in the fibrimor than in the moders. In the <b>liquid</b> <b>extracts,</b> the complexation capacity (CuCC) and the density of metal binding sites (CuCC/DOC are larger in the fibrimor than in the moders. These large CuCC and CuCC/DOC in the fibrimor leachate are linked with relatively small stability constant of the humus-Cu complex and relatively large E- 4 /E- 6 ratio, i. e. with reactive organic ligands with low molecular weight and weak aromatic character. These characteristics are associated with current incipient podzolization in the Cambisol with a fibrimor, and might be considered as an indicator of a substantial podzolizing potential of the forest floor.
