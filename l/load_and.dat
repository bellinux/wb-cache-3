50|$|Memory {{dependence}} {{prediction is}} a technique, employed by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors that execute memory access operations (<b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores at instruction execution time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to speculatively execute certain <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores out of order, while preventing other <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the pipeline, memory disambiguation techniques {{are used to}} determine if the <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.|$|R

40|$|A three-bay, space, {{cantilever}} truss is probabilistically evaluated {{to quantify}} the range of uncertainties of buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> member forces due to nonuniform thermal <b>loads,</b> applied <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> moments (mechanical <b>loads),</b> <b>and</b> combination of both. The truss members {{are assumed to be}} made from (1) aluminum tubes or (2) high modulus graphite-fiber/intermediate modulus epoxy-matrix composite tubes. Cumulative distribution function results show that certain combinations of thermal loads with mechanical loads reduce the probabilistic buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> increase the magnitude of the member axial forces for aluminum truss. However, the reverse is true for composite truss due to very low coefficient of thermal expansion and higher stiffness of the composite. Finally, the sensitivities associated with the uncertainties in the structural, material, <b>and</b> <b>load</b> variables (primitive variables) are investigated. They show that buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> member axial forces are most sensitive to the uncertainties in spacial (geometry) variables...|$|R

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently <b>load</b> <b>and</b> unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> unload the train, a movable floor is necessary.

Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymeric {{composites}} exhibit highly nonlinear {{and rate}} dependent behavior during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading in off-axis directions. In this study, off-axis specimens {{were used to}} study this behavior in AS 4 /PEEK thermoplastic composite. The equilibrium states of stress during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading were determined by stress–relaxation and stress–recovery tests, respectively. It {{was found that the}} equilibrium stress–strain curves for <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading are basically the same for the same loading–unloading rate. A one-parameter plasticity model was used to generate a master equilibrium plastic stress–strain curve for both <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading. Stress relaxation curves and recovery curves were obtained during <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading cycles, respectively, for various strain rates. Similarity between relaxation and recovery curves was noted, and the effective stress defined from the one-parameter plastic potential function was able to describe both curves.

5000|$|The first option, making <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores go in-order, avoids RAW dependences {{because there}} is no {{possibility}} of a load executing before its producer store and obtaining incorrect data. Another possibility is to effectively break <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores into two operations: address generation and cache access. With these two separate but linked operations, the CPU can allow <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores to access the memory system only once all previous <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ. After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, <b>and</b> so dependent <b>loads</b> will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete. This scheme still allows for some [...] "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.|$|R
5|$|Shinano was {{designed}} to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of Shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation, although steel shutters could close off most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.|$|E
5|$|The High Line viaduct, then {{a portion}} of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, opened to trains in 1934.

It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to <b>load</b> <b>and</b> unload their cargo inside buildings.
