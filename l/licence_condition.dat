50|$|Anti-siphoning laws in Australia {{regulate}} the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, {{when the country}} experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The anti-siphoning list {{is a list of}} events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public. To effect this 'freedom', the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 includes a <b>licence</b> <b>condition</b> on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events. This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcasters main (core/primary) channel.|$|E

40|$|Minister for Communications Media Release: The Government has today {{asked for}} {{industry}} and public submissions on a draft carrier <b>licence</b> <b>condition</b> for networks that supply superfast carriage services to residential customers. Following the announcement by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on 11 September 2014 on TPG 2 ̆ 7 s plan {{to roll out}} a fibre-to-the-basement (FTTB) network, the Government announced it would consult on a draft <b>licence</b> <b>condition.</b> The draft <b>licence</b> <b>condition</b> would require owners of high-speed networks servicing residential customers to functionally separate their wholesale and retail operations, and {{to provide access to}} competing service providers on the same non-discriminatory terms as those provided to their own retail operations. The carrier 2 ̆ 7 s wholesale company would also need to supply a Layer 2 Wholesale Service to other carriers and service providers, with the price of that service set at 27 per month. The Government 2 ̆ 7 s aim is to ensure that carriers provide wholesale access to FTTB network infrastructure and remove the ability to favour their own downstream retail operations over other retailers on the network. Without such arrangements competition and consumers can suffer. These are equivalent issues to those addressed by the structural separation of Telstra and NBN Co 2 ̆ 7 s wholesale-only operation. The Government is conscious that the ACCC has announced a declaration  inquiry under Part XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, which is relevant to the issue of access. However, such inquiries take time and cannot provide for functional separation.

40|$|In this paper, we {{revisit the}} 2009 - 2012 episode in which Ofgem imposed a {{non-discrimination}} clause on large retailers in the UK energy market. The Standard <b>Licence</b> <b>Condition</b> 25 A (SLC 25 A) {{was introduced to}} prevent suppliers from charging their incumbent customers higher prices than their out-of-area customers. The SLC 25 A included a “sunset clause”, to allow the condition to lapse three years after its implementation.

At {{the end of the}} three-year period, Ofgem decided not to renew SLC 25 A for any period. To further our understanding of Ofgem’s motives and its opponents’ arguments, we build a model where two local monopolists compete on a third market. We determine conditions where the obligation to set the same price {{in and out of the}} local market can result in a better or a worse situation for consumers. We show that even when the ban on price discrimination weakens competition, the average consumer can be better off...|$|E

40|$|In {{a digital}} age public sector {{geoinformation}} (PSGI) is potentially a vital {{link in the}} added-value chain. Yet private sector value-added resellers (VARs) still face a number of barriers to using PSGI. Price is only one impediment. The complexity of licences and restrictive <b>licence</b> <b>conditions</b> of PSGI may be an even bigger obstacle. Especially when combining different datasets, VARs can face a quagmire of conflicting <b>licence</b> <b>conditions.</b> Batty (2006 Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 33; 164) called for research that would stimulate value-added use of PSGI. However, inconsistent and intransparent <b>licence</b> <b>conditions</b> for PSGI are among the biggest obstacles of PSGI for VARs. This paper explores the current PSGI licences to assess the actual restrictions and how current obstacles can be levelled. The Creative Commons licensing concept was explored and adapted to make it suitable for licensing PSGI. The resulting concept of Geo Shared licences is a means to harmonise <b>licence</b> <b>conditions</b> for PSGI. Our {{research shows that the}} Geo Shared concept can be a valuable contribution to further harmonisation of PSGI licences and thus development of value-added chains. Furthermore, development of geographic information infrastructures will also be stimulated. Similarly, the concept can be considered as a serious option within the Infrastructure of Spatial Information for Europe (INSPIRE), as a way towards transparent harmonised licences in Europe and beyond. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{harvest of}} kangaroos in Australia is regulated by various state government agencies. They control {{the number of}} kangaroos that can be harvested annually with the view to ensuring that the harvest remains ecologically and economically sustainable. In addition to controlling the harvest quotas, some agencies impose minimum weight restrictions on harvested animals, which may assist with maintaining viable breeding populations. However, harvesting usually occurs in remote regions and carcases may be stored refrigerated for up to 10 - 14 d before being inspected for compliance with minimum weight restrictions. Consequently, there is concern that weight loss during cold storage, particularly in small carcases close to the minimum limit, could lead to harvesters being wrongly prosecuted or fined for breaching the minimum carcase weight <b>licence</b> <b>condition.</b> We found that for two species of kangaroo, the large eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus; liveweight 30 - 70 kg) and the smaller red-necked wallaby (M. rufogriseus; liveweight 10 - 24 kg), carcase weight loss after 10 days cold storage was negligible. There was no significant effect of species on carcase weight change after 10 days cold storage and their pooled weight change averaged just - 75. 0 ± 18. 0 g, or 0. 35 ± 0. 08...|$|E
40|$|Overview: Since {{the early}} 2000 s and the rapid {{rise of the}} Internet and {{broadband}} as platforms for the digital economy and online society, successive Australian Governments have grappled {{with the issue of}} how to achieve investment in next generation broadband networks capable of supporting future user needs. In parallel with this question, they have had to grapple with how this can be done in a manner that maximises competition recognising that much of the telecommunications customer access network, the last mile connection to individual customers which needed to be upgraded, has strong monopoly characteristics. This means that the firm controlling that network has significant market power, in terms of denying access to would-be competitors and potentially favouring its downstream operations over those of would-be competitors who gained access but had to compete with it. In Australia this meant Telstra, which owns the majority of access infrastructure. These issues would be compounded in the rollout of next generation broadband because if the logical upgrade path was followed, to fibre-to-the-node (FTTN), Telstra’s market power would be further enhanced. This is because if FTTN is to operate at optimal levels it eliminates the ability of competitors to operate their own DSLAM equipment from Telstra’s exchanges and it would generally not be cost-effective to install competing equipment in suburban nodes. This issue has been further compounded by the introduction of vectored VDSL 2 for use with FTTN networks as optimal performance from vectoring can only be achieved if the lines servicing customers are operated by a single provider, who can manage interference problems.

40|$|EPA 650 / 13 : Where {{monitoring}} or {{testing is}} required {{as part of}} an environmental authorisation such as a licence, a monitoring plan is generally required to be submitted to the Environment Protection Authority by the licensee. This guideline sets out the requirements for monitoring plans to assist licensees meet an acceptable standard. 1 Legal framework Under the Environment Protection Act 1993 (EP Act) the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) can require monitoring and testing as a condition of an authorisation or environment protection order (EPO). The most common tool the EPA uses to impose a requirement for monitoring is a condition of authorisation, including licences (section 36), exemptions (section 38) and works approvals (section 35). Section 52 (1) of the EP Act, states that: … the Authority may, by conditions of an environmental authorisation, require the holder of the authorisation to … carry out specified tests and environmental monitoring relating to the activity undertaken pursuant to the authorisation … and to make specified reports to the Authority on the results of such tests and monitoring. … The EPA may also require monitoring as a condition of EPOs (section 93) and clean up orders (section 99). Under clause 44 of the Environment Protection (Water Quality) Policy 2003, the EPA is obliged to impose monitoring where an exemption is granted. 2 Purpose of regulatory monitoring and testing 2. 1 Why does the EPA require monitoring? The EPA may impose monitoring as a condition of authorisation or order, where there is a hazard that the EPA considers to be a priority environmental risk. Generally, the EPA will specify monitoring: to assist with characterising or assessing a priority environmental risk to assist with the management of an environmental risk, eg to assess performance against criteria and therefore assess compliance with a <b>licence</b> <b>condition</b> and/or requirement the EP Act...|$|E
