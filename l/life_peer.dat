5000|$|Prior to the Life Peerages Act 1958, {{membership}} in the House of Lords was strictly male and overwhelmingly based on possession of an hereditary title. There existed a few exceptions to the hereditary principle, such as for the Lords Spiritual. The Act {{made it possible for}} <b>life</b> <b>peers</b> of both sexes to be members of the Lords. <b>Life</b> <b>peers</b> are either barons (a title deprecated for British nobles which has been replaced with Lord for all but the most formal documents since the early medieval period) or baronesses (where female) and are members of the House of Lords for life, but their titles and {{membership in}} [...] "the Lords" [...] are not inherited by their children. Judicial <b>life</b> <b>peers</b> already sat in the House {{under the terms of the}} Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The Life Peerages Act vastly increased the ability of the Prime Minister to change the composition of the House of Lords by permitting the creation of groups of <b>life</b> <b>peers</b> rather than the more difficult to justify hereditary peerages. This gradually began to diminish the numerical dominance of hereditary peers.|$|R
