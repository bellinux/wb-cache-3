[...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E

6000|$|It {{is certain}} {{that he was a}} man of great note and power among the Indians, and one of their most trusted captains. He led the attack on Wheeling in 1777, where he demanded the {{surrender}} of the fort to the English king, whose officer he boasted himself. In 1782 he attacked Bryan's Station in Kentucky with a strong force of Indians, but met with such a gallant resistance that he attempted to bring the garrison to terms by telling them who he was and threatening them with the reënforcements and the cannon which he said he expected hourly. He promised that all their lives should be spared if they yielded, but while he waited with the white flag in his hand on the stump where he stood to harangue them, a young man answered him from the fort: [...] "You need not be so particular to tell us your name; we know your name and you, too. I've had a villainous untrustworthy cur dog this long while named Simon Girty, in compliment to you, he's so <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> as ugly and just as wicked. As to the cannon, let them come on; the country's aroused, and the scalps of your red cutthroats, and your own too, will be drying in our cabins in twenty-four hours; and if, by chance, you or your allies do get into the fort, we've a big store of rods laid in to scourge you out again." ...|$|E
6000|$|The brougham was a {{token of}} harmony, of the fine {{conditions}} papa would this time offer: he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a four-wheeler behind for the boxes. The four-wheeler with the boxes on it was actually there, but mamma was the only lady {{with whom she had}} ever been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a private carriage. Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, still more private, somehow, than mamma's; and when at last she found herself quite on top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she put to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the continuity of a certain sentiment. [...] "Did papa <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> the same while I was gone?" [...] she enquired--full of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence. She had bethought herself that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be only intermittent and for the season. Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst into one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was, seemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and make her jump. Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied: [...] "Why, you little donkey, when you're away what have I left to do but just to love her?" [...] Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had a merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria. Then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely: [...] "I shall make him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that to you I shall carry you straight off and we'll go and live somewhere together and be good quiet little girls." [...] The child couldn't quite make out why her father's speech had been horrid, since it only expressed that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as [...] "immense." [...] To enter more into {{the truth of the matter}} she appealed to him again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn't been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now. [...] "Of course she has, old girl--where else could the poor dear be?" [...] cried Beale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who protested that unless he straightway [...] "took back" [...] his nasty wicked fib it would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too and his house and his tiresome trouble--all the impossible things he had succeeded in putting on her. Beale, under this frolic menace, took nothing back at all; he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating his extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that she was not to listen to his bad jokes: she was to understand that a lady couldn't stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper reason.|$|E
