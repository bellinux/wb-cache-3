25|$|In 1996 Clarke created Artifacts, a {{collection}} of four shovels with the blades down, meant to be <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> wall. The top handles are wrapped in colored ribbons: black, green, red and yellow, colors indicative of the American Indian community. Writing, in black marker, travels around the handle, until {{the top of the}} blade. The four shovels represent his father and one for his three aunts, who are represented on their own shovel by a photograph affixed before the blade. A cattle brand is welded into each shovel blade, like those found on Clarke's family ranch. His goal with Artifacts is to show how one can dig up the past to reveal American Indians in the world today.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher is leaning against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women sat by him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher leaned against the wall and him and Ross by the pool, with Usher singing the verse. The video ends with Ross and Usher echoing the song's title.|$|E
2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> rock, {{and looked}} up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
