5|$|Auks are seabirds {{which are}} superficially similar to {{penguins}} with their black-and-white colours, their upright posture {{and some of}} their habits, but the <b>living</b> <b>species</b> are able to fly. There are about 23 species worldwide, four of which are rare vagrants in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described <b>living</b> <b>species</b> of molluscs {{vary from}} 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described <b>living</b> <b>species</b> at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 <b>living</b> <b>species</b> in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater than the number alive today.|$|E
5|$|Nesomys narindaensis {{is known}} from a damaged skull, missing {{part of the}} back, a {{mandible}} (lower jaw) with the first two molars (m1 and m2), and four isolated molars (one first upper molar, M1, one third upper molar, M3, and two m2). It is larger than {{each of the three}} <b>living</b> <b>species,</b> and the known material additionally differs from those in a few details that may not hold in larger samples. Total skull length is 61.3mm, longer than in the largest <b>living</b> <b>species,</b> N.lambertoni (50.3–53.8mm). The width of the palate between the M1 is 8.7mm (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni) and the length of the upper toothrow is 9.04 and 9.16mm on {{the two sides of the}} skull (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni).|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled <b>living</b> <b>species,</b> and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of <b>living</b> <b>species.</b> The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of <b>living</b> <b>species</b> is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E

5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to <b>living</b> <b>species</b> in South America.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven <b>living</b> <b>species.</b> The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only <b>living</b> <b>species</b> in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E

50|$|The {{total number}} of <b>living</b> {{arthropod}} <b>species</b> is probably {{in the tens of}} millions. One conservative estimate puts the number of arthropod species in tropical forests alone at six to nine million species. As a consequence of all of the above, most published estimates of the {{total number of}} endangered insects and arachnids are probably low by at least an order of magnitude. Conservatively at least eighty percent of all <b>living</b> animal <b>species</b> are arthropods.|$|R
50|$|Raboons, Carnopapio spp.: bipedal (having gaits like predatory theropods), {{carnivorous}} {{descendants of}} baboons from Africa that either hunt or scavenge {{and come in}} a number of <b>species,</b> <b>living</b> on different <b>species</b> of prey and living in family-tribes. Males are larger than females, and only males have manes.|$|R
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most <b>living</b> <b>species,</b> uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Malacostraca is {{the largest}} of the six classes of crustaceans, {{containing}} about 40,000 <b>living</b> <b>species,</b> divided among 16 orders. Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, woodlice, amphipods, mantis shrimp and many other, less familiar animals. They are abundant in all marine environments and have colonised freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are segmented animals, united by a common body plan comprising 20 body segments (rarely 21), and divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen.|$|E
