40|$|Since the {{establishment}} and enforcement of the <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock rebuilding plan in 2007, stock research and evaluation are continuously being conducted on the stock and diverse rebuilding measures are also being considered. The current <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock rebuilding plan emphasizes policies to reduce fishing pressure and create resources, but it is relatively indifferent about the management of habitats and spawning grounds, protection of marine environment and reduction of pollution. More active participation by fishers and better understanding between fishers groups are required for the effective enforcement of the rebuilding plan. Education and information campaigns directed at fishers should be reinforced to support the rebuilding plan as these plans must include broader participation by fishers. Summarizing {{the results of the}} rebuilding plan, {{it is clear that the}} decreasing trend of the <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> stock has been reversed and its catch reached 33, 200 tonnes(M/T) in 2008. The increase is believed to be the result of a combination of rebuilding efforts e. g. clean-up of fishing grounds, stricter enforcement of regulations, fewer Chinese fishing vessels operating in the Yellow Sea and favourable changes in the marine ecosystem where the fisheries are taking place. This demonstrates that management measures must be accompanied by favourable environmental factors in order to be successful and that a holistic approach that addresses various threats to the species be examined. Accordingly, the effect of stock rebuilding plans for <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> on other related fisheries must sufficiently be taken into consideration. In order to rebuild <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> fisheries, a rebuilding plan for the ecosystem must gradually be established and related multi-fisheries should be managed systematically.

The full-length cDNA of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> caspase- 3 (Lyccasp 3) is 2222 bp with an open reading frame of 858 bp encoding a polypeptide of 285 amino acids (aa).

Moreover, several residues known to be critical in the caspase- 3 catalytic centre and binding pocket, as well as the active-site pentapeptide motif Q(172) ACRG(176) were present in the deduced Lyccasp 3. Recombinant Lyccasp 3 (rLyccasp 3) produced in Escherichia coli exhibited obvious hydrolyzing activity against synthetic peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. The Lyccasp 3 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues examined, although the expression levels varied from tissue to tissue. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Lyccasp 3 transcript in spleen and kidney was quickly increased after stimulation with either poly (I:C) or inactivated trivalent bacterial vaccine. Enzyme activities of Lyccasp 3 were also up-regulated in these two tissues post-stimulation when analyzed by hydrolyzing activity assay.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> (Pseudosciaena crocea) is an {{economically}} important marine fish in China suffering from severe outbreaks of infectious disease caused by marine bacteria such as Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila), resulting in great economic losses. However, the mechanisms {{involved in the}} immune response of this fish to bacterial infection are not fully understood. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to such pathogenic bacteria, we used high-throughput deep sequencing technology to investigate the transcriptome and comparative expression profiles of the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> infected with A. hydrophila. Results A total of 13, 611, 340 reads were obtained and assembled into 26, 313 scaffolds in transcriptional responses of the A. hydrophila -infected <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> Via annotation to the NCBI database, we obtained 8216 identified unigenes. In total, 5590 (68 %) unigenes were classified into Gene Ontology, and 3094 unigenes were found in 20 KEGG categories. These genes included representatives from almost all functional categories. By using Solexa/Illumina's DeepSAGE, 1996 differentially expressed genes (P value A. hydrophila -infected fish and control fish, including 727 remarkably upregulated genes and 489 remarkably downregulated genes. Dramatic differences were observed in genes involved in the inflammatory response. Bacterial infection affected the gene expression of many components of signaling cascades, including the Toll-like receptor, JAK-STAT, and MAPK pathways. Genes encoding factors involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling were also revealed to be regulated by infection in these fish. Conclusion Based on our results, we conclude that the inflammatory response may {{play an important role}} in the early stages of infection. The signaling cascades such as the Toll-like receptor, JAK-STAT, and MAPK pathways are regulated by A. hydrophila infection. Interestingly, genes encoding factors involved in TCR signaling were revealed to be downregulated by infection, indicating that TCR signaling was suppressed at this early period. These results revealed changes of multiple signaling pathways involved in immunity during A. hydrophila infection, which will facilitate our comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response to bacterial infection in the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> </p...|$|E

In this work, we used an EcoRI-NlaIII based GBS protocol to teleost <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker,</b> an important commercial fish in China and East-Asia, and reported the first whole-genome SNP development for the species. 69, 845 high quality SNP markers that evenly distributed along genome were detected in at least 80 % of 500 individuals. Nearly 95 % randomly selected genotypes were successfully validated by Sequenom MassARRAY assay. The association studies with the muscle eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content discovered 39 significant SNP markers, contributing as high up to ∼ 63 % genetic variance that explained by all markers. Functional genes that involved in fat digestion and absorption pathway were identified, such as APOB, CRAT and OSBPL 10. Notably, PPT 2 Gene, previously identified in the association study of the plasma n- 3 and n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid level in human, was re-discovered in <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> Our study verified that EcoRI-NlaIII based GBS could produce quality SNP markers in a cost-efficient manner in teleost genome. The developed SNP markers and the EPA and DHA associated SNP loci provided invaluable resources for the population structure, conservation genetics and genomic selection of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> and other fish organisms...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination is an {{effective}} and safe strategy for combating bacterial diseases in fish, but the mechanisms underlying the early immune response after vaccination remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used RNA-seq technology to perform transcriptome analysis of spleens from <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> (Larimichthys crocea) induced by inactivated trivalent bacterial vaccine (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila). A total of 2, 789 or 1, 511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 24 or 72 h after vaccination, including 1, 132 or 842 remarkably up-regulated genes and 1, 657 or 669 remarkably down-regulated genes, respectively. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichments revealed that numerous DEGs belong to immune-relevant genes, involved in many immune-relevant pathways. Most of the strongly up-regulated DEGs are innate defense molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides, complement components, lectins, and transferrins. Trivalent bacterial vaccine affected the expressions of many components associated with bacterial ligand-depending Toll-like receptor signaling pathways and inflammasome formation, indicating that multiple innate immune processes were activated at the early period of vaccination in <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> Moreover, the expression levels of genes involved in antigen processing were also up-regulated by bacterial vaccine. However, the expression levels of several T cell receptors and related CD molecules and signal transducers were down-regulated, suggesting that the T cell receptor signaling pathway was rapidly suppressed after vaccination. These results provide the comprehensive insights into the early immune response of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> to vaccination and valuable information for developing a highly immunogenic vaccine against bacterial infection in teleosts...|$|E

40|$|Small <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} stocks in Korean waters. In this study, we conducted sea trials to estimate optimum height of a drift gill net for effective fishing of small <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker.</b> In the trial using existing net which has 9. 2 m in height, there was 22 species (1, 180 fishes, 99. 9 kg) caught. The catch (in individuals) of small <b>yellow</b> <b>croaker,</b> especially <b>larger</b> fishes (over 22 cm in FL), was higher as part of net height is higher, while the number of species bycaught and the catch of those species were higher as part of net height is lower. In the trial using extension net which has 18. 4 m in height, there was 27 species (2, 030 fishes, 151. 7 kg). It showed same pattern with existing net in the section I to III, however, in the section IV which is over 13. 8 m of net height, the catch sharply decreased. The number of species bycaught and the catch of those species using extension net were also same as results using existing net. It showed that section III (9. 2 － 13. 8 m) where is upper-middle part of the net has caught most of catch and large fishes having over 22 cm in length. Through these results, it is judged that the setting depth of the net where is 4. 6 － 13. 8 m above the sea bottom is the best to reduce bycatch and catch much more large size fishes, and the catch per net is proportional to filtering area of net. Therefore the Fisheries Resource Management Act (the clause 1, article 10) on th...|$|R
40|$|In this study, length-weight {{relationships}} and relative condition {{factors were analyzed}} for <b>Yellow</b> <b>Croaker</b> (Larimichthys polyactis) along the north coast of China. Data covered six regions from north to south: Yellow River Estuary, Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong, Jiaozhou Bay, Coastal Waters of Qingdao, Haizhou Bay, and South Yellow Sea. In total 3, 275 individuals were collected during six years (2008, 2011 - 2015). One generalized linear model, two simply linear models and nine linear mixed effect models that applied the effects from regions and/or years to coefficient a and/or the exponent b were studied and compared. Among these twelve models, the linear mixed effect model with random effects from both regions and years fit the data best, with lowest Akaike information criterion value and mean absolute error. In this model, the estimated a was 0. 0192, with 95 % confidence interval 0. 0178 ~ 0. 0308, and the estimated exponent b was 2. 917 with 95 % confidence interval 2. 731 ~ 2. 945. Estimates for a and b with the random effects in intercept and coefficient from Region and Year, ranged from 0. 013 to 0. 023 and from 2. 835 to 3. 017, respectively. Both regions and years had effects on parameters a and b, while the effects from years were shown to be much larger than those from regions. Except for Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong, a decreased from north to south. Condition factors relative to reference years of 1960, 1986, 2005, 2007, 2008 ~ 2009 and 2010 revealed that the body shape of <b>Yellow</b> <b>Croaker</b> became thinner in recent years. Furthermore relative condition factors varied among months, years, regions and length. The values of a and relative condition factors decreased, when the environmental pollution became worse, therefore, length-weight relationships could be an indicator for the environment quality. Results from this study provided basic description of current condition of <b>Yellow</b> <b>Croaker</b> along the north coast of China...|$|R
