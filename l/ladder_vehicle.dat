5000|$|The [...] "autoscala" [...] is a <b>ladder</b> <b>vehicle</b> used {{to reach}} high floors, trees, etc. It can reach heights of 20 mt up to 50 mt in larger vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A fold-down front-passenger {{seat was}} a feature on the Chrysler PT Cruiser to fit longer {{items such as}} a 8-foot (2.4 m) <b>ladder</b> inside the <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The game's {{improvements}} included {{introduction of}} true room-over-room situations, {{the use of}} 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable <b>ladders,</b> and assorted <b>vehicles</b> to drive (some armed with weapons). Although violent, the game had its own {{sense of humor and}} contained some sexual themes. A combination of Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition was published by GT Interactive Software in March 1998, titled East Meets West.|$|R
50|$|Only four {{buildings}} exceed {{four stories}} in height. Until a major fire on January 6, 1952, the Westfield Professional Building covered half a downtown city block and was six stories tall. The entire building was consumed with extensive damage to neighboring buildings because the fire department's <b>ladder</b> and snorkel <b>vehicles</b> weren't tall enough {{and the building}} {{did not have a}} sprinkler system. Subsequent zoning prohibited virtually all new construction over three stories, even after improvements in fire suppression technologies and vehicles became available. No building is allowed to be taller than the town's firetruck ladders.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} the body is made of Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP), and the bonnet and panels are alloys. The body is mounted on a <b>ladder</b> chassis. The <b>vehicles</b> have a long wheel base of 3.2 m (126"). A variety of power units can be fitted to the kit, {{including}} Ford, Nissan and Rover. The suspension, steering, pedal box and master cylinder can be sourced from the Ford Sierra.The manufacturer provides a lot of choice in body parts such as windscreens and lights, meaning there are many unique vehicles in circulation.|$|R
40|$|Loading/unloading a <b>ladder</b> on <b>vehicles</b> are {{frequent}} tasks and involve overhead handling that may expose workers to {{risk factors of}} shoulder musculoskeletal disorders. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate posture, forces required and perceived exertion when loading and unloading the ladder on a utility truck. Thirteen male overhead line workers from an electric utility in Brazil participated in this study. Shoulder elevation angle was measured using inclinometers. The required force to load/unload the ladder was measured by dynamometer. Subjective assessment of the perceived exertion was recorded to compare the exertion reported during the test conditions to the field conditions. The task of loading/unloading the ladder presented risks of shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) to workers because it requires high levels of force (approximately 60 % of the maximal force) combined with overhead posture of the shoulders (more than 100 ï¿½ from the neutral posture). Age and height presented to interfere in biomechanical risks presented in load/unload task. There was no significant difference between the subjective exertion during the test conditions and handling the ladder in the field. Ergonomic intervention is recommended to reduce these risks for shoulder MSDs...|$|R
60|$|We {{reached the}} hotel before nine o'clock. Next morning we left for Geneva {{on top of}} the diligence, under shelter of a gay awning. If I {{remember}} rightly, there were more than twenty people up there. It was so high that the ascent was made by <b>ladder.</b> The huge <b>vehicle</b> was full everywhere, inside and out. Five other diligences left at the same time, all full. We had engaged our seats two days beforehand, to make sure, and paid the regulation price, five dollars each; {{but the rest of the}} company were wiser; they had trusted Baedeker, and waited; consequently some of them got their seats for one or two dollars. Baedeker knows all about hotels, railway and diligence companies, and speaks his mind freely. He is a trustworthy friend of the traveler.|$|R
