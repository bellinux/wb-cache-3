40|$|In Wireless Local Area Networks (wlans), data is {{transferred}} through the ether. To prevent that unauthorized users read or modify data, security is needed, {{not only to}} secure data transmission but also to authorize users and machines to the network. A secure <b>log-on</b> <b>procedure</b> can be created {{with the help of}} cryptographic functions. However, these functions are often computationally intensive which results in a slow <b>log-on</b> <b>procedure.</b> This work focuses on the design of the hardware acceleration of a wlan authentication proceduce. The hardware acceleration is used in the Secure Remote Password (srp) authentication protocol, but can be used in other security related computations as well. The experimental platform is tutwlan, a wlan platform being developed at Tampere University of Technology which runs on the Altera Excalibur development board that contains a chip with programmable hardware and a microprocessor...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} Integrated Academic Information System (IAIMS) at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center provides {{data sharing}} links between two separate corporate entities, namely Columbia University Medical School and The Presbyterian Hospital, using a network-based architecture. Multiple database servers with heterogeneous user authentication protocols {{are linked to}} this network. "One-stop information shopping" implies one <b>log-on</b> <b>procedure</b> per session, not separate log-on and log-off procedures for each server or application used during a session. These circumstances provide challenges at the policy and technical levels to data security at the network level and insuring smooth information access for end users of these network-based services. Five activities being conducted {{as part of our}} security project are described: (1) policy development; (2) an authentication server for the network; (3) Kerberos as a tool for providing mutual authentication, encryption, and time stamping of authentication messages; (4) a prototype interface using Kerberos services to authenticate users accessing a network database server; and (5) a Kerberized electronic signature...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{presented}} that examine disclosure of sensitive information and personalization in Internet-based surveys. In the first study, {{the impact of}} a personalized salutation on two forms of non-disclosure to a sensitive personal question (salary level) is tested. The results revealed that a personalized salutation tends to increase levels of active non-disclosure (measured through use of an I prefer not to answer option), but not passive non-disclosure (where the respondent selects no option). In the second study, participants are directed to the study via either a personalized URL (which incorporated an encoded identifier not obvious as such to the responder) or via a secure log-on page that required the user to type in identifying information. Non-disclosure to a sensitive question (salary) was significantly higher when participants went through a <b>log-on</b> <b>procedure.</b> We suggest that this pattern of non-disclosure to sensitive questions reflects increases in identifiability when a personalized salutation or logon procedure is used. We further suggest that the provision of an active non-disclosure option to a sensitive question is particularly appropriate in contexts in which anonymity may be compromised, since it enables participants to both protect their privacy and respond appropriately to the survey...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis reports {{the results of}} a study which tested participants' abilities to recall five different types of computer passwords. Each participant was assigned in a randomized procedure to one of six response intervals. Recall testing of computer-generated passwords, user-created passwords, passphrases, associative passwords and cognitive passwords was conducted using a computer program which simulated <b>log-on</b> <b>procedures.</b> This study indicates the relative merits of these five password types are more difficult to distinguish when data are collected in the realist setting of a log-on simulation instead of via paper surveys, as was done in previous research.

40|$|Software {{development}} for the Trospheric Air Motion Measurement Systems (TAMMS) is documented. In July/August the TAMMS was flown on the NASA/Goddard Flight Center Electra aircraft for 19 mission for the ABLE- 2 A (Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment) in Brazil. In December 1985, several flights were performed to assess the contamination and boundary layer of the Electra. Position data, flow angles, pressure transducer measurements were recorded. The programs written for the ABLE- 2 A were modified due to timing considerations for this particular program. The 3 -step programs written for EBLE (Electra Boundary Layer Experiment) are described. Power up and <b>log-on</b> <b>procedures</b> are discussed. A few editing techniques are described for modification of the programs...|$|R
40|$|A unit on online data {{retrieval}} techniques {{designed for a}} college course in international marketing is described. The unit is intended to teach students how to compile information on overseas markets and competitors. Online retrieval {{is seen as a}} relatively inexpensive means of gathering-important data from otherwise inaccessible international sources. The required hardware include a computer or computer terminal, a hard or floppy disk storage device, and a modem. Also necessary is communications software that can handle <b>log-on</b> <b>Procedures</b> for each information service used, maintain- user confidentiality, and allow capture and storage of all displayed text. In a class assignment, students conduct a study of real market opportunities for real regional or relevant hypothetical firms. The assignment consists of a cultural analysis, economic analysis, and product/market evaluation, with eac...|$|R
