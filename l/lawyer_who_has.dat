25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion.

Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E

500|$|Urania Cabral and {{her father}} Agustín Cabral appear in both the modern day and {{historical}} portions of the novel. [...] In the year 1996, Urania returns to the Dominican Republic {{for the first time}} since her departure at the age of 14. [...] She is a successful New York <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> spent most of the past 35 years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood, a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with Trujillo and Dominican history. [...] Urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past, and is compelled to confront her father Agustín about his role in those events. [...] Urania visits her father, finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke, so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence, let alone speak. [...] Agustín listens helplessly as Urania recounts his past as [...] "Egghead Cabral", a high-ranking member of Trujillo's inner circle, and his drastic fall from grace. [...] Urania details Agustín's role in the events that led to her rape by the Dominican leader, and to her subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma. Agustín's character in the modern day portion of the novel serves primarily as a sounding board for Urania's recollections of the Trujillo era and the events that surrounded both Agustín Cabral's disgrace and Urania's escape from the country. [...] His responses are minimal and non-vocal, despite the ardency of Urania's accusations and the enormity of his own actions during Trujillo's reign.|$|E
