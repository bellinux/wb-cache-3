Social integration consists of many sources such as religious, social, and political memberships.

50|$|In {{philosophy}} and religion the passions are the instinctive, emotional, primitive drives {{in a human}} being (including, for example, lust, anger, aggression and jealousy) which a human being must restrain, channel, develop and sublimate {{in order to be}} possessed of wisdom. Passions in religion and philosophy have a different connotation from the popular concept of passion which is generally seen as a positive emotion. The philosophical notion of passion, in contrast, is identified with innate or biologically driven emotional states regarded in ancient philosophies and the great religions as being the basis for deadly sins and seen as leading to various social and spiritual ills such as unstable relationships, broken marriages, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration,</b> psychological disorders and other problems. In the philosophical tradition of the west passion is often placed in opposition to reason.

40|$|Social media {{provide a}} wide space for people {{from around the}} world to communicate, share {{knowledge}} and personal experiences. They increasingly become an important data source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis, thanks to shared comments and reviews about products and services. And companies are showing a growing interest to harness their potential, in order to support setting up marketing strategies. Despite the importance of sentiment analysis in decision making, there is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> intelligence <b>integration</b> at the level of customer relationship management systems. Thus, social customer relationship management (SCRM) systems have become an interesting research area. However, they need deep analytic techniques to transform the large amount of data “Big Data” into actionable insights. Such systems also require an advanced modelling and data processing methods, and must consider the emerging paradigm related to proactive systems. In this paper, we propose an agent based social framework that extracts and consolidates the reviews expressed via social media, in order to help enterprises know more about customers’ opinions toward a particular product or service. To illustrate our approach, we present the case study of Twitter reviews that we use to extract opinions and sentiment about a set of products using SentiGem API. Data extraction, analysis and storage are performed using a framework based on Hadoop MapReduce and HBase. ...|$|R
40|$|Decision-making in {{the child}} {{protection}} services is a challenging task, in particular for workers who operate in a multicultural context. Studies have found that children from immigrant groups are overrepresented in the rates of cases reported to CPSs because of the higher prevalence of some distal risk factors. However, it remains unclear whether these distal factors may also lead to child removal interventions by CPS workers. This research compared immigrant and Italian families on the factors included in the Protocol of risk and protective factors to deepen the knowledge of CPS professionals’ decision-making process (Di Blasio, 2005). <b>Social</b> records <b>of</b> 175 immigrant families and 153 Italian families referred for child maltreatment to CPSs were analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an initiative commenced in Semester 1 2012 {{in a small}} rural town in Queensland, Australia, to address {{the high level of}} attrition experienced by tertiary bridging students studying by distance in regional areas. It was hypothesised that the attrition was caused by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> and academic <b>integration</b> into the program. The initiative involved the conducting of face-to-face teaching and a study group on a weekly basis at a partner institution. The collaboration between the university, the local partner institution and representatives of local government and community organisations involved in identifying potential students and supporting those students once enrolled is described. The major findings of the initiative to date relate to the high incidence of a change in the circumstances of students which challenged continued attendance in the bridging program, the difficulties of distance students in relation to the administrative requirements of the university and the challenges associated with the completion of a high volume of assessment in the early transition weeks of the semester. The primary relevance the initiative has for providers of distance tertiary bridging programs relates to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support that distance students have when experiencing these challenges. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare health status between native and {{immigrant}} early adolescents in Italy and to analyse related psychosocial factors. Data were taken from “Health Behaviour in School Aged Children” (HBSC), a cross-sectional survey investigating health behaviours among early adolescents in selected European countries. A representative sample of 6, 744 (50. 4 % males) Italian students (11, 13 and 15 years old) completed a questionnaire. Students were assessed for demographics characteristics, socio-economic conditions, social support and bullying victimization, and, as dependent variables, for health complaints, self-reported health, life satisfaction and happiness. It turned out that immigrant adolescents, as compared to natives, are more often affected by psychosomatic symptoms, less satisfied about their health and about life, and less happy. A multiple regression model showed that migration itself is related to life satisfaction and happiness. Socio-economic inequalities, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and victimization determine the differences between immigrants and natives in terms of health symptoms and self-reported health.

The highest number of students drop out during the first academic year. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> and academic <b>integration</b> has been theorized to be a major force in influencing dropout behavior among these students. Therefore, if both <b>social</b> and academic <b>integration</b> could be significantly increased, first-year students would be more likely to remain in college. In the present study, the perception <b>of</b> both <b>social</b> and academic <b>integration</b> were more positive among an experimental group of students who were offered a mentoring program than for the control group who were not.

40|$|Background: Studies have {{consistently}} reported {{higher rates of}} suicide amongst Irish migrants in Britain than in {{the population as a}} whole. Leavey offers a hypothetical model to explain such rates that incorporates <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion and <b>integration</b> meshed with the inability to establish an authentic identity and other contributory factors. Material: Systematic review methodologies are used to examine the central tenets of this explanatory framework. Some of the macro-level ecological associations in the model are critically evaluated in the context of findings from the 1991 Census and government social and household panel surveys. Discussion: The evidence base suggests that statements on social isolation and reluctance to use health care services are questionable and Irish migration is shown to be much more heterogeneous than the model suggests. Only small positive, and as yet unreplicated, associations have been established between identity and health behaviour in a non-representative sample and evidence is <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> Irish stoicism and anti-Irish racism as putative risk factors. Epidemiological studies show that adjusting suicide rates for social class explains virtually none of the excess in Irish migrants, although higher risks for unmarried persons are reported. Explanations in the literature for higher rates of migrant suicide are discussed. Conclusions: Studies based on individual-level analysis and record linkage are urgently needed to explain the high rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Interpersonal {{violence}} (IPV) {{is associated}} with higher risk of depression. Female Chinese rural-to-urban migrants may experience greater depression following exposure to IPV due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> support and <b>integration</b> within their receiving communities. The current study estimated the prevalence of IPV among rural-to-urban migrants in Guangzhou, China, and evaluated the moderating effects <b>of</b> <b>social</b> resources on migrant's depression symptoms. Method: We recruited 1, 368 women (1, 003 migrants and 365 local-born) of childbearing age from population and family planning centers in two districts using a quota sampling method matched to the 2012 population census. Chinese versions of the Conflict Tactics Scale 2 Short Form, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Social Support Rating Scale measured IPV, depression, and <b>social</b> support. <b>Social</b> <b>integration</b> was measured with a locally derived scale. Results: Migrants reported a similar prevalence for IPV (41. 20 %) to local women (39. 20 %). Bivariate comparisons demonstrated that migrants reported greater depression (11. 8 ± 8. 9 vs. 10. 0 ± 8. 8, t=− 3. 27, p< 0. 001) and less social support (22. 2 ± 5. 1 vs. 27. 1 ± 5. 5, t= 14. 84, p< 0. 001). Regression analysis indicated {{that the effect of}} violence on depression symptoms for migrant women was moderated by <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> Women who experienced violence and had greater integration in their community reported less depression than women who experienced violence but reported less <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> Conclusion: A high prevalence of IPV was reported in our sample. <b>Social</b> <b>integration</b> is a key risk factor for migrant mental health.

40|$|Since Nigeria’s {{independence}} in 1960, {{the country has}} continuously been confronted with among other issues, the problem of a weak and unjust social structure resulting in widespread social injustice. It {{is at the root}} of most of the crises and <b>social</b> malaise <b>of</b> the Nigerian society and is made more serious by the problems associated with ethnicity and arbitrariness by the state and government. Part of the resultant effects of this weak structure include unjust public institutions and social, ethnic, religious and political crises due mainly to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion, political <b>integration</b> and an unfair principle of distribution of income, resources, goods and burdens in the society. All attempted palliatives by different administrations have all failed and a very bitter 3 -year civil war between 1967 and 1970 in which more than a million lives were lost was the first major manifestation of the problem in post colonial Nigeria. This condition of affairs not only makes political stability and development difficult but also stifles the natural ingenuity of the people to grow. And very serious poverty and underdevelopment of the people in addition to a complete absence of liberty and rights have become institutionalised. In reaction, some Nigerians have resorted to all sorts of immoral, illegal and criminal actions and conduct, including corruption, lawlessness, indiscipline, tribalism, nepotism, and ethnicism, etc. Others have joined the political class and accepted the status quo of injustice as justice and hold this to be the proper and easiest way to achieve their life goals. This has inadvertently led to a warped and distorted sense of justice in the society. This sense of justice sees nothing wrong with vices such as public and institutional injustice, crime, fraud, corruption etc and embraces them wholeheartedly. I propose in this research therefore, the analysis of the fundamental ideas and ideals of John Rawls’ political liberalism as contained in his Political Liberalism as a way of addressing these social-political challenges. In doing this, the merits and intentions of Rawls’ two principles of justice which centre on liberty, equality and differences are examined to deduce their level of coherence, relevance and utility to the Nigerian society. An argument will be made that these two principles represent the closest philosophical and sociological paradigm that have the core ideas and ideals necessary in addressing the twin problems <b>of</b> <b>social</b> injustice and political instability in a third world disordered society such as Nigeria.

Comparisons between pupils with and without special education needs (SEN) illustrate that pupils with special education needs (SEN) felt less socially integrated.

40|$|Norbert Elias {{provides}} {{a very useful}} theoretical framework for understanding long-term changes in childhood-adulthood relations at the societal level. Key processes central to this theorization include: the increasing separation of the social worlds of children and adults; the increasing distance between childhood and adulthood; the partial defunctionalisation of the family; the civilizing of parents; changes in the "we-I balance" towards the "I"; and the gradual conversion of social constraints into self-restraints. Yet variable trajectories are under-developed in Elias' work: the differing nature of these interrelated social processes for different "outsider" groups in society were not systematically addressed by him. However, this paper argues that Elias's theories on childhood do {{provide us with a}} very useful conceptual framework from which to understand these variable trajectories. It applies his theories on childhood and individualization to Gypsy-Traveller/Roma groups in Europe. The paper argues that the above processes differ markedly for many groups and, coupled with the existence of a very strong group orientation and long-term stigmatisation, are central to accounting for their relative <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration.</b> That is, differing processes of childhood and family socialisation are crucial in explaining how Gypsy-Traveller/Roma groups have maintained their own group identity and cultural continuity under intense pressures to assimilation and conformity...|$|E
40|$|Administrative {{intervention}} on {{young people from}} Latin American origins and who belong to youth gangs can be relatively complex, at least from a legal standpoint. On one hand, {{the young people in}} question may possess varying types of legal status (foreigners-nationals, youths-adults, regular or irregular) which determine the type of administrative intervention that is applied. On the other hand, the resources and routes of administrative intervention that currently exist ({{intervention on}} minors deemed to be socially at risk, youth justice, prosecution for crimes, etc.) should be modulated and adapted to the peculiarities of these groups, and of the young people themselves. This study is based on the premise that, with certain exceptions, the youth gangs that exist in our cities still do not possess a criminal structure or organisation comparable to the Maras of Central America or the “Latino gangs”, but rather that their proliferation is a symptom of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>integration</b> and the educational failure of these young people in our society. As a consequence, the article stresses that in addition to policing and legal initiatives aimed at fighting crime, {{there is a need to}} reinforce social and educational resources to prevent this phenomenon and, particularly, a need to enlarge and make more flexible the non-regulated education-training services that currently exist in order that they should serve as a bridge for these young people’s insertion into the labour market, and thus to prevent their social and legal exclusion...|$|E

Can we even talk about classical examples of travelling Gypsies in Hungary in the Communist era? The literature published so far claims that most statistics on Romani people in Hungary are unreliable. This doesn’t mean that the results of research carried out on this topic should be completely ignored, but the data have to be considered cautiously. It is especially true for surveys after 1945, since at that time highly different methods were used to determine the proportion of Romani people in the Hungarian society; hence the divergent results and obscurity of actual numbers.
