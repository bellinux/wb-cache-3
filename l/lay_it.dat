But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E

25|$|The First World War {{introduced}} killing {{on such a}} {{mass scale}} that few nations were prepared to cope with it. Millions of bodies were never recovered, or were recovered long after any identification could be made. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were buried on the battlefield where they <b>lay.</b> <b>It</b> was often impossible to dig trenches without unearthing remains, and artillery barrages often uncovered bodies and flung the disintegrating corpses into the air. Many bodies were buried in French municipal cemeteries, but these rapidly filled to capacity. Due to the costs and sheer number of remains involved, Australia, Canada, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom barred repatriation of remains.|$|E

500|$|Palmerston died in 1865, {{and after}} a brief {{ministry}} led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first time}} since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. [...] "Everyone likes flattery," [...] he said, [...] "and when you come to royalty you should <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> on with a trowel." [...] With the phrase [...] "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were [...] "a public meeting rather than a woman".|$|E
500|$|Although {{initially}} {{curious about}} Disraeli {{when he entered}} Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. [...] He told Matthew Arnold, [...] "Everybody likes flattery; and, {{when you come to}} royalty, you should <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, Adam Kirsch, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, Lord Melbourne. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to kiss hands, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, [...] "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage." ...|$|E

[...] The other said, [...] "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me."

Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.|$|E

With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really <b>lay</b> <b>it</b> out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

[...] The English magistrate and social reformer John Fielding, who was blind, is pictured entering from the left saying [...] "I should be glad to see this spirit", while his companion says [...] "Your W——r's had better get your Warrant back'd by his L—rds—p", referring to a Middlesex magistrate's warrant which required an endorsement from the Lord Mayor, Samuel Fludyer.
