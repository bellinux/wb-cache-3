It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips.

40|$|Some of the {{problems}} that are observed in Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements are related to insufficient compaction of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints,</b> segregation, or low material density. In particular, construction of quality <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> continues {{to be one of the}} most problematic areas for HMA pavement performance and this problem may have a special role in porous asphalt concretes; because of the difficulty in compacting the unconfined edges, lower density zones can occur at the joints and therefore the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> between asphalt mats can deteriorate faster than other areas. This contributes to the ultimate performance, then to pavement life and life cycle cost. Therefore, road agencies are now setting more rigorous compliance standards for joint density, requiring best-practice construction and effective quality control in order to guarantee a 100 % pay factor. These issues influence maintenance and rehabilitation costs and scheduling and there are many consequences for performance-based planning, programming and management. In the light of above facts, a literature review on construction equipments and measurement methods has been performed. The main objective has been confined to the analysis of the reliability of high-speed devices in detecting density non-conformities especially in joints area. In order to pursue the objectives, in-lab and on-site experiments were designed and performed; different measurement methods (vacuum sealing method, portable non-nuclear devices, etc.) have been used. On the basis of the obtained results, specific recommendations have been made for practical applications...|$|R

50|$|Physiology Goussians share {{a similar}} morphology, with certain {{characteristics}} remaining widely conserved throughout the genera. In general goussians have thin walled oocysts lacking a micropyle, which contain four bivalve sporocysts. The two valves composing the sporocyst are identical {{and have a}} single <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> running along the midline. In some specific species there is a dual membrane structure which {{is associated with the}} joint. These associated membranes are quite delicate and can be difficult to observe under an electron microscope as the fixation process often leads to damage or the full destruction of this membranous structure. As do many apicomplexans, Goussia feature a conical shaped structure towards the apical end of their cells made of fibers, which are currently unknown, that surround the rhoptries. The conoid is thought to have a mechanical function and assist in the entrance into host cells in order to form a characteristic parasitophorous vacuole. Rhopteries and micronemes are located below the conoid in the apical end of the cell. These two organelles have a unique secretory function and aid in the adhesion to enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract. This ensures that Goussia is able to gain substantial access to host cells, before being passed through the host with the feces. Members of the genera Goussia also retain apical polar ring, which act as Micro tubule organizing centers in the cell, and apicoplasts, which are specialized plastids involved in various synthesis activities carried out by the cell, (Heame, lipids etc..). It has been noted that the destruction of the apicoplast does not immediately kill the cell, but it prevents it from infecting other host cells. Apicoplasts are currently being investigated as a potential drug target to treat apicomplexans; {{due to the fact that}} it is derived from previously photosynthetic algae, herbicidal medications may be able to effectively treat these parasitic conditions without harming any of the host metabolic processes.|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{background}} information for code prescriptions for the shear and torsion interaction in hollow core floors, finite element analyses of some basic cases were made. A simplified global model for complete floors developed in Lundgren et al. (2003) was used. A set-up with two simply supported hollow core units connected along a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> {{and support of}} tie beams was modelled. The hollow core units were loaded with a point load situated at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> Several parameters were varied; i. e. the section height, the slab length, an assumed gap in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint,</b> stiffness of the tie beams, and the loading position. When the two hollow core units are loaded, they will deflect and rotate equally much, as there is symmetry. Therefore, no shear force will be transferred in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> Compressive contact forces will appear at the upper edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint,</b> while the lower edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> will open without any force transfer. The main studied result from the analyses is {{the distribution of the}} contact forces along the upper edge of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> The results show that the contact forces in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> had typically a peak where the point load was applied. When no gap was assumed in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> and the tie beams were assumed to be infinitely stiff, compressive contact forces appeared towards the supports, almost in triangular shaped blocks. These blocks decreased and vanished when the stiffness of the tie beams decreased, and also when there was a gap in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint.</b> In the analyses where a gap was assumed in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> between the hollow core units, no contact is obtained for low loads. After a certain load, contact is obtained, and the contact forces between the hollow core units start to act. This load can be predicted by hand calculations. As the analyses are non-linear, the results from various load cases can not be super positioned. This was demonstrated in one example. In the studied set-up with only two hollow core units, the deflections in horizontal bending were of the same magnitude as the deformations due to torsional rotations. Therefore, very small reductions in torsional moments were observed. The torsional moments would most likely be more reduced if floors with more hollow core units were studied...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} construction practices, a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> is sawed in a PCC (Portland Cement Concrete) pavement {{to control}} concrete shrinkage cracking between two lanes of traffic. Sawing a joint in hardened concrete {{is an expensive}} and time consuming operation. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> is not a working joint (in comparison to a transverse joint) as it is typically tied with a tie bar at 30 inch spacing. The open joint reservoir, left by the saw blade, typically is filled or sealed with a durable crack sealant to keep incompressibles and water from getting into the joint reservoir. An experimental joint forming knife has been developed. It is installed under the paving machine to form the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> in the wet concrete {{as a part of}} the paving process. Through this research method, forming a very narrow <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> during the paving process, two conventional paving operations can be eliminated. Joint forming eliminates the need of the joint sawing operation in the hard concrete, and as the joint that is formed does not leave a wide-open reservoir, but only a hairline crack, it does not need the joint filling or sealing operation. Therefore, the two conventional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> sawing and sealing operations are both being eliminated by this innovation. A laboratory scale prototype joint forming knife was built and tested, initially forming joints in small concrete beams. The results were positive so the method was proposed for field testing. Initial field tests were done in the construction season of 2001, limited to one paving contractor. A number of modifications were made to the knife throughout the field tests. About 3000 feet of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> was formed in 2001. Additional testing was done in the 2002 construction season, working with the same contractor. About 150, 000 feet of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> was formed in 2002.

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements {{are commonly used}} (1) : • Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) has transverse joints spaced less than about 5 m apart and no reinforcing steel in the slab. JPCP may, however, contain steel dowel bars across transverse joints and steel tiebars across <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints.</b> • Jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP) has transverse joints spaced about 9 to 12 m apart and contains steel reinforcement in the slab. The steel reinforcement is designed to hold tightly together any transverse cracks that develop in the slab. Dowel bars and tiebars are also used at all transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints,</b> respectively. • Continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) has no regularly spaced transverse joints and contains more steel reinforcement than JRCP. The high steel content influences the development of transverse cracks within an acceptable spacing and serves to hold these transverse cracks tightly together.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the level of compaction at the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> and determine the effect of segregation on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> performance. Five paving projects with the use of traditional butt joint, infrared joint heater, edge restraint by milling and modified butt joint with the hot pinch <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joint</b> construction techniques were selected in this study.

In general, this study finds that the minimum required joint density should be around 90. 0 % of the theoretical maximum density based on the AASHTO T 166 method. The restrained-edge by milling and butt joint with the infrared heat treatment construction methods both create the joint density higher than this 90. 0 % limit.

40|$|The {{failure of}} <b>longitudinal</b> {{construction}} <b>joints</b> {{is one of}} the critical factors causing accelerated pavement deterioration. Poor-quality <b>longitudinal</b> construction <b>joints</b> are often characterized by a difference in elevation between adjacent lanes or by unraveling of the hot mix asphalt (HMA). Current wave-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are efficient and economical for the evaluation of material properties. In this thesis, an innovative surface wave testing technique for condition assessment of <b>longitudinal</b> construction <b>joints</b> in asphalt pavements is presented. This method enables reduction of the number of cores required for large-strain testing and provision of a more uniform quality assessment of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> as well as the relative condition of the asphalt pavements. The technical development is based on a theoretical study of the wave attenuation mechanisms and on the reported deficiencies in current seismic wave-based methods. Traditionally, the use of ultrasonic testing to determine small-strain elastic property for asphalt concrete was uniquely based on the measurement of wave velocity. However, isolated use of wave velocity does not provide complete information of the materials strength because of the different variables that affect the strength-velocity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to complement velocity data with independent information such as the change in attenuation and frequency content of the propagating pulse. The existing deficiencies in current seismic wave-based methods were addressed to improve reliability, accuracy and consistency for asphalt concrete material characterization in the laboratory and in the field. Refined and improved signal processing techniques were used to overcome the shortcomings in the existing wave-based methods that contribute to uncertainties in the interpretation of test results. To capture more information from a wave, the signal was analyzed in the time and frequency domains. The basic analyses included a simple method such as peak to peak amplitude of the first cycle of arriving wave, and complex methods such as maximum magnitude and area of corresponding frequency spectrum through Fourier transform. A novel approach based on wavelet transform of the signal was presented, which provides an alternative method to determine wave characteristics. Material characterization tests (experiment Phase I) were carried out to study the relationship between the wave characteristics obtained from UPV test {{and the quality of the}} asphalt concrete specimens prepared in the laboratory. The specimens were identical in terms of aggregate and asphalt binder ratio, but varying in volumetric properties produced by different compaction efforts. The specimen quality was determined using two methods: 1) the traditional method using density measurement and 2) an innovative approach using dynamic modulus which is recommended by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for use as a fundamental material property for characterizing Superpave mixes (Witczak, et al., 2002; Bonaquist et al., 2003; Christensen et al., 2004). The measured wave characteristics showed excellent correlations (R 2 > 0. 9) with the fundamental properties of the mix. The results revealed that the wave amplitude parameters as the condition index have the potential to provide a reliable assessment of the quality of HMA mixtures. The finding is very critical to moving the technology forward in the right direction, and form an important basis for the experiment Phase II. Experiment Phase II investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using the wave characteristics identified in experiment Phase I to assess the condition of <b>longitudinal</b> construction <b>joints.</b> Particular attention was given to examining the sensitivity of the wave-based technique to different types of construction joints. For this purpose, three types of construction joints (good, fair and poor) were fabricated in the laboratory and identified using the wave-based technique. The research was intended to develop a suitable test procedure for condition assessment the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> in asphalt pavement in the field. The data from experiment Phase II revealed that the wave-based technique enables assessment of not only the quality of different types of <b>longitudinal</b> construction <b>joints</b> but also the relative condition of asphalt pavements...|$|R

Full scale three point load test are carried out on 14 composite slab specimens with different surface roughness and surface condition of the HCU before casting the concrete topping.

40|$|Precast double-tee (DT) floor {{systems with}} cast-in-place {{concrete}} toppings reinforced with welded wire fabric (WWF) often suffer from durability problems along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> of adjacent DTs. The high strain demand along these joints leads to cracking {{of the concrete}} topping, exposing the steel reinforcement to an aggressive environment resulting in corrosion. Carbon fiber grid (G-Grid) reinforcement is proposed {{as a replacement for}} the WWF to address this problem. This thesis presents an experimental program designed to investigate the longitudinal shear behavior of C-Grid reinforced concrete. Twenty-two single-shear test specimens were designed to simulate the joint of adjacent DTs with topping. The objective was to obtain the fundamental shear-slip behavior and compare it to that of WWF reinforced specimens. Parameters included the reinforcement ratio and grid orientation. In addition, this thesis also looks at, through direct tension tests, C-Grid’s potential to interfere with the bond between the DT and the topping. It was found that, at least in the small-scale tests, steps should be taken to prevent this premature cold joint debonding. Two methods – chairing the C-Grid, or significantly roughening the DT surface – were shown to be adequate to prevent thi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Complex {{statistical}} analysis of stresses in concrete slab of the real type of rigid pavement is performed. The computational model of the pavement is designed as a spatial (3 D) model, {{is based on a}} nonlinear variant of the finite element method that respects the structural nonlinearity, enables to model different arrangement of joints, and the entire model can be loaded by the thermal load. Interaction of adjacent slabs in joints and contact of the slab and the subsequent layer are modeled with help of special contact elements. Four concrete slabs separated by transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> and the additional subgrade layers and soil to the depth of about 3 m are modeled. The thickness of individual layers, physical and mechanical properties of materials, characteristics of joints, and the temperature of the upper and lower surface of slabs are supposed to be random variables. The modern simulation technique Updated Latin Hypercube Sampling with 20 simulations is used for {{statistical analysis}}. As results, the estimates of basic statistics of the principal stresses σ 1 and σ 3 in 53 points on the upper and lower surface of the slabs are obtained.

40|$|Heavy Weight Deflectometer (HWD) {{tests were}} {{routinely}} conducted on three Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) test {{items in the}} Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA 2 ̆ 7 s) National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) to verify the uniformity of the test pavement structures and to measure pavement responses during full-scale traffic testing. A six-wheel aircraft landing gear with dual-tridem configuration was trafficked {{on the north side}} of the test pavement while the south side was trafficked by a four-wheel landing gear with dual tandem configuration. HWD tests were conducted before and during traffic testing at slab center, at <b>longitudinal</b> <b>joints</b> and at transverse joints. Substantial corner cracking occurred in all three of the rigid pavement test items after 28 passes of traffic had been completed. Trafficking continued until the rigid items were deemed failed. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based approach for backcalculating the NAPTF rigid pavement properties. The study findings illustrate the complexity of backcalculating properties of rigid pavements subjected to full-scale dynamic traffic testing. Apart from other complicating factors such as the slab curling and warping behavior, the test pavements exhibited corner cracks within few passes of traffic loading which further complicated the interpretation of HWD test results...|$|R
