As a part of the urban infrastructure, the drainage networks of pluvial and residual waters are included in the plan of promoting the systems which protect the environmental quality, with the purpose of integrated and adaptive management. The paper presents a distributed control system for sewer network of Iasi town. Unsatisfactory technical state of the actual sewer system is exposed, focusing on objectives related to implementation of the control system. The proposed distributed control system of Iasi drainage network is based on the implementation of the hierarchic control theory for diagnose, sewer planning and management. There are proposed two control levels: coordinating and local execution. Configuration of the distributed control system, including data acquisition and conversion equipment, interface characteristics, <b>local</b> <b>data</b> <b>bus,</b> data communication network, station configuration are widely described.

40|$|We study a coupling/decoupling method {{between a}} superconducting qubit and a <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> {{that uses a}} {{controllable}} time-dependent electromagnetic field (TDEF). As in recent experiments, the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> can be either an LC circuit or a cavity field. When the qubit and the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> are initially fabricated, their detuning should be made far larger than their coupling constant, so these can be treated as two independent subsystems. However, if a TDEF {{is applied to the}} qubit, then a "dressed qubit" (i. e., qubit plus the electromagnetic field) can be formed. By choosing appropriate parameters for the TDEF, the dressed qubit can be coupled to the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> and, thus, the qubit and the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> can exchange information {{with the assistance of the}} TDEF. This mechanism allows the scalability of the circuit to many qubits. With the help of the TDEF, any two qubits can be selectively coupled to (and decoupled from) a common <b>data</b> <b>bus.</b> Therefore, quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another.

40|$|The {{bottleneck}} {{for many}} parallel and distributed applications on networks of workstations {{is the high}} cost of communication on traditional network interfaces. Memory-mapped network interfaces provide latencies of a few microseconds and bandwidths close to the maximum of the <b>local</b> I/O <b>bus.</b> <b>Data</b> is transferred directly between memories without involving the operating system, thereby inducing very little processor overhead. A major drawback with the current operating system support is that applications have to deal directly with data consistency and the allocation and placement of pinned physical memory. We propose a more elaborate interface, called SciOS, that provides a shared-memory abstraction where physical memory is treated like in a NUMA architecture. To lower the average memory access times, we use a relaxed memory model and dynamic page migration and replication combined with use of idle remote memory instead of disk swap.

40|$|Crosstalk {{has become}} the great {{challenge}} to the design community in Deep-submicron (DSM) and Very Deepsubmicron (VDSM) technologies. As the portion of silicon area for interconnects and buses is dominating, crosstalk effect also dominates in deciding the reliability and performance of the SoCs and many types of processors. These interconnect and buses are prone to errors due to crosstalk. The {{major part of the}} crosstalk is due to coupling transitions occurring on the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> and interconnects when signals are transmitted. One of the favorable techniques to reduce the crosstalk is to reduce the coupling transitions. Bus encoding technique is the promising method to reduce the crosstalk. Hence an efficient Crosstalk reduction <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> encoding scheme is proposed which can reduce the 6 C, 5 C and 4 C crosstalk for 64 -bit <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> around 88 %, 68 % and 24 % respectively, for 32 -bit <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> around 89 %, 74 % and 32 % respectively and 16 -bit <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> by 93 %, 71 % and 19 % respectively...|$|R
