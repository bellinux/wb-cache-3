50|$|Beta toxin is the {{principal}} disease causing toxin in C. perfringens type B infection. Type B has caused <b>lamb</b> <b>dysentery</b> in Great Britain and South Africa. Enterotoximia caused by a strains of Type B has been seen in foals in Great Britain and sheep and goats in Iran. Vaccines {{have been developed to}} combat <b>lamb</b> <b>dysentery</b> in sheep flocks at high risk.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Moredun {{go back to}} the years {{following}} World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and <b>lamb</b> <b>dysentery.</b> Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} {{statement of}} Dalling, that the <b>lamb</b> <b>dysentery</b> bacillus rapidly liquefies inspissated horse serum has been confirmed. A serial subculture of Dalling's original strain {{has lost its}} liquefactive power. The power of liquefying solid serum (or the lack of this power) should not be applied as a "major" test in classifying a lamb dysentery-like micro-organism.

40|$|Evidence is {{provided}} {{to prove the}} specificity of the flocculation test used {{as a tool for}} assaying the beta fraction of Cl. welchii Type B toxin and its corresponding antitoxin. The separation from Cl. welchii Type B (" 1930 strain") of variants which differ in the production of toxin and mucoid material is described. A medium and method of cultivation are described by means of which a maximum yield of 560 Lf per mi. of beta toxin was obtained. By using a sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer system a purified beta toxin containing 7, 396 Lf per mg. P. N. was produced. The keeping qualities of beta toxin under varying conditions were determined. The toxoiding of beta toxin (both crude and purified) was investigated. The stability of beta toxoid was determined. A study was made of alum precipitation of beta toxoid with varying concentrations of potash alum at different pH levels. APT was proved to be a better antigen than liquid toxoid. II was proved experimentally that sheep, immunized with two doses of APT, each containing from 6 · 25 Lf to 200 Lf and separated by an interval of two weeks, would have a mean circulating antitoxin titre of about 50 units per ml. one week after the second stimulus. As a result of a series of experiments in which the booster effect produced by beta toxoid was investigated the conclusion was reached that the essential requirement for an effective booster response is a solid basic immunity. When the latter is present the dose and nature of the booster injection are of secondary importance. It was proved that APT containing 6 · 25 Lf beta toxoid per dose {{could be used as a}} primary, secondary and booster stimulus for the prevention of <b>lamb</b> <b>dysentery.</b> The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
