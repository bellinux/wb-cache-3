25|$|Since {{incandescent}} light bulbs use {{more energy than}} alternatives such as CFLs and <b>LED</b> <b>lamps,</b> many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than {{can be achieved by}} incandescent lamps. Measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the European Union, the United States, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia, among others.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study concerning an improved heat sink {{for a light}} emitting diodes (<b>LED)</b> <b>lamp</b> operating under natural convection conditions. Basic geometry of the heat sink is of cylindrical nature, to be obtained from cutting an aluminum extruded bar comprising a cylindrical central core {{and a number of}} uniformly distributed radial fins. Minimum diameter of the central core is fixed and the parameters to be explored are the number of fins, their thickness, length (radial dimension) and height. Although not included in the numerical simulations, the thermal resistance due to the use of a thin thermal interface material (TIM) layer between the <b>LED</b> <b>lamp</b> back and the heat sink is taken into account in the analysis. The main objective of the heat sink is to cool the <b>LED</b> <b>lamp</b> so that the lamp maximum temperature at the contact region with the heat sink is maintained below the critical temperature given by the manufacturer. This is a crucial aspect in what concerns the expected lifetime of the <b>LED</b> <b>lamp</b> and should be achieved at the expenses of as low as possible aluminum mass. Taking these criteria in mind, a design procedure is proposed and followed in the search for the improved heat sink to cool a particular <b>LED</b> <b>lamp.</b> Results obtained with the commercial code ANSYS-CFX clearly show the relative importance of the different governing parameters on the heat sink performance and allow the choice of the better solution within the frame of dimensional constrains. Although the present results concern a particular <b>LED</b> <b>lamp,</b> the proposed methodology can be extended to other types of heat sinks for general light and/or electronic components...|$|R
