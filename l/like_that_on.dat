5|$|Bonstelle {{was born}} to Helen and Joseph Bonesteel on her father's farm {{near the town of}} Greece, New York, the {{youngest}} of their eight children. Her exact date of birth is unknown, and she kept it a secret, but it was sometime in November 1869 – 1871. Originally named Bonesteel, later in life she changed it to Bonstelle after, according to legend, seeing it misspelled <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a theater marquee.|$|E
5|$|The Mary Rose {{represented}} a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though {{the introduction of}} guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, {{they needed to be}} placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the Mary Rose was built. This made broadsides, coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible {{for the first time in}} history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The undress gown {{or black}} gown {{is similar to}} the MA gown (for PhD, LittD, ScD and in {{practice}} DD) or is a 'lay-type' gown similar to that worn by Queen's Counsel (LLD, MD, MusD). Different doctorates are distinguished from each other and from the plain MA gown by different arrangements of lace on the sleeves, facings or flap collar. The DD traditionally had a gown with sleeves <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> American gowns being gathered at the wrists which are called 'bishop's sleeves' or 'pudding sleeves'.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} {{featured}} the 147's dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate {{could also be}} controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose stereo system were available, the stereo system could now also be operated via buttons {{on the steering wheel}}. Also the Selespeed gearbox control system was updated, buttons on the steering wheel were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault and service monitor.|$|E
25|$|During the 2nd {{half of the}} 4th century BC, mythological themes {{disappeared}} from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a krater by the Den Haag Funnel Group Painter were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted oinochoai, lekythoi and drinking bowls of the Torcop Group, and plates of the Genucuilia Group. The switch {{to the production of}} black glaze vases {{near the end of the}} 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.|$|E

A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, unless {{you want it to be}} <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>On</b> Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E

500|$|Admiral Lord Fisher first {{presented}} his {{requirements for the}} new ships to the DNC on 18 December, before they had even been approved.

Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December, and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December.|$|E

500|$|Observations {{from the}} SMARTS {{telescope}} {{show that in}} visible light Sedna {{is one of the}} reddest objects in the Solar System, nearly as red as Mars. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a surface coating of hydrocarbon sludge, or tholin, formed from simpler organic compounds after long exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects – [...] and [...] – share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a similar region of origin.|$|E

500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final, Maguire ended O'Sullivan's 14-match unbeaten {{run with a}} 6–1 victory to earn {{a place in the}} final against Higgins. Maguire made century breaks in the first two frames, {{becoming}} the first player to make five consecutive century breaks (including the three made in his previous match). Maguire won the third on the pink after O'Sullivan missed the yellow. O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51, before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames. After the match, O'Sullivan—who had won all three previous encounters against Maguire—said, [...] "I've never seen anything <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a snooker table before... He's a great player, probably {{the best in the world}} at the moment", and even before the match, O'Sullivan had described Maguire as [...] "of the young ones, definitely the best". The defeat meant that Reardon lost the £100 bet he placed at 150–1 that O'Sullivan would win all eight of the season's ranking events.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} was {{fraught with}} tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance. The track {{was the first}} Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident, but he hated it and declined to do so. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, Lennon said it was [...] "more of Paul's granny music" [...] and left the session. He {{spent the next two}} weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for [...] "Come Together" [...] was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, adding [...] "we had to play {{it over and over again}} until Paul liked it. It was a real drag". Starr was more sympathetic to the song. [...] "It was granny music", he admitted, [...] "but we needed stuff <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> our album so other people would listen to it". Starr played the anvil sound in the chorus. This track also makes use of Harrison's Moog Synthesizer, played by McCartney.|$|E

Young specimens have a sticky layer of gluten on the cap that dries out in maturity. The edge of the cap is rolled inwards in young specimens. The flesh of the cap is whitish and does not change color when bruised or cut. The tubes {{on the underside of}} the cap are light yellow to bright orange-yellow; the tube mouths are usually less than 1mm wide. The stipe is usually between [...] long, less frequently reaching up to [...] It is either the same width throughout or slightly larger (bulbous) at the base. The color of the upper portion of the stipe is pale to light yellow, while the lower portion may be light brown or covered with streaks of glutinous material <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> the cap. The stipe surface is covered with fine glands that are initially slightly darker than the color of the stipe surface, but deepen to brown or nearly black after drying. The color of the spore print was not determined from the initial collections, but is thought to be yellow-brown to brown based on the accumulated spore deposit seen on the surface of the caps of neighboring fruit bodies.|$|E
500|$|Released in May 2008, {{the video}} was {{directed}} by music video director Melina Matsoukas, {{and is based on}} the thematic content of the song of being in a party. The video begins with Gaga arriving with her background dancers at a house party, which seems to have ended. One of the dancers puts a Discolite Boombox on, blaring the music through the house. The crowd at the party appear to be sleeping in different areas, and are awoken by the music. They all start to dance, and scenes of the party are intercut with scenes of a scantily dressed Gaga dancing in a poncho, with a disco ball or in a small rubber pool playing with an inflated killer whale. She wears a blue, lightning-bolt shaped sticker beneath her right eye <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> the single cover, which paid tribute to the album cover of David Bowie's Aladdin Sane, as he is one of her musical idols.
