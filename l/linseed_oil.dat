30|$|To {{characterize}} the <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> produced, both the hydraulic and wind-mill expressed <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> {{were subjected to}} a series of chemical analyses: the amount of free fatty acids (acid value) and the degree of unsaturation in the fatty acids (iodine value) were determined to record their starting conditions and quality, and to compare them with each other. In addition, full chemical analysis of the triglycerides of the raw wind-mill oil was performed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} order to determine the effect of dietary fatty acid profile on deposition of body fat, carcass fat, and separable fat de-pots. Diets with four types of fat (tallow, olive, sunflower, and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils)</b> at an inclusion level of 10 % were admin-istered to female broiler chickens. In Experiment 1, total body fat, carcass fat (total body fat minus abdominal fat), and abdominal fat (AF) were determined. In Experiment 2, several separable fat depots (abdominal, neck, sartorial, and mesenteric fat) were removed and weighed. In gen-eral, the analyzed separable fat depots were reduced in broilers fed sunflower or <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> with respect to those fed tallow or olive oil (P < 0. 05). Percentages of body and carcass fat were also slightly reduced in birds fed (Key words: broiler, dietary fatty acid profile, separable fat depot, body fat, carcass fat...|$|R

When these {{materials}} {{come into contact}} with polyunsaturated vegetable <b>oils</b> (<b>linseed,</b> massage <b>oils),</b> bacteria slowly decompose the materials, producing heat. If {{these materials}} are stored in a way so the heat cannot escape, the heat buildup increases the rate of decomposition and thus the rate of heat buildup increases.

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> on the floor. The <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with <b>linseed</b> <b>oil,</b> at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with <b>linseed</b> <b>oil.</b> While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was {{determined}} the particular fatty characteristics of various vegetable oils in dependence on their storage life and storage conditions. Storage conditions were defined by room temperature and coolroom temperature. The fourteen oils were used for analyses, namely <b>linseed</b> <b>oils,</b> castor oil, grape seed oil, almond oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, corn oil, rice bran oil, macadamia nut oil, soya bean oil, pumpkin seed oil and sunflower oil. All tested oils were supplied by firm M+H, Míča a Harašta s. r. o. The fatty characteristics included the saponification value, the acid value, the iodine value and the thiobarbituric value. The ester values and the percentage glycerol content were counted {{on the basis of}} the saponification value and the acid value. Time dependences of all fatty characteristics were figured to graphs and they were compared on various storage conditions. The fatty characteristics indicated lower values in storage of oil samples in coolroom than at laboratory temperature...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the serious}} {{objections}} to milk, which is otherwise considered {{an important component of}} human nutrition, is its rather unfavourable com-position of fatty acids. Therefore there have been numerous attempts to manipulate the composition of milk fat. Apart from genetic approaches, the content of milk components can be influenced by dietary manipulation (Kennely and Glimm, 1998). The percentage of undesirable saturated fatty ac-ids (SFA) can be decreased and the percentage of desirable monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyun-saturated (PUFA) fatty acids can be increased at the same time by inclusion of feed components to the diet such as rapeseed, soybean or <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> (Dhiman et al., 2000; Reklewska et al., 2002; Collomb et al., 2004) or rapeseed cake (Jahreis e...|$|R
25|$|A {{traditional}} wooden bat has {{its surface}} oiled with raw <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> before play, and regularly during the season. This has a protective {{effect on the}} wood, and also makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed. Raw <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> is used, rather than boiled <b>linseed</b> <b>oil,</b> as {{this is not a}} drying oil to the same degree, and so the surface remains tacky.|$|E

40|$|Sunflower, corn, rapeseed, olive, and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> {{were used}} for investigation. Their fatty-acid {{compositions}} have been evaluated by gas chromatography. The tribological properties were determined with a four-ball machine. Flash and set points, static and dynamic viscosity of the oils were estimated by standard methods. The results of tests show that refined plant oils possess better tribotechnical properties than the base mineral oil without additives. It was found that their antiwear and bearing resistance properties correlate with the structure of fatty acids molecules. It is demonstrated that the activation of unsaturated bonds {{as a result of}} the triglycerides oxidation has a positive influence on friction due to tribopolymerization and film formation on the contact surfaces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the influence of}} diets supplemented with fish and vegetable oils on fatty acid and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) contents in livers of non- 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) - and DMBA-treated rats, and in DMBA-induced tumours. Decreased concentrations of saturated fatty acids and increased unsaturated fatty acid levels were observed in liver phospholipids of rats fed these oils. There was a marked difference in the concentrations of fatty acids found in the tumours and those present in liver lipids. Oleic acid was the main unsaturated fatty acid found in the tumour tissue. Both liver and tumour PGE 2 contents were clearly correlated to the diet. The PGE 2 concentrations were decreased in livers and tumours of rats fed fish (FO) and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> (LO) ...|$|R
25|$|Poppyseed oil {{has been}} used for {{painting}} for at least 1500 years—one of the oldest known oil paintings, found in caves of Afghanistan and dated to AD 650, was likely drawn using poppyseed oil. It is most often found in white paints, and as a varnish. Painters prepared poppyseed oil by hand until the late 19th century, when oil paints became available prepared in tubes. While poppyseed oil does not cause as much yellowish tinting of paints as <b>linseed</b> <b>oil,</b> it dries slower and is less durable than <b>linseed</b> <b>oil</b> because the fat responsible for the yellowing also provides durability. Perilla oil, which causes yellow tinting even more than linseed, is even more durable than linseed.|$|E

40|$|Green {{composites}} {{have been}} produced from natural oils and agricultural co-products or residues. A variety of natural oil-based resins, both free radically- and cationically-cured, and agricultural filler/fiber reinforcements have been utilized in their production. The natural oils and agricultural filler/fibers of interest include tung, corn, soybean, fish, and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> and spent germ, corn stover, wheat straw, and switchgrass. The structure, water absorption, and thermal and mechanical properties of the composites has been studied using Soxhlet extraction, thermogravimetric and dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile testing. These novel composites contain anywhere from 60 to 95 % renewable materials and have properties suitable for nonstructural applications, such as automotive panels, wall panels, ceiling tiles, window frames, furniture and doors, in the automotive, construction and furniture industries...|$|R
40|$|Data are {{presented}} on the kinematic viscosity, in the temperature range - 50 degrees to + 30 degrees C. of pure liquids and of solutions of animal oils, vegetable oils, mineral oils, glycerine, and ethylene glycol in various low freezing point solvents. It is {{shown that the}} thermal coefficient of kinematic viscosity {{as a function of}} the kinematic viscosity of the solutions of glycerine and ethylene glycol in alcohols is practically independent of the temperature and the chemical composition of the individual liquids. This is similarly true for the mineral oil group and, for a limited temperature interval, for the pure animal and vegetable oils. The efficiency of naphthol, hydroquinone, and diphenylamine to inhibit the change of viscosity of poppyseed and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> was also investigated...|$|R
50|$|Saturated fats can stack {{themselves}} in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature. For example, animal fats tallow and lard are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids. Olive and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> {{on the other hand}} are unsaturated and liquid. Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 food calories (37 kJ = 8.8 kcal). Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol itself can be converted to glucose by the liver and so become a source of energy.|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} {{vegetable}} oils with different lipid compositions have been processed under hydrothermal {{conditions in the}} presence of transition metal doped zeolites (containing molybdenum, chromium, cobalt and iron). The lipids processed include sunflower, soybean, jatropha, palm and <b>linseed</b> <b>oils</b> over a temperature and pressure range of 250 – 350 °C and 12 – 17 MPa respectively. The products have been analyzed using a combination of GC-MS, FAME analysis, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and simulated distillation (using thermogravimetric analysis TGA). Hydrothermal processing of lipids results in the hydrolysis of the triglycerides at low temperatures. Lipids high in polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid promote cross linking and cyclization reactions resulting in “heavier molecular weight” wax-like material. Saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acids are more stable. Some of the catalysts, such as un-doped zeolite (HZSM- 5) and molybdenum doped zeolite (MoZSM- 5) favor the formation of alkenes and aromatic compounds in the kerosene and gasoline boiling point range...|$|R
40|$|Fossil fuel {{resources}} are being depleted {{day by day}} and its use affects the environment adversely. Renewable energy {{is one of the}} alternate for sustainable development and biodiesel is one of the suitable alternate which can replace the diesel. The major hurdles in the successful commercialization of biodiesel are high feedstock cost and conversion technology to reduce viscosity. The choice of raw material and biodiesel production method must depend upon techno-economical view. There are some specific regions for different types of oil availability. It is therefore required to produce biodiesel from the mixture of oils to fulfill the requirements of energy demand in a particular country according to its suitability and availability of feedstock. Karanja and Linseed crops are abundantly available in India. Biodiesel was produced from a mixture of Karanja and <b>Linseed</b> <b>oils</b> by alkaline transesterification. In this experimental study, biodiesel blends of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % were used with diesel in a diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm with varying brake powers (loads) from 0. 5 kW to 3. 5 kW to evaluate brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific energy consumption, exhaust gas temperature, mechanical efficiency, volumetric efficiency, air fuel ratio and smoke opacity. They were compared with diesel and found satisfactory. BTE was found to be 28. 76 % for B 10 at 3. 5 kW load. Smoke opacity was also found to be reduced with all blends. Smoke opacity was found to be reduced up to 10. 23 % for B 10 biodiesel blend as compared to that of diesel at 3. 5 kW. Experimental investigation has revealed that biodiesel produced from a mixture of Karanja and <b>Linseed</b> <b>oils</b> can be successfully used in diesel engines without any engine modification and B 10 was found to be an optimum biodiesel blend in terms of brake thermal efficiency.
