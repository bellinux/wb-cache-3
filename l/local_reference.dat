25|$|Rather than {{exceeding}} {{the speed of}} light within a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame, a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel. Objects cannot accelerate to {{the speed of light}} within normal spacetime; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space without breaking any physical laws.|$|E

But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "centripetal" [...] {{component}} of acceleration resembles that for circular motion at radius rB, while the perpendicular component is velocity dependent, increasing with the radial velocity v and {{directed to the}} right of the velocity. The situation could be described as a circular motion combined with an [...] "apparent Coriolis acceleration" [...] of 2ωv. However, this is a rough labelling: a careful designation of the true centripetal force refers to a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame that employs the directions normal and tangential to the path, not coordinates referred to the axis of rotation.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} examples of unincorporated communities place names throughout the state. These areas are {{administered by the}} town or municipality in which they exist. [...] They serve as useful <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> to specific places and are important references and sometimes included in vital records. Many of these named places contain a small cluster of houses, a church or local business such as store or tavern. Although {{they do not have}} any governmental function, most are recognized for the common usage and are marked with official green informational highway signs listing the place name with the word 'Unincorporated' underneath. [...] Most of these named places are also placed on the official Wisconsin state highway maps [...] issued by the Wisconsin DOT but these names were not listed in the index on the same maps until several years ago. [...] Examples include Frog Station, Poland, and North Leeds.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} reference ellipsoids {{have been}} used in the history of geodesy. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of GPS, it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as WGS84) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within [...] of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link WGS84 to the <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> ellipsoid with its associated grid.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} federal {{election}} of May 1979 to a minority Conservative government led by Joe Clark. When Pierre Trudeau regained power in February 1980, he appointed Chrétien Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In this role, he was {{a major force in}} the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives [...] "on the ground" [...] during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the 1980 referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the non committee about the best course to follow, with Ryan favoring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien's unabashed Canadian nationalist message. In his speeches, Chrétien boosted the first white men to see the Prairies and the Rocky mountains had been the French-Canadian voyaguers and Coureur des bois in the 17th and 18th centuries, saying the Rockies and the Great Plains were part of French Canada's heritage, and asked how could the Québécois ever give up their heritage. Chrétien praised the great French fur traders like Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and La Vérendrye who ventured west, saying what they had found belonged to all of French Canada, and often ended his speeches with the remark [...] "I want them [...] for my children and grandchildren!", which frequently brought his audiences to tears. Chrétien delivered an average of 6 or 7 speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and always managed to work in a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> in every speech.|$|E
