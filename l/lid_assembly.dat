In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, but it is not essential.

The CP and RPs pertain distinct structural characteristics and biological functions. In brief, 20S sub complex presents three types proteolytic activities, including caspase-like, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like activities. These proteolytic active sites located in the inner side of a chamber formed by 4 stacked rings of 20S subunits, preventing random protein-enzyme encounter and uncontrolled protein degradation. The 19S regulatory particles can recognize ubiquitin-labeled protein as degradation substrate, unfold the protein to linear, open the gate of 20S core particle, and guide the substate into the proteolytic chamber. To meet such functional complexity, 19S regulatory particle contains at least 18 constitutive subunits. These subunits can be categorized into two classes based on the ATP dependence of subunits, ATP-dependent subunits and ATP-independent subunits. According to the protein interaction and topological characteristics of this multisubunit complex, the 19S regulatory particle is composed of a base and a lid subcomplex. The base consists of a ring of six AAA ATPases (Subunit Rpt1-6, systematic nomenclature) and four non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, Rpn2, Rpn10, and Rpn13).s The lid sub complex of 19S regulatory particle consisted of 9 subunits. The assembly of 19S lid is independent to the assembly process of 19S base. Two assembly modules, Rpn5-Rpn6-Rpn8-Rpn9-Rpn11 modules and Rpn3-Rpn7-SEM1 modules were identified during 19S <b>lid</b> <b>assembly</b> using yeast proteasome as a model complex. The subunit Rpn12 incorporated into 19S regulatory particle when 19S lid and base bind together. Recent evidence of crystal structures of proteasomes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that the catalytically active subunit Rpn8 and subunit Rpn11 form heterodimer. The data also reveals the details of the Rpn11 active site and the mode of interaction with other subunits.|$|E

During substrate degradation, the 19S regulatory particles undergo a conformation switch that is characterized by a rearranged ATPase ring with uniform subunit interfaces. Notably, Rpn11 migrates from an occluded position to directly above the central pore, thus facilitating substrate deubiquitination concomitant with translocation.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe 26 S {{proteasome}} is {{the major}} ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotes and thus involved in regulating a diverse array of vital cellular processes. Three subcomplexes form this massive degradation machine: the lid, the base, and the core. While assembly of base and core has been well-studied, the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in formation of the nine-subunit lid remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that helices found at the C terminus of each lid subunit form a helical bundle that directsÂ the ordered self-assembly of the lid subcomplex. Furthermore, we use an integrative modeling approach to gain critical insights into the bundle topology and provide an important structural framework for our biochemical data. We show that the helical bundle serves as a hub through which the last-added subunit Rpn 12 monitors proper <b>lid</b> <b>assembly</b> before incorporation into the proteasome. Finally, we predict that the assembly of the COP 9 signalosome depends on a similar helical bundle...|$|E

40|$|The 26 S {{proteasome}} is {{the major}} ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotic cells. The 19 S proteasome regulatory particle, consisting of the lid and base subcomplexes, recognizes and processes poly-ubiquitinated substrates. In this thesis I report the development of heterologous expression systems for the base and lid subcomplexes, and I use these new systems, along with biochemistry and electron microscopy, to map {{the architecture of the}} massive 19 S regulatory particle, reveal the ordered self-assembly of the lid, and demonstrate structural and functional asymmetries in the AAA+ base unfoldase. I describe the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes, and the unfolding machinery at subnanometer resolution, thereby outlining a substrate's path to degradation, providing the structural basis for the ability of the proteasome to degrade a diverse set of substrates and thus regulate vital cellular processes. Furthermore, I show that a helical bundle serves as a hub through which the last-added subunit, Rpn 12, monitors proper <b>lid</b> <b>assembly</b> prior to incorporation into the proteasome.

40|$|Large {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} predominantly {{used throughout the}} mining industry to power haulage, utility, and personnel-carrier vehicles. Without proper operation and maintenance, {{the use of these}} batteries can introduce mechanical and electrical hazards, particularly in the confined, and potentially dangerous, environment of an underground coal mine. A review of the Mine Safety and Health Administration accident/illness/injury database reveals that a significant number of injuries occur during the maintenance and repair of lead-acid batteries. These injuries include burns from electrical arcing and acid exposure, as well as strained muscles and crushed hands. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health investigated the design and implementation of these batteries to identify safety interventions that can mitigate these inherent hazards.

40|$|The growing {{field of}} tissue {{engineering}} requires {{the design and}} verification of an environmentally-controlled sterile incubator volume. As this technology advances and the field of cell printing emerges, {{the need for such}} a volume increases. This volume shall maintain post-deposition cell viability of printed cells, by maintaining volume sterility and controlling temperature. This becomes more important as more delicate cells are used. Sterility maintenance prevents contamination of the cells, while temperature regulation maintains the optimum temperature for cell viability. Several existing incubator systems are capable of regulating environmental conditions, but none are designed to function with a moving cell deposition head. The Sterile Incubator Volume System was developed to accommodate cell printing needs. The primary challenge was to create a sterile volume, with environmental conditions suitable for cell growth; it must interface with a moving deposition head. Numerous engineering practices were included in this design process: defining design inputs and outputs, brainstorming, using decision matrices, considering manufacturing constraints, prototyping, and testing. The final design consists of a portable, self-contained volume capable of maintaining cell viability for at least 4 hours. This environment features feedback-regulated temperature, which is controlled via an external feedback loop by a proportional-integral-derivative (P-I-D) temperature controller. This configuration optimizes temperature regulation while minimizing the risk of contamination from external elements by placing the heating element external to the sterile volume. The volume is compact (62 Ì 2 x 62 Ì 2 x 22 Ì 2), with an easily removable snap-fit <b>lid</b> for simple <b>assembly</b> and disassembly in a sterile hood. A latex cover maintains sterility inside the container while allowing adequate movement of the deposition syringe. A septum permits the syringe to penetrate the latex and be removed without compromising the interior sterility of the volume. The design was verified through a series of tests, including temperature and pH regulation, resterilizability, evaporation, cell viability and systems integration trials. Temperature, pH, resterilzability and evaporation tests yielded quantitative data; while the cell viability and systems integration tests compared cells from the Sterile Incubator Volume System to control cells (from a commercial incubator). These tests verified that the system can maintain cell viability for up to 4 hours; it follows that the allowable cell print time will increase, due to optimized conditions for the cells during deposition and experimentation. These trials found cell viability in the Sterile Incubator Volume System to be comparable to cells from the commercial incubator. This design is simple, autonomous, and can be integrated into most existing tissue engineering and cell culture experiments with minor changes. The potential for maintaining cell viability could be further enhanced by future developments, including humidity and carbon dioxide regulation, expanding the volume size, and creating additional print-head interface variations to increase the diversity of the printed assemblies. These potential enhancements must consider the design intent and simplicity. The design of this sterile incubator volume system is an important step in improving tissue engineering technology and the types of tissues that can be engineered...|$|R
