40|$|A non-back {{drivable}} mechanism (transmission or clutches) is {{a device}} able to transmit torques from its input to the output axis and vice-versa to <b>lock</b> <b>torques</b> applied to its output. These devices {{are widely used}} in robotic, mechatronic systems and prosthetics in order to lock joints or to physically engage/disengage transmission axes. An efficient way to implement non-back drivability is to exploit the wedge phenomenon that occurs to rolling elements when they are compressed between circular and cam surfaces. The current literature describing such mechanisms and underlying equations is rather scattered and incomplete. In this paper, a relevant set of equations is presented to optimize their design, which {{is of particular interest}} in prosthetics to minimize weight of limbs. The conceptual framework and the general design are described. The relationship between the <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> and the properties of the components are then derived. Moreover, the sources and effects of tolerance and of operational conditions are introduced. The contact pressures, the input torque required to unlock the clutch, the critical torque and the input backlash are finally analyzed. The final part of the paper is devoted to a step-by-step procedure useful in the design of non-back drivable roller clutches...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the nature}} of {{asynchronous}} and synchronous torques in a split-phase induction machine is investigated and quantified. The equivalent circuit {{for this type of}} machine is derived using the rotating field theory. It is extended to include harmonic effects. Using this model, winding harmonics and permeance harmonics may be calculated independently of each other so that the model can be used to analyse asynchronous torques from winding harmonics as well as synchronous torques from permeance harmonics. These are calculated separately. The asynchronous torques appear as perturbations in the steady-state torque-speed curve while the synchronous torques only appear at specific speeds. The synchronous torques are superimposed onto the torque-speed curves to model both effects together. The model predictions are compared against test results using purpose-built experimental machines together with production machines. These have varying rotor bar number and skew. Different methods are used to assess the synchronous torques. It is found that measuring synchronous <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> is not a straightforward matter; however, reasonable agreement is found between calculation and measurement. The work highlights the need for the correct choice of stator and rotor slot numbers together with the effect skew has on reducing the synchronous and asynchronous <b>locking</b> <b>torques.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Resonant field {{amplification}} or {{error field}} penetration involves driving a weakly stable tearing perturbation in a rotating toroidal plasma. In this paper it is {{shown that the}} locking characteristics for modes with finite real frequencies ω_r are {{quite different from the}} conventional results. A calculation of the tearing mode amplitude assuming modes with frequencies ±ω_r in the plasma frame shows that it is maximized when the frequency of the stable backward propagating mode (-ω_r) in the lab frame is zero, i. e. when v=ω_r/k. Even more importantly, the <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> is exactly zero at the mode phase velocity, with a pronounced peak at just higher rotation, leading to a locked state with plasma velocity v just above the mode phase velocity in the lab frame. Real frequencies ±ω_r, leading to a v→-v symmetry, are known to occur due to the Glasser effect [A. H. Glasser, J. M. Greene, and J. M. Johnson, Phys. Fluids 19, 567 (1976). ] for modes in the resistive-inertial (RI) regime. This therefore leads to locking of the plasma velocity to just above the phase velocity. It is also shown that similar real frequencies occur over a range of parameters in the visco-resistive (VR) regime with pressure, and the <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> is similar to that in the RI regime. Real frequencies occur due to diamagnetic effects in other tearing mode regimes and also show this effect, but without the v→-v symmetry. Nonlinear effects on the mode amplitude and torque for weakly stable modes or large error fields are discussed. Also, the possibility of applying external fields of different helicities to drive sheared flows in toroidal plasmas is discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

It was also the first Excalibur to have glass side windows, a trunk/boot integrated within the bodywork and an electrically operated soft-top for Roadster as well as Phaeton models. The chassis, especially unchanged relative to the SIII's, was nonetheless (and yet again) stretched, this time by 13 inches; now the Roadster had become a four-seater with rear electrically operated rumble-seat. The styling had also evolved a little. It still undeniably evoked vintage Mercedes, but this time emulated the 500/540K series rather than the SS/SSK. The series IV was obliged (by even more rigorous anti-pollution regulators) to take on yet another engine, a GM 5.0-liter (305 cu. in.) equipped with automatic transmission and a <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> converter. Once more the performance suffered, although the buying public seemed to be resigned to this and appeared more concerned with comfort and appointments than out-and-out dynamics.|$|R

A compact modular saddle coil set generates magnetic perturbations used to apply local torque to pre-existing m/n= 2 / 1 magnetic islands.

Factor of approximately 2 change in island frequency is observed during these magnetic stirring experiments with an applied radial saddle coil field {{of the order of}} the poloidal field fluctuation of the island measured {{at the edge of the}} plasma. To better quantify the coil-island interaction a simple cylindrical model of the electromagnetic, inertial, and viscous torque balance near a large amplitude magnetic island is developed and compared to experimental island frequency <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> requirements. The measured order of magnitude of the electromagnetic torque required to frequency lock HBT-EP islands is consistent with toroidally driven island motion by these rotating resonant magnetic perturbations.

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the <b>lock</b> <b>torque</b> tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Ultramatic did not switch automatically {{between high}} and low gearing ratios; the driver selected high or low ratio through the column shift lever. The intention was that in normal driving, the high (1:1) ratio would be selected at all times, and the two stage, dual turbine torque converter (actually a total of four turbines were employed) used to reduce gearing for starting off. At a speed of 15 - 56 mph (depending on rear axle ratio which affected the rate of governor pressure rise), governor pressure overcame the opposing throttle pressure, as determined by carburetor linkage position, causing the Direct Shift Valve to apply the direct drive clutch. This [...] "locked" [...] the torque converter, giving direct mechanical drive from the engine to the rear wheels, eliminating the power-robbing slippage of the torque converter at cruising speeds. On the highway, the Ultramatic delivered the same economy and power as a manual transmission.

50|$|Packard's {{successful}} {{development of}} its own automatic transmission was unique; no other independent (non-Big Three) automaker managed such a feat. The company's worsening situation throughout the 1950s, however, did not permit sufficient funds {{to keep up with}} the transmission development of the larger companies; Packard's attempts to update the Ultramatic were not sufficiently tested to iron out the problems, and those problems did damage to the company's reputation. Some automotive historians have argued that Packard should have dropped the Ultramatic after 1954, and purchased a more modern transmission design from another manufacturer but such opinions prove worthless when considering Packard's use of a <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> converter was not only up to date but ahead of its time. In addition, the only true new modern transmission to appear was the Dual Coupling Hydra-Matic but that did not appear until 1956 and had serious teething problems {{of its own}}. In retrospect Packard's Twin Ultramatic's most serious design flaw was during the low to high shift transition where a poorly timed high clutch application and low band release over much of the allowable upshift range resulted in many premature high clutch failures. This situation resulted in an unusual sensitivity to individual driving habits determining useful clutch life. Therefore, while this transmission was certainly designed to physically accept a high torque V8, its control system likely needed another year of development.|$|R

40|$|The {{product range}} of the rail vehicle {{industry}} comprises the construction of railroad material for long-distance and short-distance transport. This includes, for example, locomotives and cars, subway, light railway and tramway cars as well as rail vehicle equipment. The development of the industry {{is determined by the}} demand for transport services and government actions for the extension of railways and procurement of suitable vehicle types. In contrast to road vehicles, differential gears are only used in a negligible percentage of rail vehicles. Primarily in the short-distance rail transport sector, the demand for differential gears is growing due to increased drive power, smaller wheel diameters, lower vehicle mass with higher load capacity, the introduction of low-floor technology as well as the requirement of employing ever more quiet vehicles. In hydrostatic self-locking differential gears, oil is supplied to the gears within the differential gearbox. They only rotate relative to each other when the differential gear performs a compensation movement. In this case, oil is transported in the tooth space to the meshing of the gears, where it is displaced due to the meshing and must drain through tight gaps. The pressure generated by this process acts against the compensation movement of the gear, and the drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that has the higher friction. The achievable <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> is linearly dependent on the differential speed of the drive wheel. This locking effect is achieved without wear-prone components and works automatically without active external intervention. The design space required corresponds to that of conventional differential gears, as the locking effect is integrated in the existing design. (orig.)

50|$|For {{driving in}} {{particularly}} challenging conditions, such as snow, the driver can select “4WD Lock” mode. In Lock mode, the system still apportions {{front and rear}} torque automatically, but enables greater power transfer to the rear wheels. In dry conditions, 4WD Lock mode places priority on performance. More torque is directed to the rear wheels than in 4WD Auto mode to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds. Rear wheel torque transfer is increased by 50 percent over the amounts in 4WD Auto mode - meaning up to 60 percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration on dry pavement.

50|$|The manual {{transmission}} couples {{the engine to}} the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the torque converter on an automatic transmission or the v-belt of a continuously variable transmission, which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the parasitic power consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Because of this, {{manual transmission}}s generally offer better fuel economy than automatic or continuously variable transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset {{with the introduction of}} <b>locking</b> <b>torque</b> converters on automatic transmissions. Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent automatic transmission vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving. The lack of control over downshifting under load in an automatic transmission, coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher load, can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of automatic transmissions by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than automatic transmissions, they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in stop-and-go traffic. However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid to higher end model automatic cars now get better economy than their standard spec counterparts. This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using different automatic technology such as CVT and Dual-Clutch Automatics.|$|R
