5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky of Shizontania {{the night before the}} knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E

25|$|Folk {{beliefs that}} cats can cause strange {{phenomena}} {{are not limited}} to Japan. For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, it is said that a cat, after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching them. Because it is said that cats with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since it is said that their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, it is said that when a cat <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, it should be killed on the spot.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the verses}} in Ezekiel and its {{attendant}} commentaries, his vision consists of a chariot made of many heavenly beings driven by the [...] "Likeness of a Man." [...] The base structure of the chariot is composed of four beings. These beings are called the [...] "living creatures" [...] (Hebrew: חיות hayyot or khayyot). The bodies of the creatures are [...] "like that of a human being", but each of them has four faces, corresponding to the four directions the chariot can go (East, South, North and West). The faces are that of a man, a lion, an ox (later changed to a cherub in Ezekiel [...] ) and an eagle. Since there are four angels and each has four faces, there are a total of sixteen faces. Each [...] "Hayyot" [...] angel also has four wings. Two of these wings spread across {{the length of the}} chariot and connect with the wings of the angel on the other side. This creates a sort of 'box' of wings that forms the perimeter of the chariot. With the remaining two wings, each angel covers its own body. Below, but not attached to, the feet of the [...] "Hayyot" [...] angels are other angels that are shaped like wheels. These wheel angels, which are described as [...] "a wheel inside of a wheel", are called [...] "Ophanim" [...] אופנים (lit. wheels, cycles or ways).
