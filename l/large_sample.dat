5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E

5|$|The art {{historian}} Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved {{the myth that}} Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly in the old men's almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed {{that the person who}} died there was in fact Ruisdael's cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672. His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; Rembrandt ranks first.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} quality of replications, <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> sizes than those used in the {{original}} study are often needed. <b>Larger</b> <b>sample</b> sizes are needed because estimates of effect sizes in published work are often exaggerated due to publication bias and <b>large</b> <b>sampling</b> variability associated with small sample sizes in an original study.

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E

25|$|Guidelines for {{assigning}} authorship vary between {{institutions and}} disciplines. They may be formally defined or simply cultural custom.

A 2002 survey of a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> of researchers who had received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health revealed that 10% of respondents claimed to have inappropriately assigned authorship credit within the last three years. This was the first large scale survey concerning such issues. In other fields only limited or no empirical data is available.|$|E
25|$|In 1810, {{after reading}} Gauss's work, Laplace, after proving the central limit theorem, {{used it to}} give a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> {{justification}} for the method of least square and the normal distribution.

This result is known as the Gauss–Markov theorem.|$|E
25|$|The offline combustion/reduction has {{the highest}} {{accuracy}} and precision for hydrogen isotope measurement without limits for sample types.

The analytic cohort consisted of 291,988 men and 197,623 women aged 50–71 years. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995–1996; 2,974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during five years of follow-up. The result was that total fiber intake {{was not associated with}} colorectal cancer. But on the other hand, the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Corn sampled in 2000 {{from the}} Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico {{contained}} a transgenic 35S promoter, while a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> {{taken by a}} different method from the same region in 2003 and 2004 did not.

A 2009 study found recombinant proteins in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, most commonly in southeast Mexico. Seed and grain import from the United States could explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico, {{but not in the}} southeast. Also, 5.0% of corn seed lots in Mexican corn stocks expressed recombinant proteins despite the moratorium on GM crops.|$|E
25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since one can tell the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E

25|$|One {{study was}} based on the many Troodon teeth that have been {{collected}} from Late Cretaceous deposits from northern Alaska. These teeth are much larger than those collected from more southern sites, providing evidence that northern Alaskan populations of Troodon grew to larger average body size. The study suggests that the Alaskan Troodons may have had access to large animals as prey because there were no tyrannosaurids in their habitat to provide competition for those resources. This study also provides an analysis of the proportions and wear patterns of a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> of Troodon teeth. It proposes that the wear patterns of all Troodon teeth suggest a diet of soft foods - inconsistent with bone chewing, invertebrate exoskeletons, or tough plant items. This study hypothesizes a diet primarily consisting of meat.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked at the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> sizes to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, by 1932, Szent-Györgyi {{had moved}} to Hungary. By that point he knew that hexanuric acid was present in large amounts in citrus, where it {{prevented}} oxidation of polyphenols, but where {{it was difficult to}} extract because of the other sugars naturally present there. After being fed a meal of paprika peppers — a common spice and food in the Hungarian diet — Szent-Györgyi was inspired to assay it for hexuronic acid, and found it present in large amounts without the contaminating sugars from sweeter plants. With a plentiful source of the pure vitamin, Szent-Györgyi now sent a <b>large</b> <b>sample</b> to noted British sugar chemist Walter Norman Haworth, who chemically identified it as L-hexuronic acid and then proved the identification by total synthesis in 1933. Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed that the substance L-hexuronic acid be called a-scorbic acid, and chemically L-ascorbic acid, in honor of its activity against scurvy. Ascorbic acid {{turned out not to be}} an amine, nor even to contain any nitrogen. In part, in recognition of his accomplishment with vitamin C, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the unshared 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Haworth also shared that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in part for his vitamin C synthetic work.|$|E
