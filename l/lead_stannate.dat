The pigment is opaque and lightfast. It is also highly poisonous due to the lead component.|$|E
40|$|The {{generally}} accepted {{theory is that}} the demand for Islamic glazed pottery started in Abbasid Iraq in the 9 th century AD with the production of a range of glazed wares in response to the import of Chinese stonewares and porcelains. However, Oliver Watson has recently proposed that the demand for Islamic glazed pottery first occurred in Egypt and Syria in the 8 th century AD resulting in the production of opaque yellow decorated wares. Using a combination of SEM analysis of polished cross-sections, and surface analysis using hand-held XRF or PIXE, Coptic Glazed Ware from Egypt, Yellow Glazed Ware from Syria, and comparable wares from Samarra, Kish and Susa have been analysed. The analyses show that the opaque yellow decoration was the result of <b>lead</b> <b>stannate</b> particles in a high lead glaze, which it is suggested was produced using a lead-silica-tin mixture. The use of <b>lead</b> <b>stannate</b> in the production of yellow opaque glazes is explained in terms of technological transfer from contemporary Islamic glassmakers who continued the Byzantine tradition of glassmaking. It is further argued that the introduction of opaque yellow glazed pottery into Mesopotamia could have provided the social context for the sudden emergence of tin-opacified white glazed pottery in Abbasid Iraq in the 9 th century AD. However, in view of the very different glaze compositions employed for the yellow and white opaque glazes, it seems probable that the white tin-opacified glazes used for Abbasid cobalt blue and lustre decorated wares represent a separate but parallel technological tradition with its origins in the production of Islamic opaque white glass.

40|$|Cuneiform tablets {{tell the}} life and culture of Sumerian people {{in a sort of}} black and white tale because of the binary {{engraving}} technique. A leading question arises: did Mesopotamian people apply some kind of colour to decorate their tablets or to put emphasis on selected words? Some administrative and literary Sumerian cuneiform tablets of mid-third Millennium B. C. from the site of Kish (central Mesopotamia, modern Iraq) were dug up in twentieth-century and stored at the Ashmolean Museum of the Oxford University. Non-destructive micro-Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to detect the presence of residual pigments eventually applied to the engraving signs. Yellow, orange, red and white pigments have been detected and a possible identification has been proposed in this work. In particular yellow pigments are identified as Crocoite (PbCrO 4), <b>Lead</b> <b>stannate</b> (Pb 2 SnO 4); red pigments − hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and cuprite (Cu 2 O); White pigments − Lead carbonate (PbCO 3), calcium phosphate (Ca 3 (PO 4) 2), titanium dioxide (TiO 2), gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O); orange pigment a composition of red and yellow compounds. These results suggest that Sumerian people invented a new editorial style, to overcome the binary logic of engraving process and catch the reader’s eye by decorating cuneiform tablets. Finally, the coloured rendering of the tablet in their original view is proposed...|$|E

30|$|The white, yellow, {{and green}} enamels present {{relatively}} homogeneous microstructure: the constituent compounds {{seem to have}} largely reacted together, suggesting these colors were prepared as pre-fritted enamels. The presence of unreacted quartz, feldspars, and cubic lead–tin yellow particles confirms {{the hypothesis that the}} yellow enamel was produced starting with a frit made by mixing glass raw materials with lead and tin oxides. When melted together in presence of silicates, lead and tin oxides form the cubic form of lead–tin yellow [28, 29]. The green enamel, also exhibiting cubic lead–tin yellow particles, was produced in the same way, but {{with the addition of a}} copper source. However, the green enamel was probably made with a higher silica content or heated at a higher temperature than the yellow, leading to the recrystallization of the cassiterite particles [29] observed in the green matrix. In the white enamel, the micrometric size of homogeneously distributed cassiterite particles combined with the presence of significant lead content in the matrix support the hypothesis that the white enamel was pre-fritted, allowing for the recrystallization of cassiterite particles. The firing of the PbO–SnO 2 –SiO 2 system allows tin oxide to react forming a <b>lead</b> <b>stannate</b> intermediary phase and, if heated to sufficient temperature, to recrystallize as finer particles of cassiterite, which provide increased opacity as compared to unreacted cassiterite [29, 30]. The higher proportion of soda-lime-silica glass and lower lead oxide content found in the white enamel, as opposed to the yellow and green, allow cassiterite recrystallization to occur at a lower temperature.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of archaeometric {{characterisation}} of the tesserae, intentionally coloured with or without copper- or tin-based opacifiers, in the palaeo-Christian glass mosaic of St. Prosdocimus in Padova. In particular, 54 tesserae belonging to colour types Orange, Red, Brown, Green, Blue and Yellow are examined here. The multi-methodological approach (SEM-EDS, EMPA, XRPD, imaging spectroscopy in some cases coupled with XAS) gave valuable insights into the complex technologies behind palaeo-Christian glass mosaic production, with identification of various glassy matrixes typical of both Roman and Late Roman periods, and of opacifiers, both crystallised in situ (e. g., metallic copper and cuprite) and ex situ (e. g., cassiterite and <b>lead</b> <b>stannate)</b> and colourants (mainly iron, manganese and copper), all variously mixed {{in order to obtain}} the desired shades. In addition, the combination of all textural, chemical, diffractometric and spectroscopic data allows us to hypothesise that all the tesserae, used to decorate the Paduan chapel, were produced in the 6 th century AD. This is because each chromatic group examined here reveals at least one technical feature typical of the 6 th century and, in this context, the type of glassy matrix and/or opacifier used turns out to be particularly discriminatory. In particular, tesserae with copper-based opacifiers (cuprite and metallic copper), although the latter had been used from the Bronze Age onwards, are all characterised by the matrixes typical of the Late Roman period; tesserae with tin-based opacifiers are characterised by matrixes typical of both Roman and Late Roman periods and by opacifiers, which was not systematically used before the 4 th century. However, the close compositional, textural and technological similarities of the tesserae from each chromatic group, particularly evident into those with tin-based opacifiers, is consistent with a small number of specialised workshops and skilled workers. Peculiar relationships among the oxidation states of colouring elements, their contents in the matrix, the type of opacifiers used, and the final colour of the tesserae were all identified. The correlations between copper and other associated elements (e. g., tin, zinc, antimony, iron), together with micro-textural observations, allow inferences regarding possible sources. Technological connections between Padova and Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine mosaic production in Italy, were documented, although in the case of orange tesserae good chemical correspondence was also identified with the Near East. Lastly, soda ash identified in Opaque Red and Orange tesserae are indicative of Medieval restoration...|$|E

The property of reverse switching from the field-induced ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phases is studied as a function of temperature, applied electric field, and sample thickness in antiferroelectric lead zirconate thin films deposited by pulsed excimer laser ablation. The maximum released charge density was 22 μC/cm 2 from a stored charge density of 36 μC/cm 2 in a 0. 55 μ thick lead zirconate thin film. This indicated that more than 60 % of the stored charge could be released in less than 7 ns at room temperature for a field of 200 kV/cm. The content of net released charge was found to increase with increasing field strength, whereas with increasing temperature the released charge was found to decrease.

Effects of oxygen pressure during deposition were studied, with emphasis placed on the electrical and dielectric properties of the films. The dielectric constant and the maximum polarization increased with the oxygen pressure during deposition, from 75 to 125 mTorr. So did the dielectric strength. This property enhancement with deposition oxygen pressure {{was believed to be}} due to the reduction of pyrochlore phase in the films. However, increasing the oxygen pressure beyond 150 mTorr during deposition had led to the increase of surface roughness, which eventually resulted in film cracking.

Furthermore, three advantages of PLZST AFE ceramics for pulse discharge can be determined: a large increase rate of Imax due the field-forced AFE-FE phase transition, a great enhanced power density and a relatively short discharge period time.

40|$|The {{technique}} of Raman spectroscopy {{was used in}} a study of shards of known (Ming and Meissen) and unknown (archaeological) origin. A tile shard from the Citadel of Algiers was included in this study as further confirmation of the consistency of the methods that are developed. The Citadel from which the tile shard was obtained was built in 1516 and represents a landmark from pre-colonial Algeria. The results were compared with those obtained from studies on intact museum pieces of known (Ming) origin. A consistent method of studying underglaze pigments on glazed ceramic artifacts by directing the laser beam through the predominantly silicate glaze was developed. The glaze depth profiling method developed proved to be very useful in the analysis and gives not only a detailed composition for the glaze/ceramic interfacial pigment, but also the order in which the various interfacial pigment layers were applied at the time of manufacture. The information acquired leads {{to an understanding of the}} level of technological development of the manufacturers. The detailed study and characterisation of the pigments that were analysed in this way gives insight into trade relations among ancient societies of the Mediterranean and will also assist archaeologists in establishing cut-off dates for the archaeological sites from which the artifacts were recovered. All the shards, except one from Meissen (Germany), were provided by the National Cultural History Museum of South Africa and the intact Ming dynasty plates were provided by the J. A. van Tilburg Museum of the University of Pretoria. The tile shard sample from the Citadel of Algiers was donated for the study. The results indicate that none of the archaeological shards could possibly be of Ming dynasty origin based on, firstly, the use of amorphous carbon to darken the cobalt blue (CoAl 2 O 4) used as decoration on the shards, and secondly on the use of white (synthetic) anatase to whiten the ceramic surface before the application of the pigment since this synthetic anatase is known to have been manufactured for the first time around 1920. An ancient rediscovered ternary pigment (Pb 2 SnSbO 6. 5) previously found on Italian paintings of the 16 th century, for example, “Lot and his daughters” by G. B. Langetti and “Entrance of Christ in Jerusalem” by Luca Giordano, was identified on the Citadel tile and successfully characterised. A Pb-O vibrational Raman band at 127 cm- 1 for this pigment was assigned for the first time. Additional pigments identified on the tile include Naples yellow (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7), <b>lead</b> (II) <b>stannate</b> (Pb 2 SnO 4), cobalt blue (CoAl 2 O 4) and cassiterite (SnO 2). The bulk of the tile body is composed mainly of hematite (á-Fe 2 O 3), maghemite (ã-Fe 2 O 3), magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and quartz (á-SiO 2), with traces of calcite (CaCO 3) and amorphous carbon. The unique non destructive depth profiling method that was developed in this study can now be applied to the study of underglaze pigments on intact porcelain artifacts in museums and private collections around the world for authentication purposes and for comparison with archaeological shard samples.
