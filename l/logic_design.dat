We investigate and compare our proposed and the existing secure adiabatic logic {{across a range of}} “power-clock” frequencies on the basis of percentage Normalized Energy Deviation (%NED), percentage Normalized Standard Deviation(%NSD) and average energy dissipation. The pre-layout and post-layout simulation results show that our proposed logic exhibits the least value of %NED and %NSD in comparison to the existing secure adiabatic <b>logic</b> <b>designs</b> at the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} Without Charge Sharing Quasi Adiabatic Logic (WCS-QuAL) as a {{countermeasure}} against Power Analysis Attacks. We evaluate and compare our logic with the recently proposed secure adiabatic <b>logic</b> <b>designs</b> SPGAL and EE-SPFAL at frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz. Simulation {{results show that}} WCS-QuAL outperforms the existing secure adiabatic <b>logic</b> <b>designs</b> {{on the basis of}} % Normalized Energy Deviation (NED) and % Normalized Standard Deviation (NSD) at all simulated frequencies. Also, all 2 -input gates using WCS-QuAL dissipate nearly equal energy for all possible input transitions. In addition, the energy dissipated by WCS-QuAL approaches to the energy dissipation of EESPFAL and SPGAL as the output load capacitance is increased above 100 fF. To further evaluate and compare the performance, GF (24) bit-parallel multiplier was implemented as a design example. The impact of Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variations, power supply scaling and technology on the performance of the three <b>logic</b> <b>designs</b> was investigated and compared. Simulation results show that WCS-QuAL passed the functionality test against PVT variations and can perform well against the power supply scaling (from 1. 8 V to 0. 5 V). It also exhibits the least value of %NED and %NSD against PVT variations and when the power supply is scaled down compared to EE-SPFAL and SPGAL. At lower technology, WCS-QuAL, shows more improvement in energy dissipation than EE-SPFAL...|$|R
