40|$|The {{definition}} of “expert performance ” is obviously vital to any analysis of expertise. If external standards exist, then the definition is straightforward: the correct answers determine expert performance. Unfortunately, external standards seldom exist in domains requiring expertise; {{that is why}} experts are needed in the first place. The purposes of this paper are (1) to review traditional methods for defining expert performance {{in the absence of}} external standards and (2) to present a promising new approach for assessing expert performance (labeled CWS for Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau). Eight traditional procedures are reviewed, along with discussions of their advantages and disadvantages. Then CWS is presented along with a technical elaboration. The CWS approach is illustrated through reanalyses of three previous studies of experts. A study of physicians revealed that expert diagnostic skill was related to both discrimination and consistency – the two components of CWS. In a study of agricultural judges, the sensitivity of CWS was demonstrated by its ability to distinguish between <b>livestock</b> <b>judges</b> with different subspecialties. In a study of auditors, CWS correctly linked group differences in expertise (experts vs. novices) to information relevance. These reanalyses demonstrate that CWS offers new insights into the nature of expertise.
