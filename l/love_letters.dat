5|$|Donen's final {{television}} film was the made-for-TV movie <b>Love</b> <b>Letters,</b> which aired on ABC in April 1999. The film starred Steven Weber and Laura Linney and {{was based on}} the play by A.R. Gurney. Weber plays a successful US Senator who finds out that his long lost love (Linney) has recently died. The two had only corresponded through mail over the years, and Weber remembers Linney through his collection of old <b>love</b> <b>letters.</b> Donen had wanted to make a theatrical film version of the play, but was unable to secure financing from any major studio and instead took the project to ABC. In 2002 Donen directed Elaine May's musical play Adult Entertainment starring Danny Aiello and Jeannie Berlin in Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation.

Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court.

Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E
5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land sales pitch, {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his interest in her daughter. She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of <b>love</b> <b>letters</b> had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of <b>love</b> <b>letters</b> to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E
50|$|Trying {{to profit}} from the situation, Scapin goes to Argentine and shows her the <b>love</b> <b>letter,</b> saying that Arlequin gave it to another woman.

5|$|Bembo's italic is {{not based}} {{directly}} {{on the work of}} Griffo, but on the work of calligrapher and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio). He published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing, in Venice in 1524, after the time of Manutius and Griffo, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. (Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting, but also self-help guides on learning to read, arithmetic, embroidery and a book of model <b>love</b> <b>letters.)</b> It too was imitated in France, with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards. Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, also a calligrapher who became involved in printing. His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth-century font designs.|$|E

5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is quite {{different}} from the despondent and plaintive <b>love</b> <b>letters</b> she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
