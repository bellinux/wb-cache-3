5000|$|The {{pattern of}} {{electric}} and magnetic fields {{at the mouth}} of a parabolic antenna is simply a scaled up image of the fields radiated by the feed antenna, so the polarization is determined by the feed antenna. In order to achieve maximum gain, the feed antenna in the transmitting and receiving antenna must have the same polarization. [...] For example, a vertical dipole feed antenna will radiate a beam of radio waves with their electric field vertical, called vertical polarization. The receiving feed antenna must also have vertical polarization to receive them; if the feed is horizontal (horizontal polarization) the antenna will suffer a severe <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The helix in {{the antenna}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions: right-handed or left-handed, {{as defined by}} the right-hand rule. In an axial-mode helical antenna the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the radio waves. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarised radiation it emits cannot be stated without ambiguity. Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarised signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E

In a network with N sources, the developed protocol can achieve throughput up to approximately 1 /N symbols per source per channel use, as well as diversity of order N.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{investigated}} {{the relation between}} insulin and coronary atherosclerosis and restenosis of the coronary arteries, by performing elective {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). Background. Insulin is known to promote atherosclerosis of the arteries and has been implicated in the development of restenosis after PTCA. Methods. Of 210 angina patients who underwent PTCA, newly detected lesions in 35 consecutive nondiabetic subjects without previous intervention on the same main coronary arteries were analyzed after a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and follow-up coronary angiography. Atherosclerotic lesions were evaluated by pattern, severity and extent. Restenosis was defined as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gain,</b> the percentage of loss of the initial gain in the coronary diameter achieved by PTCA ≥ 50 %. Results. Patients with restenosis had a significantly higher extent index (a marker of atherosclerosis), insulin area, ratio of insulin area to glucose area, insulinogenic index and minimal lumen diameter after PTCA than those without restenosis (p = 0. 001, 0. 011, 0. 002, 0. 016 and 0. 041, respectively). Simple regression analysis revealed that only the ratio of insulin area to glucose area (a relative marker of enhanced insulin secretion) significantly correlated with the extent index (p = 0. 035). Extent index, insulin area, the ratio of insulin area to glucose area and insulinogenic index significantly correlated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gain</b> (p = 0. 001, 0. 010, 0. 002 and 0. 032, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that extent index and the ratio of insulin area to glucose area significantly correlated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>gain.</b> Conclusions. Enhanced secretion of insulin during the OGTT might be useful as a predictor of coronary atherosclerosis and of restenosis after elective PTCA in nondiabetic patients with effort angina...|$|E
