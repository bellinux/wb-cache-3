50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a groove, over <b>locating</b> <b>pins,</b> or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lens mount}} is not {{identical}} across all variants, thus {{there is a}} marked difference between a BNC and BNCR mount, for instance. BNCR is only the current convention {{as it was the}} last version of the camera and in relatively current use through until the 1990s. The mount contains four pronged flanges only one of which contains a notch towards the center. This notch is used to align the mount to a <b>locating</b> <b>pin</b> <b>located</b> approximately 45 degrees clockwise {{from the top of the}} camera's lens mount. This radial indexing is of particular importance when shooting an anamorphic format (CinemaScope or Panavision, or equivalent). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring which, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. The quality of this design has been a key influence in the design of the Arri PL and Panavision PV mounts, both of which are the main film camera mounts in use today, and both of which have four-pronged flanges oriented based on locating pin-notch combinations. The Arri PL mount in particular is very similar in appearance to the BNCR mount, the only immediately apparent difference being the ability to seat any of the four notched prongs against the <b>locating</b> <b>pin.</b> (The flange focal distance and diameter also differ.) ...|$|R

40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} with ultrahigh precision motion {{are being}} increasingly used for several applications including micromeasurement, micro/nanomanipulation, microfabri-cation, and so on. Flexure linkages offer inherent advantages of being frictionless, highly repeatable, and having great design flexibility. Monolithic fabrication of these mecha-nisms limits {{the use of}} multiple materials for optimized design and is expensive or infeasi-ble especially for three-dimensional mechanisms. An alternative method of assembling components of a compliant mechanism is considered in this paper and design for assem-bly guidelines are put forth. It is found that if each of the connections of a compliant mechanism is constrained exactly using two pins as per the traditional practice, internal stresses are generated in the links and their warping does not allow the desired operation of the mechanism. The proposed guidelines, which are based on Grubler’s criteria, include a simple formulation to determine number of <b>locating</b> <b>pins</b> {{to be used in the}} entire assembly. Further, these guidelines also determine the locations of these pins. Several compliant mechanisms were fabricated and assembled using these guidelines and were found to be working satisfactorily.

40|$|In {{machining}} process, fixture {{is used to}} {{keep the}} position and orientation of a workpiece with respect to machine tool frame. However, the workpiece always cannot be at its ideal position because of the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of the locators, clamping force, cutting force, and so on.

This paper presents a prediction model of a workpiece locating error caused by the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of locaters for the fixtures with one locating surface and two <b>locating</b> <b>pins.</b> Error parameters along {{6 degrees of freedom}} can be calculated by the proposed model and then compensated by either using the “frame transformation” function of a numerical control (NC) system or modifying NC codes in post-processing. In addition, machining error caused by the workpiece locating error can be predicted based on a multi-body system and homogeneous transfer matrix. This is meaningful to fixture design and machining process planning. Finally, a cutting test has shown that the proposed method is practicable and effective...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 28 The two subject blowers {{operate in}} {{parallel}} to circulate wet chlorine gas. Both units had large synchronous vibrations {{that led to}} multiple bearing failures. After simple rotordynamic studies failed to identify the problem, a comprehensive model that accounted for both the motor and blower was successful at identifying the problem as high sensitivity to unbalance loads due to an extremely lightly-loaded (less than one pound) condition at the blower?s inboard bearing (refer to Gutzwiller and Corbo, 2011). Based {{on the results of}} the rotordynamic analysis, two changes were made to both units. The couplings were changed from disk to gear couplings, and the blower?s bearings were changed from plain cylindrical to tilting-pad designs. After implementing these changes, unit ?A? ran smoothly for a period of six weeks, in accordance with the predictions of the rotordynamic analysis, and it appeared to all that the problem was completely solved. However, when the ?B? blower was then started up the two machines then commenced a three month period of operation in which each suffered from intermittent periods of high synchronous vibrations. During this time, the following behavior traits, which {{can only be described as}} bizarre, were observed: 1. 	After a smooth startup, vibration increased to a high level after about one week. 2. 	The transition from low vibrations to high vibrations was almost instantaneous. Additionally, this transition was always accompanied by an axial motion of the blower rotor away from the active thrust bearing. 3. 	The units appeared to be more likely to suffer high vibrations when both were running simultaneously. 4. 	Starting one machine might result in increased vibrations on the other, and shutting down a machine might lower vibrations on the other. 5. 	Someone observed that during a rainstorm the vibration levels decreased. (Note: the blowers are located outside.) Spraying water on the bearings sometimes (but not always) had a similar effect. A task force of experts was then commissioned and an extensive troubleshooting effort commenced. Some of the potential root causes that were hypothesized included blower surging, starvation of the tilting-pad bearings, thermally-induced misalignment, insufficient blower thrust, acoustic resonance, axial vibration, seal rubbing, and Morton effects. After an extensive troubleshooting effort that included more rotordynamic analysis, bearing flow analysis, blower thrust analysis, and extensive studying of orbit plots, spectrum plots, and vibration and temperature histories, the task force concluded that the most likely cause was rubbing at the blower?s carbon ring seal. Accordingly, the seal was disassembled and its <b>locating</b> <b>pins</b> were found to have come loose and generated a rub. Design changes were then implemented to provide better retention for the pins. The units were then restarted and it was verified that the modifications had finally eliminated the vibration problems. This paper shows how the combination of rotordynamic analysis and troubleshooting skills was employed to identify and generate corrective actions for two independent causes of high synchronous vibrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{final product}} {{functionality}} of parts produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) can, in part, {{be improved by}} the inclusion of multi-material capabilities. The “Multi 3 D system” that is under development at The University of Texas at El Paso uses material extrusion printing (or fused deposition modeling), solid conductor wire embedding, direct-write, component placement, and micromaching to enable multi-material fabrication. The Multi 3 D was designed to transport a workpiece between manufacturing stations via a six-axis robot, portable build platform (PBP), and a controlled temperature environment or chamber that travels to each manufacturing station. The heated travel envelope (HTE) was included to mitigate thermal shrinkage (and eventually warping) that occurs when a thermoplastic is subjected to a decrease in temperature {{within a short time}} frame. An end-effector was also designed to allow the six-axis robot to interact and handle the PBP and HTE. Discussed in this work is the design and construction of the HTE as well as its performance in terms of maintaining a stable temperature while considering the imposed weight and dimensional constraints. The HTE design includes a compressible high temperature bellow “door” which allows it slide over builds and increases the height of builds (~ 22 cm) which can be produced in the Multi 3 D system. The HTE is capable of maintaining a 150 ± 8 °C environment with its convective heating system, which is the baseline set for building parts with polycarbonate, specifically 145 °C. The temperature change (drop) of parts is reduced by 71 % with the inclusion of HTE in the transportation process. The quantified temperature drop without the HTE during transportation was approximately 21 °C in comparison to 6 °C with the HTE. The construction and performance (e. g., locating accuracy) of the PBP are also discussed. The PBP was designed around the “Platen” build platform to replicate its abilities but in a form that allows it to be portable. The PBP is able to receive vacuum (- 42. 3 ± 8. 5 KPa) supply for restraining sacrificial build sheets in two forms, from the station of the Multi 3 D system it is placed in and from the end-effector. The PBP locates accurately into the FDM system, in a form that maintains the FDM’s achievable accuracy of ± 38 ?m, via the use of three <b>locating</b> <b>pins</b> and its vacuum fitting. The locating accuracy of the PBP was determined by printing “stair step” parts which were analyzed for layer shifting. These results were compared to stair steps printed in an unmodified FDM system as a control. The layer shifting was measured to be + 50. 8 to - 38. 1 ?m for non-paused builds and + 63. 5 to - 50. 8 ?m for paused builds on both machines (modified and control). This gave indication that the modifications done to the FDM machine and the portable build platform had no direct effect on the achievable accuracy in parts with this specific geometry and these processing conditions. Ultimately, the Multi 3 D system will be utilized for Aerospace applications to manufacture components for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, but other applications where disparate materials are required can be envisioned. This can be accomplished with these components or subsystems which were developed for material handling within the system. ...|$|E

The design of bogie bolster wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons. The long, but relatively lightweight, bogie bolster replaced this with a single wagon.|$|R
