40|$|According to {{the author}} {{concentration}} means, on the one hand, accumulation of production on definite building sites or particular objects, or on the other hand, accumulation of highly specialized production of certain assortments in large enterprises possessing the latest technics and major conversion power, permitting production development on a large scale. The main purpose of concentration in building {{is to reduce the}} investment cycles by limiting the number of investments simultaneously executed. The widely applied principles of concentration in building permit rapid transference of production potential, its fuller utilization and therefore more effective execution of investment. Measures of concentration in building are: size of building-installation enterprises, mean conversion on building sites, areal distribution of building sites in a given time, specialization in production and technical equipment of <b>live</b> <b>labour.</b> In conclusion the author considers the effects of concentrated building production expresses firstly in a shortened investment cycle and consequently earlier utilization, increased specialization and advisability of large building enterprises.

40|$|The buyer's {{market is}} mostly {{defined as a}} {{situation}} in which the supply exceeds the demand. Recent works introduce to this notion a new moment, that of a constant influence exerted by buyers on suppliers. The degree of the buyer's influence on the activities of various links of the transaction chain — especially those which are situated close to consumption — is of considerable importance. In the exchange process such a situation exists in regard to the majority of small producers. Therefore it seems justified to undertake an analysis of the function of small producers' sector as an element of the buyer's market. In the system of socialist economy the creation of that sector is based on social as well as economic premises. There are fundamental differences (in size, employment, technical equipment, volume of production a. s. o.) between centrally administered enterprises and the small producers' enterprises. The short series of production and its individualization are propitious to the elasticity of supplies, allowing for an easier adaptation to the changing and evermore diversified demand. All this is possible due to greater share of <b>live</b> <b>labour</b> than that of capital equipment in machines and tools and finally to more universal qualifications of workers. The greater part of goods and a substantial part of services of the sector of small producers are bought directly or indirectly by population. Thus the circle of buyers as well as of sellers is an important one — what in turn constitutes the premise of that particular market. The multitude of sellers (producers) in strictly defined conditions inclines to competition in the field of quality of goods and services and also in respect with prices. The sector of small producers is closely tied to the organs of the regional national councils. That subordination facilitates rational administration, the development of regional economy and the functioning of the regional and local market.

MacDonald was likewise opposed {{to the terms of}} the Versailles Treaty, and sought to mollify them in his first brief period as Prime Minister of the short <b>lived</b> <b>Labour</b> government in 1924. Bennett was also friendly with Philip Snowden, who became godfather to Bennett's eldest son. When MacDonald formed a new government in 1929, Snowden became his Chancellor of Exchequer. In 1931, the economic situation had deteriorated significantly. The cabinet was split on how to address the situation. MacDonald supported further austerity, and unable to carry his Labour party on the issue, he was asked by the King to lead a National coalition government with the Liberals and Conservatives.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the diverse body of {{seafarers}} from the Indian Ocean region known as “lascars”.

Private voyage journals and other sources offer scattered glimpses of demonstrations, strikes, and assaults on officers. Lascars used such tactics to air grievances, resist unpopular orders, and extract concessions from their superiors. They also took part in more serious forms of mutiny, in which they murdered captains, commandeered ships, and expropriated cargoes. The depositions taken in connection with such incidents provide an unparalleled window on to their working <b>lives.</b> <b>Labour</b> intermediaries known as serangs and tindals feature prominently in these various disturbances. The unique position they occupied enabled them to undermine European officers and even depose captains.

40|$|The {{precarious}} {{labour relations}} characterised by sex work are increasingly reflected by {{conditions in the}} wider labour market. As such and despite being viewed as ‘atypical workers’, the experiences of sex workers are more typical than has been previously recognised. This thesis explores the <b>lives,</b> <b>labour</b> and organising efforts of sex workers in the Asociación de Mujeres Meretrices de la Argentina (Argentinean Female Sex Workers’ Union - AMMAR). In exploring the organising strategies developed by AMMAR, the thesis {{highlights the importance of}} relationality, intimacy and emotion in reinvigorating workers’ organisation. The research foregrounds the concepts of ‘affective organising’ and ‘inclusive unionism’ as fundamental to building successful organisations of workers at the margins society and the economy. In the context of increasing precariousness and informalisation of work, this thesis argues that there are also lessons for the wider labour movement. The research draws on a questionnaire survey of 297 sex workers, 108 in-depth interviews with union and non-union sex workers, union leadership, politicians and civil society actors, as well as ethnographic observations in the union and within the spaces of street sex work. Questionnaires were undertaken in ten cities and further qualitative research was conducted in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Paraná and La Plata. Using these methods and working in alliance with sex worker activists, the thesis develops a methodology based on ‘dialogic collaboration’. This approach emphasises the importance of relationship building, responsibility and solidarity in research design and implementation in order that more mutual relations between North and South become possible.
