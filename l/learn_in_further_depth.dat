Owing to efforts of investigators and elevated levels of technologies, our knowledge on the mechanisms of plant salinity tolerance is dramatically expanding these days. However, individual plant species exhibits distinct salt sensitivity due to morphological differences and the difference in the ability of protection components that the plant has evolved to depend on. Therefore, challenges to elucidate the roles/significances of protection mechanisms in plant salt tolerance including morphological barriers at molecular, cellular and whole plant levels <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>depth</b> will be crucial to develop high-yielding salt-tolerant cultivars.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of a brief reading of the {{well-known}} poem ‘Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood’, Stanley Cavell cites Wordsworth’s emphasis (in the preface to Lyrical Ballads) on revitalising poetry with what he calls the language of the ‘rustic’ and the ‘low’. Cavell suggests that this emphasis is akin to a philosophical orientation on the ‘ordinary’ and the ‘everyday’. This paper teases out the implications of this claim. It offers a reading of the ‘Intimations Ode’ that seeks to compare Cavell’s insight with what Angela Esterhammer has called ‘the romantic performative’. It proceeds from this comparison to investigate <b>in</b> <b>further</b> <b>depth</b> the Cavellian conception of romanticism, and its relation to the questions of skepticism and ordinary language that are so fundamental to Cavell’s thought...|$|R

Although the larger of the sexes in species that exhibit sexual cannibalism are typically female, the extent of sexual size dimorphism is not constant across all species. To date, studies have been done on wolf spiders such as the Zyuzicosa species of the family Lycosidae, one case in which extreme sexual size dimorphism is observed with a female that is much larger than the male. This is also seen in the family Araneidae. Interestingly, this sexual size dimorphism is varied within species that participate in sexual cannibalism. For example, Praying mantids of the order Mantodea do not show the extreme sexual size dimorphism that wolf spiders do, although females are larger.|$|R

40|$|The Literacies for <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>Further</b> Education (LfLFE) {{research}} {{project has been}} funded for three years from January 2004 as part of Phase 3 of the Teaching and <b>Learning</b> Research Programme <b>in</b> the UK. The project involves collaboration between two universities and four further education (FE) colleges. The intention is to investigate students’ everyday literacy practices and explore ways of mobilizing these to enhance their learning on college courses. The LfLFE project does not view literacy {{as a set of}} individual skills and competences alone, but as emergent and situated in particular social contexts (Barton et al., 2000). As such, literacy practices are not static or bounded spatially or temporally. A central concern for the project is to understand how the literacy demands of college life and being a student relate to students’ other literacy practices. As part of the work of the project, the group is undertaking a ‘mapping’ of the literacy demands associated with student learning across a wide range of FE courses. This paper explores the methodological debates in planning and operationalizing this mapping.

Introduction In the standard theory of probability, degrees of belief for events or propositions take values in the real interval [0, 1]. From degrees of belief on the primitive propositions, the theory dictates degrees of belief for various compound and conditional propositions, and vice versa. Computational schemes for probabilistic reasoning apply this theory to the automated derivation of degrees of belief for designated propositions of interest given prespecified degrees of belief over some other propositions and some particular conditioning propositions observed or hypothesized. This approach has, among other advantages, those accruing to a well understood and powerful underlying theory. Despite these virtues, many have objected to the straig [...] ...|$|R

The features we use do not capture the batching which occurs as part of the ‘Pilot Judgment Procedure’, nor the ‘case law guides’ which streamlines the cases themselves. We expect that a promising avenue for future research on this topic could be to explore the connection between these streamlining procedures and citation patterns in the court, a question which has an interplay with the more general challenge of how algorithms shape decision making in public institutions (O’Neil 2016).|$|R

This article integrates key themes from sociology {{of religion in the}} context of emerging ideas about religion and entrepreneurship in order to highlight key research questions.

A macro-level empirical investigation of societal indicators of religious affiliation and regulation of religion alongside Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data highlights particular data correlations and mediating influences. A significant association between entrepreneurial activity and evangelical or Pentecostal Christian religious affiliation is found, along with evidence that the impact of religion on entrepreneurship is mediated through pluralism and regulation. In discussing these findings further, the article proposes a more integrated conceptual framework for understanding the link between religious drivers and entrepreneurship, alongside institutional mediation.
