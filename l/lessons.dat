Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: <b>Lessons</b> for Children of two to three (1778); <b>Lessons</b> for Children of three, part I (1778); <b>Lessons</b> for Children of three, part II (1778); and <b>Lessons</b> for Children of three to four (1779).
