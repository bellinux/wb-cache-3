Olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution (Patanol®) was introduced to the market in Japan in October 2006. In a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) test, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution significantly suppressed ocular itching and hyperemia compared with <b>levocabastine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> 0. 05 % ophthalmic solution, and the number of patients who complained of ocular discomfort was lower in the olopatadine group than in the levocabastine group. Conjunctival cell membrane disruption was observed in vitro in the ketotifen fumarate group, epinastine hydrochloride group, and azelastine hydrochloride group, but not in the olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution group, which may potentially explain the lower discomfort felt by patients on instillation. Many other studies in humans have revealed the superiority of olopatadine 0. 1 % hydrochloride eye drops to several other anti-allergic eye drops. Overseas, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % ophthalmic solution for a once-daily regimen has been marketed under the brand name of Pataday®. It is expected that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions may be used in patients with a more severe spectrum of allergic conjunctival diseases, such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic keratoconjunctivitis, in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Background: Approximately 16. 2 % of the Japanese {{population}} {{suffer from}} cedar pollinosis, with various manifestations such as ophthalmic, laryngo-pharyngeal and skin symptoms {{in addition to}} nasal symptoms. Thus, the annual pollen season is an agonizing period for patients. No study has reported symptoms and their clinical courses after conjunctival provocation with purified cedar pollen allergen Cry j 1 as well as suppression of these allergen-induced ocular symptoms by antihistamine eye drops. Methods: Nine patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis who had no nasal or ocular symptoms {{were included in the}} present study, after obtaining informed consent in writing. 1) Purified cedar pollen allergen Cry j 1 was instilled in the left eye and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the right eye as a control. 2) <b>Levocabastine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> ophthalmic suspension and ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution were respectively instilled in the left and right eyes, which were then challenged with the allergen. Ocular symptoms after provocation with the allergen were recorded through the clinical course. Results: Pollen allergen-induced ocular symptoms were itching and hyperemia of the palpebral conjunctiva, and itching lasted for more than 5 hours. Moreover, preadministration of antihistamine eye drops suppressed the increases in the ocular symptom scores, eliminating itching within 1 hour. Allergen provoked not only ocular symptoms but also nasal symptoms in 77. 8 % of patients. Conclusions: Preadministration of antihistamine eye drops suppressed the symptoms induced by the allergen, which suggests that this is an effective early therapy for Japanese cedar pollinosis, if it is started before the pollen season. However, self-protection by patients using a mask may not be effective enough to suppress nasal symptoms during the pollen season, requiring them to additionally wear glasses to avoid exposure to the allergen...|$|E
