25|$|Krupa {{praised the}} use of the Wii U gamepad as the Camera Obsura and enjoyed combat for most of the game, but found the latter third of the game tedious due to {{repetitive}} battles. Corriae enjoyed {{the use of}} the gamepad despite some control issues, Bates was highly positive about the thrill it brought into battles, while Turi found that the function did not bring long-term enjoyment and that backtracking through environments negatively impacted on the experience. Wilson likewise enjoyed the gamepad's role in the game, while faulting most other aspects including the high amount of health items and character controls. Orry said that the new controls made combat more claustrophobic than in previous games, while Brown enjoyed the immersion the gamepad brought. Famitsu was highly positive about {{the use of the}} gamepad, saying that it felt <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the midst of battles. These sentiments were echoed by Dengeki, but stated that some combat situations made aiming difficult. Multiple reviewers mentioned and generally faulted the stiff controls and character movement.|$|E
500|$|At {{the behest}} of XL owner Richard Russell, the xx {{recorded}} their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio—XL Studio—making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it {{at the beginning of}} 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal, and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was soundproof and [...] "isolated {{from the rest of the}} office, so it wasn't <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> working in the record company's presence." [...] Croft, on the other hand, called it a [...] "pretty confined space" [...] the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized soundboard ideal for recording a small group.|$|E

500|$|Relic did not {{specifically}} {{set out to}} create a real-time strategy game; Garden and Relic were primarily focused on making a game with exciting large-scale space battles, and chose the genre {{in order to support}} that. As a result, they did not try to make innovative gameplay changes in the real-time strategy genre, but instead worked on making implementing the genre in a fully-3D space to make the space battles they envisioned. Garden told Computer Games Magazine in 1998 that [...] "there's no sort of design philosophy behind it. The fact that it's real-time strategy was almost a fluke." [...] The original Star Wars film trilogy was one of the games primary inspirations, along with the 1970s television series Battlestar Galactica: in a 1998 interview with PC Zone, Garden stated that his original concept for the game was [...] "a 3D game that looked <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching Star Wars but had a storyline like Battlestar Galactica". He drew further inspiration from correcting what he felt were the limitations of the first-person space flight game [...] He felt that having the player control a ship from a cockpit view detracted from the feeling of the overall battles, and so chose to have the player control a whole fleet from an external view.|$|E
500|$|Swift and Liz Rose wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during Swift's {{freshman}} year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea {{in the midst of}} her mathematics class: [...] "I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody." [...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E

"The More You Talk the Less I Hear" [...] {{started out}} under the name [...] "Storm" [...] because the group wanted to {{incorporate}} [...] "something with a real-life feel of a storm in it", according to Decicco.

[...] The [...] "heart" [...] of [...] "Basement Ghost Singing" [...] was built around Jorgensen playing with a Line 6 pedal, according to Decicco. The track included a mixture of real drums as well as drum loops. The intro to [...] "Walking at Night, Alone" [...] uses a blend of acoustic and electric guitar. The idea for this came from Machine; it was originally only acoustic guitar until he [...] "wanted me to play it on electric guitar, too.

2500|$|On March 12, 2003, McGraw {{was working}} as an {{instructor}} for the Phillies during spring training when he was hospitalized with a brain tumor. When the surgery was performed to remove it, initial reports suggested that the surgery had been successful, that McGraw's chances for recovery were [...] "excellent," [...] {{and that he was}} supposed to live [...] "a long time.". [...] However, the tumor was not totally excised by the surgery, and the malignancy returned in inoperable form. [...] McGraw lived for over nine months after the initial surgery. In what would be his last public appearance, McGraw attended the closing ceremonies of Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on September 28, 2003 where he recreated the final out of the Phillies' World Series triumph. McGraw died on January 5, 2004. The Mets played the 2004 season with the words [...] "Ya Gotta Believe" [...] embroidered on their left shoulders in McGraw's honor, and the Phillies wore a patch on their right shoulder featuring a shamrock in honor of McGraw and a banner reading [...] "Pope" [...] in honor of longtime Phillies executive Paul Owens, who had also died that winter. [...] His son Tim's 2004 hit [...] "Live <b>Like</b> <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> Dying" [...] (written by Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman) was recorded in his father's honor, and featured the memorable clip of McGraw recording the final out of the 1980 World Series in the music video. The song reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard country music charts, and held that position for a total of seven weeks. It was named as the Number One country song of 2004 by Billboard.|$|E
