60|$|What a {{wonderful}} harvesting scene greeted Kurt Dorn! Never had its like {{been seen in}} the Northwest, nor perhaps in any other place. A huge pall of dust, chaff, and smoke hung over the vast wheat-field, and the air seemed charged with a roar. The glaring gold of the wheat-field appeared to be crisscrossed everywhere with bobbing black streaks of horses--bays, blacks, whites, and reds; by big, moving painted machines, <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> and puffing straw; by immense wagons piled high with sheaves of wheat, lumbering down to the smoking engines and the threshers that sent long streams of dust and chaff over the lifting straw-stacks; by wagons following the combines to pick up the plump brown sacks of wheat; and by a string of empty wagons coming in from the road.|$|E

5000|$|Two further tilt bridges {{are known}} to exist in Belgium, both {{constructed}} in 2011. The Scheepsdalebrug (Scheepsdalebridge) in Brugge and the Sint-Annabrug over the river Dender in Aalst. The former combines the working mechanisms of a rolling lift bascule bridge and a tilt bridge: the bridge is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which roll along racks, positioned parallel to the navigable way, tilting up the bridge leaf providing a clearance for passing ships. The latter is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which are connected to fixed pivot points a few feet downstream from the bridge leaf.|$|E
5000|$|To {{raise the}} bridge an initial lift {{to the inner}} end of the bridge is required. This raises the inner wheels back up the {{inclines}} of the granite slabs. At {{the same time the}} outer ends are pulled from the lip of the granite slab, the wheels rolling down the sprung metal guides. When the inner wheels are pulled up onto the metal trays the weight of the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> assists the raising of the bridge to a point where the centre of gravity of the arms is over the pivot of the upper support stays. From here on the pull necessary to raise the centre wheels is negligible. Once the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> are in the fully retracted position the centre wheels are on top of the metal trays and the axles disengage from the cups. The bridge now sits on its inner two axles. From here it is necessary to pull the bridge in until the outer two wheels arrive at the trays. The bridge is then pulled within the gates on all six wheels.|$|E
50|$|A Schnabel {{car is a}} {{specialized}} type of railroad freight car. It is designed to carry heavy and oversized loads {{in such a way}} that the load makes up part of the car. The load is suspended between the two ends of the cars by lifting arms; the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> are connected to an assembly of span bolsters that distribute the weight of the load and the lifting arm over a large number of wheels.|$|E
50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm),</b> needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} hitch sizes, called categories. The higher category hitches have sturdier <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> and larger connector pins.|$|R
50|$|When a Schnabel car is empty, the two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> are {{connected}} {{and the car}} can usually operate at normal freight train speeds. Some Schnabel cars include hydraulic equipment that will either lift or horizontally shift the load while in transit (at very low speeds) to clear obstructions along the car's route. As of 2012, there were 31 Schnabel cars operating in Europe, 30 in North America, 25 in Asia, and one in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The hitch <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> are {{powered by}} the tractor's own {{hydraulic}} system. The hydraulic system {{is controlled by the}} operator, and usually a variety of settings are available. A draft control mechanism is often present in modern three-point hitch systems. The draft of the implement, the amount of force it is taking to pull the implement, is sensed on the lower arms and the hydraulic system automatically raises the arms slightly when the draft increases and lowers the arms when the draft decreases.|$|E
50|$|Bridges of {{this type}} were fitted to the forts of the Portsdown Hill line at Portsmouth. The <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> of both bridges survive at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth, United Kingdom. Other {{locations}} at which the bridge was installed include Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery in Malta. The remains of another Guthrie bridge was discovered at the main caponier of The Verne Citadel at Portland, Dorset, during research conducted by The Palmerston Forts Society and Hampshire County Council Architects for restoration work on the bridges at Fort Nelson.|$|E
50|$|Mounted on a {{lightweight}} chassis with rail wheels, the operators cab and <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> pivot on a base, enabling 360 degree rotation. The {{end of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> has a gripper for picking up sleepers, and a movable wrist to allow the tie to be positioned. Often a small trolley {{is connected to the}} tie crane by a drawbar, for either storage of new sleepers to be placed into the track, or for taking away old sleepers that have been removed.|$|R

50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the centre axle being offset from the centre of the girders causing the bridge to run on its inner two wheels. The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the centre axle then engage in the cups of the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its inner wheels still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the inner wheels are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit curved sprung metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the inner wheels descending the slope of the inner granite slab. The inner end of each girder is angled to form a close fit with the granite slab.|$|E
5000|$|Once on the ground, the {{aircraft}} {{had to be}} retrieved by a Scheuch-Schlepper, a converted small agricultural vehicle, originally based {{on the concept of}} the two-wheel tractor, carrying a detachable third swiveling wheel at the extreme rear of its design for stability in normal use—this swiveling third wheel was replaced with a pivoting, special retrieval trailer that rolled on a pair of short, triple-wheeled continuous track setups (one per side) for military service wherever the Komet was based. This retrieval trailer usually possessed twin trailing <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> that lifted the stationary aircraft off the ground from under each wing whenever it was not already on its twin-wheel [...] "dolly" [...] main gear, as when {{the aircraft}} had landed on its ventral skid and tailwheel after a mission. Another form of trailer, known also to have been trialled with the later B-series examples, was tried during the Komets test phase, which used a pair of sausage-shaped air bags in place of the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> and could also be towed by the Scheuch-Schlepper tractor, inflating the air bags to lift the aircraft. The three-wheeled Scheuch-Schlepper tractor used for the task was originally meant for farm use, but such a vehicle with a specialized trailer was required as the Komet was unpowered after exhausting its rocket propellants, and lacked main wheels after landing, from the jettisoning of its [...] "dolly" [...] main gear at takeoff. The slightly larger Sd Kfz 2 Kettenkrad half-track motorcycle, known to be used with the Me 262 jet fighter for ground handling needs, and documented as also being used with the Arado Ar 234B jet recon-bomber, was not known to have ever been used for ground handling operations with the Komet at any time.|$|E
5000|$|An ageing suit (also spelt as aging suit) is a suit {{pioneered by}} the {{automotive}} industry in simulating the constraints of older aged drivers. Ageing suits were first used by Japanese car-maker Nissan in the early 21st Century, since Japan has a large aged population. MIT's ageing suit, nicknamed [...] "AGNES", {{has been used in}} research by companies such as Siemens, Daimler and General Mills. [...] The suits target and enable the study and solving of such senior citizenry infirmities as bad balance, stiff joints, weaker eyesight and extra weight. According to Nissan's associate chief designer Etsuhiro Watanabe; [...] "Difficulty in walking, back pains, trouble in <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> -- we wanted to consider assorted infirmities. It's easy to do this for the young, but we wanted to design for adverse conditions and see what modifications are needed." ...|$|E

5000|$|The raising chains could {{themselves}} {{be attached to}} counterweights. In some cases, a portcullis provides the weight, as at Alnwick. By the 14th century a bascule arrangement was provided by <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> (called [...] "gaffs") above and parallel to the bridge deck whose ends were linked by chains to the lifting end of the bridge; in the raised position the gaffs would fit into slots in the gatehouse wall ("rainures") which can often still be seen, as at Herstmonceux Castle. Inside the castle the gaffs were extended to bear counterweights, or might form the side-timbers of a stout gate which would be against {{the roof of the}} gate-passage when the drawbridge was down, but would close against the gate-arch as the bridge was raised. In France, working drawbridges survive at a number of châteaux, including the Château du Plessis-Bourré. [...] In England, two working drawbridges remain in regular use at Helmingham Hall, which dates from the early sixteenth century.|$|E

Improved arms have been designed through dynamic and static analyses to increase safety if a sheet not present on the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> To design the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> experimentation is very helpful, however, it is difficult and dangerous to experiment on patients; therefore, a simple human model was made and used for the dynamic analysis. Through the dynamic analysis results, a safe width and comfortable location for the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> were determined.

In addition, tests have been conducted to confirm comfort and safety by deploying the designed <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> onto a transportation robot...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is {{the design of the}} working table, which will ensure the stem lifting and its transport to the splitting semi-automat. Lifting of stem with weight up to 500 kg is ensured by <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> Then, the stem is moved to the splitting semi-automatic by means of a belt conveyor. The design of the frame is designed to withstand a load of 5000 N. The lowest security has k = 1. 2 according to the strength analysis. The table frame can be easily folded using a hydraulic cylinder. Thanks to this we can easily mount the frame behind a splitter semi-automatic and transport both devices at the same time...|$|E
