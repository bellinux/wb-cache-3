The unique technology of the patented Lokring fittings utilize Elastic Strain Preload(ESP), and possesses a metal to metal <b>leak-free</b> seal that compresses or swages the pipe/tube wall.|$|E
50|$|The Luer taper is a {{standardized}} system of small-scale fluid fittings used for making <b>leak-free</b> connections between a male-taper fitting and its mating female part on medical and laboratory instruments, including hypodermic syringe tips and needles or stopcocks and needles. Currently ISO 80369 governs the Luer standards and testing methods.|$|E
50|$|Valves in good {{condition}} should be <b>leak-free.</b> However, valves may eventually wear out from use and develop a leak, either between the {{inside and outside of}} the valve or, when the valve is shut to stop flow, between the disc and the seat. A particle trapped between the seat and disc could also cause such leakage.|$|E
5000|$|National Pipe Taper Fuel (NPTF), {{also called}} Dryseal American National Standard Taper Pipe Thread, defined by ASME B1.20.3, is {{designed}} to provide a more <b>leak-free</b> seal without the use of PTFE tape (often referred to by the popular brand name [...] "Teflon") or other sealant compound. NPTF threads have the same basic shape but with crest and root heights adjusted for an interference fit, eliminating the spiral leakage path.|$|E
50|$|Waterworks is a {{card game}} created by Parker Brothers in 1972. The game pieces {{consist of a}} deck of 110 pipe cards, 1 bathtub-shaped card tray, and 10 small metal wrenches. The object is for each player to create a {{pipeline}} of a designated length, beginning with a valve and ending with a spout. Players race {{to be the first}} to complete a continuous, <b>leak-free</b> pipeline that connects their valve card to their spout card.|$|E
5000|$|This thread form's good debris {{tolerance}} is {{the source}} of its use in oilfields, where it provides a <b>leak-free</b> connection in field use. Many European automobiles use a knuckle thread for their [...] "tow eye," [...] an external threaded recess where a steel towing lug can be fitted. For example, some Porsche cars use DIN 405 Rd 20 x 1/8", and some BMW use a thread similar to DIN 405 Rd 16 x 1/8".|$|E
50|$|Sundyne {{also has}} the widest range of {{sealless}} magnet drive pumps in the world. HMD Pumps (A Sundyne subsidiary) invented the magnetic drive pump in 1947. The Sundyne sealless magnetic drive pumps are <b>leak-free</b> and ideal for difficult, high value and hazardous fluid processing where containment, reliability and safety are imperative. Sundyne Ansimag sealless magnetic drive pumps are non-metallic and fit ANSI standards. Sundyne HMD/Kontro sealless magnetic drive pumps are metallic with models in ISO, API-610 and API-685 standards.|$|E
50|$|In November 1997, the {{reservoir}} was refilled after a particularly dry summer. The water flow was {{so large that}} {{the reservoir}} required an emergency draw-down. With the water level at a temporary low, there {{was an opportunity to}} inspect the Heapey embankment on Moor Road, which had been leaking since the 1960s. The condition of the embankment and surrounding strata were such that a phased grouting operation was required to remedy the leakage. The reservoir was refilled, but was still leaking. After a second grouting and refill operation, the embankment was deemed <b>leak-free.</b>|$|E
50|$|CuproBraze {{has more}} {{strength}} at elevated temperatures than soldered copper-brass or aluminium. Due {{to the lower}} thermal expansion of copper versus aluminium, there is less thermal stress during the manufacturing of CuproBraze and in its use as a heat exchanger. CuproBraze heat exchangers have stronger tube-to-header joints than other materials. These braze joints are the most critical in heat exchangers and must be <b>leak-free.</b> CuproBraze also has higher tolerances to internal pressures because its thin-gauge high strength materials provide stronger support for the tubes. The material is also less sensitive to bad coolants than aluminium heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|There {{should be}} a {{properly}} sized vacuum receiver tank which can maintain system vacuum if the pump fails during a production run. This will be feasible only if the vacuum plumbing is virtually <b>leak-free.</b> This is why vacuum leakage {{is one of the}} major concerns in the pre-acceptance testing of the machine. For a typical composites autoclave, a 5 to 10 cuft L receiver might be appropriate. Note that this receiver must be ASME stamped for the full operating pressure of the autoclave, since it is conceivable that a vacuum system failure could result in this much pressure being vented into the receiver.|$|E
50|$|Triumph and BSA {{were well}} aware of Honda's ability but while the Japanese were only making smaller engined models, the large engine market was {{considered}} safe. When the first Honda 750 cc four cylinder was released for sale to the public, Triumph and BSA had trouble. Despite developing and releasing a 3-cylinder 750 cc engined motorcycle prior to the Japanese fours: the BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident, the Japanese bikes were praised in the press for their modernity (disc brakes, 4-cylinder engines, <b>leak-free</b> engine casings, etc). The British triples outperformed the Japanese fours (top speed, acceleration and handling) but the Japanese fours required less maintenance and they did not leak.|$|E
5000|$|These methods {{base on the}} {{principle}} of conservation of mass. In the steady state, the mass flow [...] entering a <b>leak-free</b> pipeline will balance the mass flow [...] leaving it; any drop in mass leaving the pipeline (mass imbalance [...] ) indicates a leak. Balancing methods measure [...] and [...] using flowmeters and finally compute the imbalance which is an estimate of the unknown, true leak flow. Comparing this imbalance (typically monitored over a number of periods) against a leak alarm threshold [...] generates an alarm if this monitored imbalance. Enhanced balancing methods additionally take into account the change rate of the mass inventory of the pipeline. Names that are used for enhanced line balancing techniques are volume balance, modified volume balance, and compensated mass balance.|$|E
50|$|A {{plain tube}} {{can be used}} as a siphon. An {{external}} pump has to be applied to start the liquid flowing and prime the siphon. This can be a human mouth. This is sometimes done with any <b>leak-free</b> hose to siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle's gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or aspirating it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a siphon pump to start the siphon process.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} basic methods walls control water intrusion: {{moisture}} storage, drained cladding, or face-sealed cladding. Moisture storage {{is typical of}} stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by {{the walls of the}} structure itself. Drained cladding also known as screened walls acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. Face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier cladding relies on maintaining a <b>leak-free</b> surface of the cladding. Examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior insulation finishing systems, structural glazing, metal clad panels, and corrugated metal.|$|E
40|$|In [AGP 14] Ananth et al. {{showed that}} continual leakage-resilient non-transferable {{interactive}} proofs exist when a <b>leak-free</b> input-encoding phase is allowed {{and a common}} reference string is available. They left open the problem of removing the need of a common reference string. In [BGJK 12] Boyle et al. showed that for some interesting functionalities continual leakage-resilient secure computation is possible when <b>leak-free</b> interactive preprocessing and input-encoding phases are allowed. They left open the problem of removing the interactive pre-processing. In this work we study the above questions. Our main contribution shows that leakage-resilient black-box zero-knowledge is impossible when relying on a <b>leak-free</b> input-encoding phase only (i. e., without CRS/preprocessing). Additionally, we also show that leakage-resilient multi-party computation for all functionalities is impossible (regardless {{of the number of}} players assuming just one corrupted player) when relying only on a <b>leak-free</b> input-encoding phase (i. e., without CRS/preprocessing). Our results are achieved by extending a technique of [NVZ 13] to prove lower bounds for leakage-resilient security. Indeed as in [NVZ 13] we use leakage queries to run an execution of a communication-efficient protocol in the head of the adversary. Moreover, to defeat the black-box simulator we connect the above technique for leakage resilience to security against reset attacks...|$|E

40|$|Side channel attacks – {{attacks that}} exploit implementation-dependent {{information}} of a cryptosystem – {{have been shown}} to be highly detrimental, and the cryptographic community has recently focused on developing techniques for securing implementations against such attacks. An important model called Only Computation Leaks (OCL) [Micali and Reyzin, TCC ’ 04] and its stronger variants were proposed to model a broad class of leakage attacks (a type of side-channel attack). These models allow for unbounded, arbitrary leakage as long as (1) information in each leakage observation is bounded, and (2) different parts of the computation leak independently. Various results and techniques have been developed for these models and we continue this line of research in the current work. We address the problem of compiling any circuit into a circuit secure against OCL attacks. In order to leverage the OCL assumption, the resulting circuit will be split into components, where at any point in time only a single component is active. Optimally, we would like to output a circuit that has only one component, and no part of the computation needs to be <b>leak-free.</b> However, this task is impossible due to the result of Barak et al. [JACM ’ 12]. The current state-of-the-art constructions achieve either two components with additional <b>leak-free</b> hardware, or many components without <b>leak-free</b> hardware...|$|E
40|$|In his {{keynote speech}} at CHES 2004, Kocher {{advocated}} that sidechannel attacks were an illustration that formal cryptography {{was not as}} secure as it was believed because some assumptions (e. g., no auxiliary information is available during the computation) were not modeled. This failure {{is due to the}} fact that formal methods work with models rather than implementations. Of course, we can use formal methods to prove non-functional security properties such as the absence of side-channel leakages. But a common obstacle is that those properties are very low-level and appear incompatible with formalization. To avoid the discrepancy between the model and the implementation, we apply formal methods directly on the implementation. Doing so, we can formally prove that an assembly code is <b>leak-free,</b> provided that the hardware it runs on satisfies a finite (and limited) set of properties that we show are realistic. We apply this technique to prove that a present implementation in 8 bit AVR assembly code is <b>leak-free...</b>|$|E
40|$|Current transient-based leak {{detection}} methods for pipeline systems often {{rely on a}} good understanding of the system—including unsteady friction, pipe roughness, precise geometry and micro considerations such as minor offtakes—in the absence of leaks. Such knowledge constitutes a very high hurdle and, even if known, may be impossible to include in the mathematical equations governing system behavior. An alternative is to test the <b>leak-free</b> system to find precise behavior, obviously a problem if the system is not known to be free of leaks. The <b>leak-free</b> response {{can be used as a}} benchmark to compare with behavior of the leaking system. As an alternative, this paper uses the impulse response function (IRF) as a means of {{leak detection}}. The IRF provides a unique a relationship between an injected transient event and a measured pressure response from a pipeline. This relationship is based on the physical characteristics of the system and is useful in determining its integrity. Transient responses of completely different shapes can be directly compared using the IRF. The IRF refines all system reflections to sharp pulses, thus promoting greater accuracy in leak location, and allowing leak reflections to be detected without a <b>leak-free</b> benchmark, even when complex signals such as pseudo-random binary signals are injected into the system. Additionally, the IRF approach can be used to improve existing leak detection methods. In experimental tests at the University of Adelaide the IRF approach was able to detect and locate leaks accurately. Pedro J. Lee, John P. Vitkovsky, Martin F. Lambert, Angus R. Simpson and James Ligget...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA novel {{economic}} <b>leak-free</b> underground injection {{technology of}} greenhouse gas—the carbon (CO 2) microbubbles sequesrtrationcan bring the deep reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emission into reality around the world. The atomized foams of CO 2 gas, CO 2 supercritical fluid or CO 2 liquid are dispersed deep into tiny pores of wide variety of underground rocks for virtually permanent storage. The gas microbubbles injection may be effective also for the EOR and EGR in tight rocks such as oil shale and gas shale. Combined effect of hardly buoyant carbon microbubbles, heavy carbon dioxide solution and various trapping mechanisms makes the carbon microbubbles sequestration stable and <b>leak-free</b> in wide variety of geology. The carbon microbubbles injection is suitable also to small scale sequestration of greenhouse gases in the coming hydrogen society as well as large scale CO 2 storage from big coal-fired power plants. The dispersion and dilution of CO 2 in large volume of deep groundwater and rocks by scattered relatively small-scale carbon microbubbles injections are an earth-friendly strategy of greenhouse gas sequestration. The flexibility of site selection makes the source-sink matching much easier for the carbon microbubbles sequestration than conventional direct large-scale injection practices. As we can find the suitable site for the storage near of many large sources of carbon dioxide, the carbon microbubbles sequestration is practically energy-saving and cost-effective greenhouse gas reduction method in many regions. The carbon microbubbles injection can produce the reductive geochemical and biological environments in tiny pores of igneous (especially oceanic) rocks and sequestrate CO 2 into carbonates, organics and methane in the similar mechanism to the Early Archaean earth. The autogenous sealing by carbonate trapping and by hydrate trapping provides the leak proof storage of anthropogenic CO 2 in the deep oceanic crust. The carbon microbubbles sequestration (CMS) provides the economig <b>leak-free</b> option of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) and a break-through for the prevention of global warming...|$|E

40|$|A new {{adhesive}} bonding method is introduced for microlamination architectures, for producing low-temperature microchannel arrays {{in a wide}} variety of metals. Sheet metal embossing and chemical etching processes have been used to produce sealing bosses and flow features, resulting in approximately 50 % fewer laminae over traditional methods. These lamina designs are enabled by reduced bonding pressures required for the new method. An assembly process using adhesive dispense and cure is outlined to produce <b>leak-free</b> devices. Feasible fill ratios were determined to be 1. 1 in general and 1. 25 around fluid headers, largely due to gaps between faying surfaces caused by surface roughness. Bond strength investigation reveals robustness to surface conditions and a bond strength of 5. 5 – 8. 5 MPa using a 3 X safety factor. Dimensional characterization reveals a two sigma (95 %) post-bonded channel height tolerance under 10 % (9. 6 %) after bonding. Patterning tolerance and surface roughness of the faying laminae were found to have a significant influence on the final post-bonded channel height. Leakage and burst pressure testing on several samples has established confidence that {{adhesive bonding}} can produce <b>leak-free</b> joints. Operating pressures up to 413 kPa have been satisfied, equating to tensile pressure on bond joints o...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{methods can}} be used to assess energy {{expenditure}} (EE). The Fick method allows an easy calculation of EE in critically ill patients with Swan-Ganz catheters. Indirect calorimetry can be performed using either closed circuit or open circuit techniques. The latter is accurate when the patient is breathing air or low-FiO 2 gaz mixture, but inaccurate at high FiO 2. The accuracy of instruments, the presence of a <b>leak-free</b> system and the mathematical manipulations are critical points. Calorimetric studies performed in patients receiving high FiO 2 must be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|It is {{desirable}} that in analytical microfluidic {{systems such as}} chip-based liquid chromatography that fluidic channel structure is robust enough so to avoid channel fracture at high pressure operation. In addition, the system fluidic dead volume should be minimized so to enhance analysis quality or shorten the analysis time.

40|$|Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a {{promising}} technique for growing ultrathin, pristine dielectrics on metal substrates, which {{is essential to}} many electronic devices. Tunnel junctions are an excellent example which require a <b>leak-free,</b> ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier of typical thickness around 1 nm between two metal electrodes. A challenge {{in the development of}} ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier using ALD is controlling the nucleation of dielectrics on metals with minimal formation of native oxides at the metal surface for high-quality interfaces between the tunnel barrier and metal electrodes. This poses a critical need for integrating ALD with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) physical vapor deposition. In order to address these challenges, a viscous-flow ALD chamber was designed and interfaced to an UHV magnetron sputtering chamber via a load lock. A sample transportation system was implemented for in situ sample transfer between the ALD, load lock, and sputtering chambers. Using this integrated ALD-UHV sputtering system, superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Nb/Al/Al 2 O 3 /Nb Josephson tunnel junctions were fabricated with tunnel barriers of thickness varied from sub-nm to ~ 1 nm. The suitability of using an Al wetting layer for initiation of the ALD Al 2 O 3 tunnel barrier was investigated with ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. With optimized processing conditions, <b>leak-free</b> SIS tunnel junctions were obtained, demonstrating the viability of this integrated ALD-UHV sputtering system for the fabrication of tunnel junctions and devices comprised of metal-dielectric-metal multilayers.

First, the photolithographic property of OSTE+ is shown by using a photomask to create micropillars with an aspect-ratio of 1 : 10 in a 2 mm thick layer. Secondly, a three-layer OSTE+ microdevice containing in-/outlet holes, channels, and pillars is fabricated by {{using a combination of}} direct lithography and adhesive-free dry bonding. The resulting microdevice shows desirable properties, such as <b>leak-free</b> filling and hydrophilic surfaces.

40|$|We analyse the {{trade-off}} between {{the speed with}} which a gene can propagate information, the noise of its output and its metabolic cost. Our main finding is that for any given level of metabolic cost there is an optimal trade-off between noise and processing speed. Any system with a non-vanishing leak expression rate is suboptimal, i. e. it will exhibit higher noise and/or slower speed than <b>leak-free</b> systems with the same metabolic cost. We also show that there is an optimal Hill coefficient h which minimizes noise and metabolic cost at fixed speeds, and an optimal threshold K which minimizes noise. © 2009 The Royal Society...|$|E
