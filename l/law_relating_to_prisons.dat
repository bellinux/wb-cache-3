50|$|In 1888 Normanton {{became the}} central town {{of the police}} {{district}} and therefore the court district. On 25 November 1890 The Prisons Act assented with the aim to consolidate and amend the <b>law</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> gaols, <b>prisons,</b> houses of correction and penal establishments. This Act created a prisons department {{under the control of}} the Comptroller General and clarified the distinction between a Police Gaol, being a specially proclaimed lock up or watch house, and a prison. As a result of this Act Normanton was initially proclaimed a Police Goal in 1891, possibly as an interim measure until the construction on the larger site could be undertaken. In 1890 a gaol reserve of nine acres was proclaimed on the outskirts of town adjacent to the hospital reserve. Plans were drawn up for the Gaol reserve by William Taylor Jack who was working in Normanton as the Foreman of Works for the Department of Public Works at the time. These plans incorporated warder's residence and a total of twenty four cells.|$|R
