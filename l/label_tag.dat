40|$|Peptide {{labeling}} with isobaric tags {{has become}} a popular technique in quantitative shotgun proteomics. Using two different samples viz. a protein mixture and HeLa extracts, we show that three commercially available isobaric tags differ with regard to peptide identification rates: The number of identified proteins and peptides was largest with iTRAQ 4 -plex, followed by TMT 6 -plex, and smallest with iTRAQ 8 -plex. In all experiments, we employed a previously described method where two scans were acquired for each precursor on an LTQ Orbitrap: A CID scan under standard settings for identification, and a HCD scan for quantification. The observed differences in identification rates were similar when data was searched with either Mascot or Sequest. We consider these findings {{to be the result}} of a combination of several factors, most notably prominent ions in CID spectra as a consequence of loss of fragments of the <b>label</b> <b>tag</b> from precursor ions. These fragment ions cannot be explained by current search engines and were observed to have a negative impact on peptide scores...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} 1) develop {{a method that}} {{completely}} separated hepatic (VLDL 1, VLDL 2) and intestinal [chylomicron (CM) ] lipoproteins and 2) use the method to measure triacylglycerol (TAG) kinetics in these lipoproteins in the fed and fasting state in healthy subjects, using intravenous [²H₅]glycerol as the tracer. An immunoaffinity method that completely separated hepatic and intestinal particles using sequential binding to three antibodies to apolipoprotein B- 100 (apoB- 100) was established and validated. Six healthy volunteers were studied in a fasted and continuous feeding study (study 1). Five additional healthy volunteers were studied in a continuous feeding study that included an oral [¹³C₃]glycerol tripalmitin tracer (study 2). In both studies, an intravenous bolus of [²H₅]glycerol was administered to <b>label</b> <b>TAG</b> in hepatic and intestinal lipoproteins. In both feeding studies there was sufficient incorporation of the [²H₅]glycerol tracer into the exogenous lipoproteins to enable isotopic enrichment to be measured. In study 2, the oral tracer enrichment in VLDL 1 was < 5 % of CM enrichment 150 min after tracer administration, demonstrating negligible contamination of VLDL 1 with apoB- 48. Western blotting showed no detectable apoB- 100 in CMs. VLDL 1 and VLDL 2 TAG fractional catabolic rate (FCR) did not differ between feeding and fasting (study 1).

40|$|A {{protocol}} for the quantitative detection of Escherichia coli O 157 in raw and concentrated surface waters using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence (IM-ECL) {{was developed and}} optimized. Three antibody sandwich formats were tested: commercial anti-O 157 :H 7 IM beads, IM beads made in-house with a polyclonal anti-O 157 :H 7 immunoglobulin G (IgG), or IM beads made in-house with a monoclonal anti-O 157 :H 7 IgG coupled with a polyclonal anti-O 157 :H 7 IgG to which an electrochemiluminescent <b>label</b> (<b>TAG)</b> was attached. The monoclonal IM bead-polyclonal TAG format was chosen for optimization because it gave lower background levels and linear regression slopes of ca. 1. 0, indicative of a constant ECL signal per cell. The dynamic range was ca. 101 to 105 cells ml− 1 in phosphate-buffered saline and in raw water samples. The monoclonal IM beads selectively captured E. coli O 157 cells {{in the presence of}} ca. 108 cells of a non-O 157 strain of E. coli ml− 1. Background ECL signals from concentrated (100 -fold) water samples were substantially higher and more variable than raw water samples. The background signal was partially eliminated by the addition of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. Successive cell capture incubations, termed sequential bead capture (SBC), were optimized for establishing baseline ECL values for individual water samples. The linear dynamic range with SBC was ca. 102 to 105 E. coli O 157 cells ml of concentrated water− 1. To validate the protocol, 10 -liter surface water samples were spiked with ca. 5, 000 E. coli O 157 (Odwalla) cells and concentrated by vortex filtration, and 1 - or 3 -ml aliquots were analyzed by IM-ECL. Differential ECL signals (SBC) from 1 - and 3 -ml samples were statistically significant and were generally consistent with standard curves for these cell concentrations. Enrichments were conducted with aliquots of spiked raw water and concentrated water using EC broth and minimal lactose broth (MLB). All tubes with concentrated water became turbid and gave a positive ECL response for E. coli O 157 (> 10, 000 ECL units); MLB gave a somewhat higher detection rate with spiked raw water. The potential sensitivity of the IM-ECL assay is ca. 25 E. coli O 157 cells ml of raw water− 1, 25 cells 100 ml of 100 -fold concentrated water− 1, or 1 to 2 viable cells liter− 1 with concentration and enrichment. The IM-ECL assay appears suitable for routine analysis and screening of water samples...|$|E

40|$|This {{demonstration}} paper {{presents a}} novel content-based music search system that accepts a query containing multiple tags with multiple levels of preference (denoted as an MTML query) to search music from an untagged music database. We select {{a limited number}} of most frequently used music tags to form the tag space and design an interface for users to input queries by operating the scroll bars. To effect MTML content-based music retrieval, we introduce a tagbased music aspect model that jointly models the auditory features and <b>tag</b> <b>labels</b> of a song. Two indexing methods and their corresponding matching methods, namely pseudo song-based matching and tag affinity-based matching, are incorporated into the pre-learned tag-based music aspect model. The content-based music search system is implemented on the MajorMiner dataset, which consists of 2, 472 10 -second music clips and their associated human <b>labeled</b> <b>tags</b> crawled from the MajorMiner website.
