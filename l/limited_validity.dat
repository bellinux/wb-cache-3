The same day, the Russian president's spokesman reiterated that his government would not hand over Snowden, noting that Putin was not personally involved in the matter and that it was being handled through talks between the FBI and Russia's FSB.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, the <b>validity</b> <b>limit</b> of the FAT for cracked media {{seems to}} depend on the wave modes.

The details of the dependence of the <b>validity</b> <b>limit</b> on the incident angle, however, remain unrevealed since we considered here only two kinds of incident angles (0 ° and 90 °); the case of oblique wave incidence should be investigated in future. It also remains to be clarified why the <b>validity</b> <b>limit</b> of the FAT seems to be lower for P wave incidence than for SV wave incidence.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fundamental {{study of the}} validity of the Energy Finite Element Method (EFEM) for plates with hysteresis damping.

This paper discusses a more fundamental explanation of the <b>validity</b> <b>limits</b> in terms of the assumptions and approximations of EFEM. For plates with hysteresis damping, a limit is found in terms of characteristic dimensions of the plate with respect to the wavelength. Plates with different shapes and boundary conditions are studied. Numerical examples with validation in analytic modal superposition solutions and classical dynamic FEM support the conclusions. 1...|$|R
