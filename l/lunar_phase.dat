5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the <b>lunar</b> <b>phase</b> and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E

As days pass, Satoru notices that he can see the same <b>lunar</b> <b>phase</b> at SPHIA and at the cabin and that both areas are surrounded by a body of water. It is revealed that the Yuni in the cabin is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E

40|$|Astronomy {{education}} researchers {{now know}} that college students do not enter the introductory astronomy classroom as blank slates, but rather these students enter the classroom with a pre-existing understanding of many introductory astronomy concepts, including <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> Sometimes this understanding is scientifically correct, but often students 2 ̆ 7 understanding is incomplete, inadequate or simply incorrect and cannot explain observed phenomenon. Unfortunately, students 2 ̆ 7 pre-existing understandings are often deeply rooted, and many students leave the classroom without a scientifically correct understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> The question now arises, how do instructors develop successful instruction so that students leave the classroom with a scientifically correct understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases?</b> The purpose of this research study was therefore to design instruction that enhances college students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> ^ This multi-phase study utilized both qualitative and quantitative research methods to fulfill this purpose by identifying students 2 ̆ 7 prior understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases,</b> developing the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Phases</b> Concept Inventory (LPCI) to measure conceptual change, designing and evaluating an in-class group activity designed to teach the concept of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> ^ Using a qualitative phenomenology, fourteen college students 2 ̆ 7 conceptual understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases</b> was uncovered. This conceptual understanding was organized into a conceptual framework with eight separate dimensions of student understanding, each with alternative facets of student understanding. Based upon this conceptual framework, the LPCI was developed. This instrument consists of fourteen multiple-choice items designed to assess student understanding of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> ^ Based on a modified Karplus Learning Cycle, an in-class group activity was developed to teach the concept of <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> During the fall semester of 1999, this activity was implemented at a midwestern university {{as part of a}} restructured astronomy course. This activity took only two fifty-minute class periods. Administered prior to and after instruction, the LPCI shows that the instruction was indeed effective. A statistical analysis of the results shows that the instruction produced an effect size of 2. 99 and a normalized gain of 0. 63. ...|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{mechanical}} engineer Michael Wright {{has demonstrated that}} there was a mechanism to supply the <b>lunar</b> <b>phase</b> in addition to the position. The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the sun and moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a differential gear, a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs. Among its other first-known aspects, the Antikythera Mechanism is the earliest extant construction of a deliberate differential gear scheme in history.|$|E

The Ephemerides is the earliest known astrological work from the Low Countries to carry an official notice of approval from the Roman Catholic Church. Gemma moved away from judicial astrology and renounced astrological predictions about political events, and seems to have gradually confined himself to predictions about astronomical phenomena and meteorological astrology. His predictions for 1561, for example, provided detailed information on every <b>lunar</b> <b>phase,</b> and most planetary aspects and phases of fixed stars {{in relation to the}} sun, with a thoroughness that surpassed the predictions of his contemporaries. He remained committed to astrologic medicine, however, and believed that predictable atmospheric conditions, extending to astral conjunctions, generated disease.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first part}} {{consists}} {{of determining the}} variable d, {{the number of days}} (counting from March 22) for the closest following full moon to occur. The formula for d contains the terms 19a and the constant M. a is the year's position in the 19-year <b>lunar</b> <b>phase</b> cycle, in which by assumption the moon's movement relative to earth repeats every 19 calendar years. In older times, 19 calendar years were equated to 235 lunar months (the Metonic cycle), which is remarkably close since 235 lunar months are approximately 6939.6813 days and 19 years are on average 6939.6075 days. The expression (19a + M) mod 30 repeats every 19 years within each century as M is determined per century. The 19-year cycle {{has nothing to do with}} the '19' in 19a, it is just a coincidence that another '19' appears. The '19' in 19a comes from correcting the mismatch between a calendar year and an integer number of lunar months. A calendar year (non-leap year) has 365 days and the closest you can come with an integer number of lunar months is [...] days. The difference is 11 days, which must be corrected for by moving the following year's occurrence of a full moon 11 days back. But in modulo 30 arithmetic, subtracting 11 is the same as adding 19, hence the addition of 19 for each year added, i.e. 19a.|$|E
60|$|It was no {{business}} of mine, {{and that was}} precisely why I could not keep out of it. Every enterprise that offered, allured just {{in so far as}} it was not my business. I still think that in a species of man, wherein I count myself, nothing so much matters as Unity of Being, but if I seek it as Goethe sought, who was not of that species, I but combine in myself, and perhaps as it now seems, looking backward, in others also, incompatibles. Goethe, in whom objectivity and subjectivity were intermixed I hold, as the dark is mixed with the light at the eighteenth <b>Lunar</b> <b>Phase,</b> could but seek it as Wilhelm Meister seeks it intellectually, critically, and through a multitude of deliberately chosen experiences; events and forms of skill gathered as if for a collector's cabinet; whereas true Unity of Being, where all the nature murmurs in response if but a single note be touched, is found emotionally, instinctively, by the rejection of all experience not of the right quality, and by the limitation of its quantity. Of all this I knew nothing, for I saw the world by the light of what my father had said, speaking about some Frenchman who frequented the dissecting rooms to overcome his dread in the interest of that Unity. My father had mocked, but had not explained why he had mocked, and I, for my unhappiness had felt a shuddering fascination. Nor did I understand as yet how little that Unity, however wisely sought, is possible without a Unity of Culture in class or people that is no longer possible at all.|$|E

40|$|Background and objectives: Oliveria decumbens {{belongs to}} Apiaceae family {{and is used}} in wide range of {{diseases}} such as gastrointestinal disorder. Several {{studies have shown that}} Oliveria decumbens essential oil possessed high amount of thymol and carvacrol but some other studies revealed that myristicin {{was one of the main}} components of the oil. The aim of the present study was investigation of the <b>lunar</b> <b>phases</b> effect on chemical composition and yield of the essential oil. Methods: Oliveria decumbens aerial parts were collected in three times based on the <b>lunar</b> <b>phases</b> (new moon, full moon and waning crescent) from the southwest of Iran. The essential oils of all three phases were obtained using hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Our results showed that the plant was collected in the full moon phase indicated the highest yielded of the oil (4 %), whereas the new moon showed the lowest yield (1. 2 %). Moreover, this investigation revealed that, the <b>lunar</b> <b>phases</b> significantly affected the main components of the oils. The full moon essential oil had high proportions of thymol and carvacrol (totally: 75. 09 %) and waning crescent volatile oil showed the lowest proportion (56. 92 %). It is noticeable that myristicin was in the highest amounts in waning crescent (15. 32 %) while being the lowest in the new moon phase (2. 01 %). Conclusion: According to the results, difference of the three essential oils may be due to the difference of the <b>lunar</b> <b>phases.</b> Complementary studies on the plant essential oil in the <b>lunar</b> <b>phases</b> are in progress...|$|R
