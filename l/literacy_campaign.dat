5|$|The Decree on Romanisation {{made this}} law in April, 1928. The Latin variant for Tajik {{was based on}} the work by Turcophone {{scholars}} who aimed to produce a unified Turkic alphabet, despite Tajik not being a Turkic language. The <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> was successful, with near-universal literacy being achieved by the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Across Cuba, anti-Batista groups {{carried out}} bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DR {{launched}} a failed {{attack on the}} presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Frank País was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Raúl were well known for their Marxist–Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist from The New York Times. Reporters from CBS and Paris Match soon followed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} Mongolian {{script was}} adapted from Uyghur script probably {{at the very beginning}} of the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the Mongolian Cyrillic script was declared mandatory by government decree. It has been argued that the 1941 introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign,</b> which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.|$|E
25|$|The FSLN's <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> sent {{teachers}} {{into the}} countryside and within six months, {{half a million people}} had been taught rudimentary reading, bringing the national illiteracy rate down from over 50% to just under 12%. Over 100,000 Nicaraguans participated as literacy teachers. One of the stated aims of the <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> was to create a literate electorate which would be able to make informed choices at the promised elections. The successes of the <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> was recognized by UNESCO with the award of a Nadezhda Krupskaya International Prize.|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{resurgence}} in the popularity of <b>literacy</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{as a means of}} mobilizing political will, resources and people. However, a recent analysis of adult <b>literacy</b> <b>campaigns</b> and programmes around the world from 2000 to 2014 found that most largescale campaigns failed to achieve their overly ambitious targets (Hanemann, 2015 a). The recommendations for policymakers outlined in this policy brief draw important lessons from this analysis and take into account the complexity of the literacy task ahead. Addressing the literacy challenge from a lifelong learning perspective will help policymakers to achieve the literacy target of the new global education agenda, Education 2030. This entails linking <b>literacy</b> <b>campaigns</b> to social change and mobilization; ensuring adequate investment; integrating literacy into holistic learning systems; making systematic use of technology; and improving the quality of literacy data...|$|R

25|$|Primary {{education}} is free in Nicaragua. A system of private schools exists, {{many of which}} are religiously affiliated and often have more robust English programs. As of 1979, the educational system was one of the poorest in Latin America. One of the first acts of the newly elected Sandinista government in 1980 was an extensive and successful <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign,</b> using secondary school students, university students and teachers as volunteer teachers: it reduced the overall illiteracy rate from 50.3% to 12.9% within only five months. This was {{one of a number of}} large-scale programs which received international recognition for their gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform. The Sandinistas also added a leftist ideological content to the curriculum, which was removed after 1990. In September 1980, UNESCO awarded Nicaragua the Soviet Union sponsored Nadezhda Krupskaya award for the <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Revolutionary Council {{established}} large-scale {{public works}} programs and successfully implemented an {{urban and rural}} <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign,</b> which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League (AL) in 1974. That same year, Barre also {{served as chairman of}} the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union (AU).|$|E
25|$|The {{agrarian reform}} {{had taken place}} near Herat without opposition, as there was little {{solidarity}} between the rural farmers, and the big landowners who mostly lived in the city. In this case the repression {{carried out by the}} Khalq against religious dignitaries, including Pir and Ulema, and traditional elites, is cited as a critical factor, as well as the government's <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign,</b> which had become controversial due in particular to the inclusion of communist propaganda in the literacy courses, as well as the practice of mixed-gender classes.|$|E

25|$|Sankara {{launched}} an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, {{one of the}} largest ever undertaken on the African continent.

His domestic policies included a nationwide <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign,</b> land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Ethiopian Revolution in 1974, the name of the university was changed to Addis Ababa University (AAU). By 1974, despite efforts by the government to improve the situation, less than 10 {{percent of the total population}} was literate. The national <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> began in early 1975 when the government mobilized more than 60,000 students and teachers, sending them all over the country for two-year terms of service. Most critics however saw this as the government's way to silence rising opposition while at the same time creating a network of government spys in the rural areas. Generally the campaign to increase literacy remained illusive even though government reports showed improvements.|$|E

It {{was one of the first}} languages the Derg selected for their <b>literacy</b> <b>campaign</b> (1979–1991). Welaytta pride in their written language led to a fiercely hostile response in 1998 when the Ethiopian government distributed textbooks written in Wegagoda – an artificial language based on amalgamating Wolaytta with several closely related languages. As a result, the textbooks in Wegagoda were withdrawn and teachers returned to ones in Wolaytta.|$|E
