40|$|The {{process of}} cutting the {{thin-wall}} pipes by twisting with the active counter pressure applied has been studied. The work {{is aimed at}} developing, studying and introducing the new technique of the wasteless pipe cutting by twisting. The mathematical model of pipes cutting under {{the conditions of the}} close twisting alloying to analytically determine the minimum <b>lentgh</b> of the deformation zone, has been suggested. The practical valueability of the work is that the new wasteless technique for the thin-wall pipes cutting as well as the construction of the stamp for its realization have been developed.

40|$|The {{world wide}} {{incidence}} of malignant melanoma – the most malignant tumor {{of the skin}} - is rising. Metastases of the tumor occurs frequently in the corresponding draining area of the lymph nodes. In the regional node basin the sentinel node {{plays a key role}} in the course of the disease. Only in early stages curative treatment of the tumor is possible. In case of lymph node metastases in the regional node basin a radical lymph node dissection of the regional node area is indicated. Following radical axillary lymph node dissection postoperative complications such as lymph fistulas, edema or seroma may occur, thus resulting in a prolonged placement of wound drains, diminished wound healing and finally an increased risk of minor or major wound infections. The described complications can challenge the treating surgeon and can be a reason for a prolonged hospital stay of the patient. Because of different published results concerning the described problem we conducted a blinded prospective trial to study the influence of a commercial available fibrin glue on the incidence of postoperative lymph fistula after radical axillary lymph node dissection. From Sept. 2003 to July 2005 in 58 patients a radical axillary lymph node dissection was performed. In 29 patients prior to wound closure fibrin glue (Tissucol® Duo S 2 cc Immuno) were sprayed into the wound. In the other group of 29 patients only wound irrigation with ringer solution was performed. In all patients we recognized the 1. 	length of drainage 2. 	drainage volume 3. 	<b>lentgh</b> of hospital stay 4. 	postoperative complications. After statistical evaluation of the obtained results it appaered, that the intraoperative application of 2 cc Tissucol® Duo S Immuno did not influence the <b>lentgh</b> of drainage (5 vs 5 days), the drainage volume (503 cc vs 410 cc) or the rate of postoperative complications. In addtion to this a significant reduction of the hospital stay was not achieved...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is not to develop new {{computational}} theories for regularization nor to construct new algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to try how different theories connect, and to describe them under one hat. Computational vision often needs to deal with derivatives of digital images. Derivatives are not intrinsic properties of a digital image; a paradigm is required to make them well-defined. Normally, a linear filtering is applied. This can be formulated in terms of scale space, functional minimization or edge detection filters. In this paper, we take regularization (or functional minimization) as a starting point, and show that it boils down to Gaussian scale space if we require the semi group constraint to be fulfilled, and if we associate a dimension of <b>lentgh</b> to parameter governing the regularization. This regularization implies the minimization of a functional which contains terms up to infinite order of differentiation. If the functional is truncated at [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A topological phase {{transition}} in two-dimensional nonlinear σ-models on tori, connected with self-dual (unimodular) 24 -dimensional Niemeier lattices, is considered. It is shown that critical properties of these transitions {{are determined by}} corresponding Coxeter numbers of lattices. A case of general integer-valued lattices with minimal norm equal 1 and 2 and a possible application to string theory are discussed. 1 This work is supported by RFBR grants 96 - 02 - 17331 and 96 - 1596861 1 Recently it was shown [1] (see also [2]), that two-dimensional nonlinear σ-models, defined on the maximal abelian Cartan tori TG of simple compact Lie groups G, have a topological {{phase transition}} with critical properties {{different from that of}} XY-model or of nonlinear σ-model on circle S 1 [3, 4] There are the universality classes of critical behaviour, determined by the type of the corresponding dual root lattices Lv, which can belong to the series An, Dn, En, Zn. More rigorously, all critical indices are determined by a set of minimal vectors and can be expressed through the Coxeter number hG of these lattices. For example, a correlation <b>lentgh</b> ξ as a function of temperature T (or equivalent coupling constant of the nonlinear σ-model) has an essential singularity ξ(T) ∼ a exp(Aτ −νG T − Tc), τ =, (1...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that, at a {{macroscopic}} level, the boundary condition for a viscous fluid at a solid wall is one of "no-slip". The liquid velocity field vanishes at a fixed solid boundary. In this paper, we consider the special case of a liquid that partially wets the solid, i. e. a drop of liquid in equilibrium with its vapor on the solid substrate has a finite contact angle. Using extensive Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we show that when the contact angle is large enough, the boundary condition can drastically differ (at a microscopic level) from a "no-slip" condition. Slipping lengths exceeding 30 molecular diameters are obtained for a contact angle of 140 degrees, characteristic of Mercury on glass. On {{the basis of a}} Kubo expression for δ, we derive an expression for the slipping length in terms of equilibrium quantities of the system. The predicted behaviour is in very good agreement with the numerical results for the slipping length obtained in the NEMD simulations. The existence of large slipping <b>lentgh</b> may have important implications for the transport properties in nanoporous media under such "nonwetting" conditions.

The corn-soy based diets were replaced with zero, 7. 5, 15 and 22. 5 % of each FFSB extruded at three temperatures during 15 - 21 d {{of age and}} AMEn and nutrients digestibility of EFFSB were calculated by regression analysis through extrapolation to 100 ٪ substitution in basal diet. The AMEn values of the FFSB samples extruded at 145, 155 and 165 o C obtained 3893, 3908 and 4037 kcal/kg, respectively and {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of dry matter and ether extract in FFSB samples extruded at 165 o C, was higher as compared to FFSB extruded at 145 o C. In the second experiment, the effects of 15 % FFSB extruded at three temperatures, evaluated on performance, ileal digesta viscosity and morphology of jejunum mucosa of broiler chickens. Weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio of 42 d chickens and ileal digesta viscosity of 21 d chickens were not affected by extrusion temperatures of FFSB.

Foram feitas amostragens mensais durante o ano de 1990 na região do Araçá, em frente à Ilha de Pernambuco (23 º 48 ' 57 ?S e 45 º 24 ' 27 "W), para constatar as associações entre as espécies de ermitão e as conchas de gastrópodes. Quatro espécies de ermitão foram encontradas, Clibanarius vittatus, C. sclopetarius, C. antillensis e Pagurus criniticomis. Para Clibanarius vittatus, por ser a espécie mais abundante, foram estudadas as relações entre as características morfométricas das conchas com o tamanho do animal e, em laboratório, observou-se a preferência por conchas de diferentes tamanhos e espécies. Todos os animais coletados foram medidos e diferenciados quanto ao sexo, e as respectivas conchas analisadas quanto ao comprimento total e abertura, peso e volume interno. As relações entre o comprimento total, peso e abertura das conchas e o tamanho de C. vittatus foram significativas. Machos e fêmeas ocupavam conchas de Siratus senegalensis e Cymatium parthenopeum semelhantes quanto ao comprimento e peso. Entretanto, quando utilizavam conchas de Stramonita haemastoma, as fêmeas ocupavam as maiores e mais pesadas. Em laboratório, os machos apresentaram preferências por conchas maiores que as das fêmeas. Estas apresentaram preferência por conchas de Cymatium, enquanto que no ambiente ocupavam especialmente conchas de Siratus. A oferta de conchas na natureza pode não estar suprindo as necessidades de conchas de tamanhos ideais para o macho, mas pode ser satisfatória às fêmeas. As preferências das fêmeas podem estar relacionadas com o custo energético de carregar uma concha pesada, além do peso dos ovos, durante a fase reprodutivaHermit crabs utilize empty {{gastropod}} shells {{to protect}} their vulnerable abdomen {{because of the lack}} of calcification. This association of crabs, and shells can influence many aspects of crab biology. Samples were collected monthly during 1990 at Araçá region, in front of Pernambuco island (23 º 48 ' 57 "S e 45 º 24 ' 27 "W), to verify the relationship between hermit crab, and shell species. Four hermit crab species were found, Clibanarius vittatus, C. sclopetarius, C. antillensis and Paguros criniticornis. For Clibanarius vittatus, the most common species, the relationship between shell character morphometrics, and animal size was studied. C. vittatus's preference for shells of different species, and sizes was also observed in laboratory. All the animals were measured, and sexed, and shells' attributes, such as total length, aperture length, weight, and internal volume were measured. The relationship between animal size, and total length, aperture <b>lentgh,</b> and weight of the shells were significant for C. vittatus. Shell utilization patterns in nature varied between sexes and shell species. Males and females utilized similar shells of Siratus senegalensis and Cymatium parthenopeum, for size and weight. However, the shells of Stramonita haemastoma were used, females occupied the bigger and heavier ones. In laboratory, males showed preference for bigger shells, where as females preferred shells of Cymatium although in nature they occupied mainly Siratus. The availability of shells in the environment may be not sufficient for the males, generally bigger than females. On the other hand, for females shells seem relatively available. The energetic costs of carrying a heavy shell (besides the eggs, during the reproductive phase) may determine the preference of female...|$|E
