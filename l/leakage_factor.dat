In this paper a new adaptive <b>leakage</b> <b>factor</b> variable tap-length learning algorithm is proposed. Through analysis the converged difference between the segmented mean square error (MSE) of a filter formed from a number of the initial coefficients of an adaptive filter, and the MSE of the full adaptive filter, is confirmed {{as a function of the}} tap-length of the adaptive filter to be monotonically non-increasing. This analysis also provides a systematic way to select the key parameters in the fractional tap-length (FT) learning algorithm, first proposed by Gong and Cowan, to ensure convergence to permit calculation of the true tap-length of the unknown system and motivates the need for adaptation in the <b>leakage</b> <b>factor</b> during learning. A new strategy for adaptation of the <b>leakage</b> <b>factor</b> is therefore developed to satisfy these requirements with both small and large initial tap-length.

This article proposes a method for attributing CDM-related market leakage effects to individual projects. To this purpose, alternative attribution methods are analysed. We find that project-specific approaches fail to take account of market leakage effects. Consequently, we propose to estimate aggregate market leakage effects and attribute them proportionally to individual projects.

Of course, this will result in lesser performance; however, the <b>leakage</b> <b>factor</b> is controlled, which is necessary to balance for the lost performance.
