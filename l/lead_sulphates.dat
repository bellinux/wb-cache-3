40|$|Historical {{stained glass}} {{has a clear}} {{tendency}} to form a crusted layer on its surface due to the environmental exposure. One of the most delicate aspects to be faced during the restoration of historic glass windows is the cleaning of these thick corrosion crusts. For several centuries, stained glass windows have been cleaned using damaging mechanical (scalpel) and chemical (high acidic or alkaline solutions) methods. Today's understanding of the cleaning process comprises two complementary aims: improving the readability of the glass and reducing the weathering process of the historical glass. The act of removing deposits and encrustations resulting from corrosion should not endanger the artwork itself. Mechanical methods, cleaning solutions or gel pads are now being developed. However, these methods could present further problems. In this study, we examine a new cleaning method that can be employed to remove encrustations in a quick and efficient way. Results up to now, obtained on specific stained glass windows are promising; further researches are in process for other cases. We propose an optimized solution to dissolve calcium carbonates and <b>lead</b> <b>sulphates</b> from Avila Cathedral glass windows crust. This system is tailored to control pH, temperature, conductivity and concentration of Ca 2 +. Continuous on-line analysis of these parameters allows us to monitor the cleaning process.

30|$|Red lead, or minium, has a {{long history}} of use in {{worldwide}} artistic and artisanal practices, although nomenclature issues are evident [1, 237, 238]. Its synthesis and relation with the other lead oxides is well described in literature [238]. As a pigment, it is not stable in fresco, or in watercolour. It was anyway used, for its optical properties and cheap price, compared to other red pigments [1, 120]. It is reportedly blackened on manuscripts and in glue tempera paintings exposed to light and humidity [1, 64]. On the other hand, it is reported that medium-rich proteinaceous red lead paints are stable to light, the binder protecting the pigment [239]. Moreover, the pigmented layer has different properties than an unpigmented one [51]. It is soluble in diluted acids (nitric, chloridric, oxalic, acetic), with formation of the corresponding salts, and when heated it transforms to litharge [1, 240]. It is sensitive to sulphur containing compounds, as H 2 S and SO 2 of atmospheric or biological origin, and pigments such as arsenic sulphides (AsxSy), vermillion (HgS) and ultramarine (Na 8 [Al 6 Si 6 O 24]Sn), especially in manuscripts, wall paintings, and in case the pigment is not mixed with a binder, which cause the formation of dark grey PbS [1, 60, 93, 124, 238, 241] and of whitish PbSO 4 [59, 68, 233, 242]. This was known to artists and artisans, as demonstrated by the presence of a blank space between yellow orpiment and red lead in a 12 th century illuminated manuscript, although mixtures of the two pigments do not behave consistently. The reaction between red lead and orpiment produced galena, which could further degrade into sulphates, and lead arsenate species [241]. Mimetite Pb 5 (AsO 4) 3 Cl was as well identified as a reaction product of minium and orpiment [186]. Moreover, it seems that minium promotes the blackening of leadwhite, when the pigments are mixed [204]. Some cases of red lead lightening are reported as well, and are related to the formation of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphates</b> and/or carbonates, according to the atmospheric pollutants and to the initial amount of PbO in red lead [68, 93, 200, 237, 238], via the formation of plumbonacrite [228].|$|E

30|$|The term “leadwhite” {{refers to}} a variety of white lead based materials, of which the most common, and most {{important}} from the artistic point of view is the basic lead carbonate corresponding to the mineral hydrocerussite (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) [1, 229], possibly including cerussite as well, according to the fabrication process [1, 20, 229]. Considering it is a carbonate, it is relatively stable, although soluble in acids [20, 98, 229]. Also, it shows catalytic effects [230]. Upon heating, massicot (orthorhombic PbO) is formed, then litharge (tetragonal PbO) and finally red lead (Pb 3 O 4) [229]. It was used in every medium. Black discolouration is observed on frescoes and watercolours [20], and it is reported for manuscripts as well [60, 231]. The blackening is attributed to the formation of either PbO 2, as a result of exposure to oxidizing agents or from microbiological activity, or PbS [9, 20, 98, 200, 211 – 213, 232]. The role of S-containing pigments on the blackening of leadwhite is not fully understood [191, 229], while atmospheric and biological sources of H 2 S strongly affect watercolours [20, 191, 231] and manuscripts [60, 190, 191, 204]. If PbS is formed, a reconversion treatment (oxidation) can be applied to restore the white shades of degraded polichromy. However, the formed lead sulphate (PbSO 4) is not sufficiently stable to make the treatment recommended [139, 212]. Humidity seems to be involved in many degradation processes, especially in synergy with atmospheric pollutants such as SO 2 and NOx [9, 64, 166]. The presence of sulphuric pollutants is responsible for the formation of lead sulphide, <b>lead</b> <b>sulphates,</b> and cerussite/hydrocerussite [124, 166]. The sensitivity of leadwhite to laser light was studied extensively, especially with respect to laser cleaning and laser based analysis of works of art, but the alteration process is not fully understood, the binding medium probably influencing the results [70, 142, 150, 210, 215, 233, 234]. Analytical evidence of formation of metallic lead and lead (II) oxides upon IR laser irradiation is provided in literature [70, 234]. A visible laser (632  nm) caused the appearance of a massicot-like alterations on leadwhite, possibly via a plattnerite (PbO 2) intermediate, which is related to impurities in the leadwhite [72]. Low fluence UV-laser does not affect paint layers prepared with different binders [235]. Moreover, the exposure of the PbO degradation to environmental conditions is likely to yield a carbonate-hydroxide lead salt, making the degradation reversible to some extent, especially in absence of a binder [19, 142, 234]. The influence of ion beam based analysis on polychrome objects can negatively affect leadwhite paint layers, as hydrocerussite is sensitive to PIXE analysis [151]. On wall paintings, the combined presence of humidity and salts can cause the formation of degradation products, sometimes coloured {{as in the case of}} NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 OH and PbO polymorphs, with cerussite being the most stable of them all [123, 218]. Leadwhite tempera and oil layers show the formation of lead soaps, which negatively affect the appearance of the paintings [55, 67, 226]. Leadwhite tempera applied on fresco paintings yields PbO 2, as the reaction takes place in alkaline environment [213]. Also, differences in naturally and artificially aged samples are observed, the latter being less degraded [230]. Lead oxalates were observed on leadwhite treated with oxalic acid [32], and on real samples [56]; lead acetate was detected upon exposure to acetic acid [109]. Plumbonacrite (3 [2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2]·PbO) was detected as well [56].|$|E

The reduction of. electrodeposited P-lead dioxide to <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> in 5 M sulphuric acid has been studied at the stationary and RDE. Potential step and sweep experiments have been made and {{a model for the}} discharge process of lead dioxide has been proposed based on charge transfer and limited high field conduction. T'he potentiostatic oxidations of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> overlying <b>lead</b> and lead dioxide have been investigated. The reduction behaviour of porous one-dimensional lead dioxide electrodes have been examined and shown to be independant of rotation speed in a large excess of 5 M sulphuric acid. The reduction peak was broadened by the porosity. This broadening was interpreted in terms of the reaction being driven more deeply into the pore structure as the front of the electrode becomes progressively more resistive. The effect of different potential sweep rates on the current response and effects of progressive redox cycles can be fully explained on this model. The potentiostatic oxidation of porous electrodes of lead dioxide containing <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> has also been investigated. The form of the current transient was found to depend on the balance of <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>lead</b> dioxide. Investigations have been carried out on the above electrodes using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy and alternating current. Possible interpretations of the results are discussed. The influence of the solid/porous material interphase on the electrode behaviour has been investigated for a variety of alloy supports with special reference to the charge output on reduction, ease of reoxidation and electrode support/porous phase adhesion.

Specifically, a relatively small boundary layer region around the particle is characterised by fast diffusion, and is thus considered quasistatic. In contrast, diffusion in the far-field is slower, and hence assumed to be time-dependent.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The electrochemistry of lead and porous lead electrodes has been examined using the techniques of linear sweep voltammetry, potential step and alternating current impedance at static and rotating disG electrodes. Investigations were made using sulphuric acid solutions at ambient and low temperatures. The behaviour of porous electrodes containing additives conventionally used to improve lead-acid battery redox processes were studied. Complementary data has been obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy and galvanostatic cycling experiments. The solution reaction at the porous electrode of typical commercial thickness, controlled by factors affecting the diffusion layer {{in a direction away}} from the porous fsce, was found to be insignificant in comparison with resctions occurring within the porous matrix. The thickness of PbS 04 films developed on the electrode is potentialdependent, with thicker films st lower potentials. The development of PbS 04 on the solid lesd electrode is controlled by nucleation and growth processes. At low overpotentials the process is three-dimensional but becomes two-dimensional at higher overpotentials. The behaviour of the porous electrode can be interpreted in terms of well-established porous electrode theory, assuming the same crystallisation processes are observed in the qaae of solid electrodes. On reduction at both solid and· porous <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> electrodes, the electrode process has a finite depth of penetration into the electrode. The kinetics of the formation of metallic <b>lead</b> from <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> on both types of electrodes appear to be by instantaneous nucleation and two-dimensional growth, with subsequent current limitations owing to overlap of growing lead and PbS 04 depletion. The current limitation processes are complex; the subsequent current decay rate varies with the porosity of the electrode. Ambient temperature investigations of the additives used in the commercial lead electrode demonstrated that lignosulphonate facilitated the nucleation of lead on recharge, and effected a progressive increase in surface area/porosity of the electrode. These effects promoted an increased utilisation of-,tbe electrode active material on discharge. BaS 04 was found to provide nucleation centres for PbS 04 formation.

40|$|Pigments {{and paint}} {{materials}} {{are known to}} be sensitive to particle irradiation. Occasionally, the analysis of paintings by PIXE can induce a slight or dark stain depending on the experimental conditions (beam current, dose, particle energy). In order to understand this discoloration, we have irradiated various types of art white pigments - lead white (hydroxycerussite and basic <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate),</b> gypsum, calcite, zinc oxide and titanium oxide - with an external 3 MeV proton micro-beam commonly used for PIXE experiments. We have observed various sensitivities depending on the pigment. No visible change occurs for calcite and titanium oxide, whereas lead white pigments are very sensitive. For the majority of the studied compounds, the discoloration is proportional to the beam current and charge. The damage induced by proton beam irradiation in lead white pigments was studied by micro-Raman and XPS spectroscopies. Structural modifications and dehydration were detected. Damage recovery was investigated by thermal treatment and UV-light irradiation. The discoloration disappeared after one week of UV illumination, showing that PIXE experiments could be safely undertaken for pigments and paintings...|$|R
40|$|A zinc-lead bulk {{sulphide}} concentrate from Kirki (Greece) was leached in {{aqueous solution}} with HClH 2 O 2 at atmospheric pressure and 95 °C to extract up to 97 % zinc, 40 % lead, 80 % silver and less than 12 % iron after 6 h. Highly pure PbCl 2 crystallized from the leach filtrate on cooling. Sulphur was oxidized to the elemental form; its loss as sulphate ion in solution and residue was 7. 5 %. During leaching no emission of H 2 S or SO 2 was detected. Conditions were determined for producing a pregnant solution (130 g/L Zn) low in iron and lead, to facilitate zinc extraction by electrolysis. Leaching experiments were conducted at 40 % solids, 0. 55 g HCl and 0. 26 g H 2 O 2 per gramme concentrate in a 1 -L reactor. After a second leaching of the residue {{in aqueous solution}} with HCl (1 M) for 1 h at 90 °C, the residual <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> was extracted, so that total lead recovery was over 98 %. Other values, such as silver and sulphur, could be recovered by additional treatment of either the leach solution or leach residue. © 1987...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of spent fuel elements is increasing {{due to the}} extended peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Of the numerous fission products, strontium has an interestingapplication potential as a radiation or energy source for utilization in various industrial fields. Anecessary condition for its use is its isolation in high radiochemicalpurity from the highly radioactive waste flow of the Purex process. In the present study, precipitation and coprecipitation reactions, and in particular ion exchange reactions, were chosen from among the various possible chemical and physical separation methods and examined {{with respect to their}} suitability for a selective separation of strontium from the other fission products. In selecting separation materials, particularly with respect to radiation resistance, thermal stability and selectivity, polyantimonic acid proved to be the best absorbent (even in avery acid medium) for strontium. Furthermore, the behaviour of the most important radionuclides was studied with respect to the denitration reaction from a 5 molar nitric acid solution. On the basis of the high demands made on the purity of the product, a method was developed by combining <b>lead</b> <b>sulphate</b> carrier precipitation with an ion exchange reaction on polyantimonic acid and is shown in a flow chart...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s white <b>lead</b> (<b>lead</b> carbonate/lead <b>sulphate)</b> was added in {{substantial}} quantities {{as the main}} white pigment in some paint products intended {{for use as a}} primer or top coat over metal and wood, both internally and externally. Examples of where this type of paint may have been used are skirting boards, doors, door frames, stairs, banisters, window frames and sills, wooden flooring, radiators, and pipes, though it could also have been applied to any other surface at this time e.g. plaster walls.|$|R
