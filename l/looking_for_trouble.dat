An erratic Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee DeFer) escapes the humiliation of being rejected by Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley). Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) reluctantly join forces after discovering the secret behind Charlie's behavior. Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenburg) unexpectedly turns up at the event <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Hawking told the Simpsons staff that he [...] "loved" [...] all the jokes {{and in an}} {{interview}} with The Guardian in 2005, he stated that his guest appearances on The Simpsons were [...] "great fun". An action figure based on Hawking's appearance in The Simpsons has been produced, with the figurine's computer screen reading [...] "If you're <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> you've found it", a line from [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain". Since [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain", Hawking has guest-starred three times on The Simpsons. In 2005, he appeared in the season 16 episode [...] "Don't Fear the Roofer"; in 2007, he starred in the season 18 episode [...] "Stop or My Dog Will Shoot"; and in 2010, he appeared in the Season 22 premiere [...] "Elementary School Musical".|$|E
2500|$|On December 14, 2016, Duterte gave {{a speech}} to {{business}} leaders in the presidential palace where he spoke of personally killing suspected criminals as Mayor of Davao {{to set an example}} for local police. He said, [...] "In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys that if I can do it why can't you. And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> also." ...|$|E

We'll turn them loose here, or build another corral. Hey, Blink?--How about a string for your ranch in Arizona?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, there's nothing {{come over}} me! Why do you <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> all the time?" [...] He was warning himself, [...] "Careful! Stop being so disagreeable.

2500|$|... "As I {{have said}} on {{numerous}} occasions, {{we are not}} going to stand for this in Birmingham. And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don't care whose toes we step on. I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best thing for them to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble.</b> And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it".|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the failure}} of the mud brick {{buildings}} and lack of compliance with the 1989 Iranian seismic code, the reconstruction in Bam paid special attention to using earthquake durable materials. Dr. Hamid Eskander, in charge of the Bam reconstruction effort, said [...] "There will be no more mud brick in Bam. The new design will {{have to take into account}} proper seismic design techniques and parameters. When you go with the old-style buildings and old-style engineering you're <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> so we're going to change it now." [...] Horst Indorf, a representative for permanent shelter issues from ASB, a German non-government organization, frowned on the use of iron structures in the city given its movement during an earthquake, saying [...] "The best architecture for this area is clay brick (with nets) but this means 80 to 90cm thick walls and a very good insulated roof".|$|E

50|$|Unger speculates on {{the quality}} that life would have under the regime instituted by a future {{religious}} revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble.</b> Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is all right," [...] the Princess said composedly. [...] "One would think that we were a pack of children, to take any notice of such trifles. It is too early, my dear Cecil, by many a day, to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> yet. Lord Ronald always wandered about pretty much as he chose. It will be months before--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but of course!" [...] Blood's irony {{laughed in}} his eyes. [...] "Yet, {{whatever}} you may be, I warn you {{that unless you}} yield to a demand that I consider just and therefore uphold, you may <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> {{and it would not}} surprise me if you never leave Cartagena at all, nor convey a single gold piece home to France." ...|$|R

6000|$|The meeting grew stormy. Williams, of Circle Bar, counselled moderation. Others {{were for}} {{beginning}} war at once. [...] "If {{this man is}} <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> he can easily find it," [...] one of them said.|$|E
25|$|Aerts {{played a}} fictionalized version {{of himself in}} the 2011 Dutch comedy film New Kids Turbo in which the protagonists, a group of guys who always <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> and create chaos in a small village, borrow some money from him. He is seen living in a villa, and in one scene he KO's {{one of the guys}} for refusing to give him the money back.|$|R

50|$|Five friends, Ale (Fathir Mochtar), Jarot (Vino G. Bastian), Lukman (Dion Wiyoko), Sadat (Ali Syakieb), and Jago (Dallas Pratama) {{live in a}} slum. They <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> fight, and extort merchants. With more {{leadership}} skills, Ale {{becomes the}} group's leader. He lives with his mother (Ully Artha), his little sister Aisyah (Fanny Fabriana), and little brother Bara (Agung Surya Putra). In the slum, there is a mute, Fathir (Reza Pahlevi), who lives with his grandmother. He is always mocked by the residents, including Ale, Lukman, Sadat, and Jago; however, Jarot often shows empathy to Fathir.|$|R

5000|$|Tintin's {{personality}} {{evolved as}} Hergé wrote the series. Peeters related {{that in the}} early Adventures, Tintin's personality was [...] "incoherent", in that he was [...] "sometimes foolish and sometimes omniscient, pious to the point of mockery and then unacceptably aggressive", ultimately just serving as a [...] "narrative vehicle" [...] for Hergé's plots. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted {{that in the early}} Adventures, Tintin showed [...] "little sympathy for humanity". Assouline described the character as [...] "obviously celibate, excessively virtuous, chivalrous, brave, a defender of the weak and oppressed, never <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> but always finds it; he is resourceful, takes chances, is discreet, and is a nonsmoker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we {{must start}} them our way," [...] {{declared}} Hopkins. [...] "I've got the order for these signs in my pocket, and I'll have 'em painted {{all over the}} district in a week.

5000|$|In the {{build-up}} to {{the third}} match, Jock Stein told reporters that Celtic wanted to win, [...] "not so much for ourselves but to prevent Racing from becoming champions". With regard to Racing Club's violent conduct in the previous two matches, Stein commented that Celtic's players would not <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> in the play-off game, but would [...] "give {{as much as they}} are forced to take." [...] Celtic, however, were satisfied with the safety precautions that were in place at the Estadio Centenario; the pitch was surrounded by a moat topped with a steel barrier and barbed wire, and the stands were much further back from the field than at Racing Club's ground, thus minimising the likelihood of any repetition of a player being struck by an object thrown by fans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{can tell}} you how to do her a good turn," [...] Pritchard continued, earnestly. [...] "Keep her away from that old blackguard. Keep her away from all the gang. Believe me, she is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> by even {{speaking}} to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, ho, eh?" [...] the man sneered. [...] "It's Fresh Dog <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble.</b> Well, {{you might}} as well get it over with now so your name can be changed to Good Dog.--My dear, just keep the rest of them in order while I teach Fresh Dog lesson number one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{agree with}} you, sir," [...] Jimmy declared, with most unusual seriousness. [...] "I don't {{like the way}} you are talking, and I'm dead off the B. & I. myself.

60|$|So Billy Mink {{jumped and}} skipped far ahead; Little Joe Otter ran; Jerry Muskrat walked, for he soon gets tired on land; Grandfather Frog hopped; Spotty the Turtle crawled, and way, {{way up in}} the blue, blue sky, OF Mistah Buzzard flew, all <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the <b>trouble</b> which had stopped the {{laughing}} of the Laughing Brook and the smiling of the Smiling Pool.|$|R
5000|$|She's cute, smart, and doesn't take {{anything}} from anyone. Pandora likes {{hanging out with}} her fellow freaks because they're more real than the other [...] "normal" [...] kids. She's only got one weakness: {{if there is a}} door closed, a locker locked, or a hallway hidden, Pandora will be hooked. She doesn't <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> but it sure knows how to find her... In this game Pandora is [...] "killed" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story so she appears as a ghost this time. The player mainly controls DJ but can switch to Pandora on the fly by simply tapping a symbol on the touch screen. Since Pandora is [...] "dead" [...] however the game will switch from material realm to spectral realm where the player has a limited time period to use Pandora's ghostly abilities to solve puzzles and open pathways through which DJ can progress.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess {{some folks}} are mighty stupid when they {{consider}} {{that only the}} ugly women are clever. There's my niece--well, nobody could call her plain, {{and you can see}} how she's taking hold instead of weakening. Some women never show the grit that's in them until they're fighting for their children; but you can <b>look</b> out <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> Thurston, if you fool away any chances, while Helen Savine's behind you fighting for her father." ...|$|R
60|$|Mike got {{up out of}} his chair. He {{could not}} quite follow what all this was about, {{but there was no}} mistaking the truculence of Adair's manner. For some reason, which might {{possibly}} be made clear later, Adair was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> and Mike in his present mood felt {{that it would be a}} privilege to see that he got it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{just comes}} to this," [...] he said. [...] "Torrance and the cattle-men have done their best to starve us and freeze us out, and, since he has made it plain that there's no room for both of us, {{somebody}} has got to go. Now, we {{have come a long}} way and we mean to stay. We're not <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> but we want our rights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at your Napoleon now. A great man. There is {{no denying}} it {{that he was a}} great man {{as long as he was}} content to thrash those Germans and Austrians and all those nations. But no! He must go to Russia <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> and what's the consequence? Such as you see me, I have rattled this sabre of mine on the {{pavements}} of Paris." ...|$|E
50|$|Bergman {{continued}} {{to improve his}} defensive and offensive roles on the team throughout the early 1970s. His well-rounded play made him useful on both the power-play and penalty-killing units for the Wings. Although he incurred his share of penalties, Bergman wasn't considered a surly opponent on the ice. He rarely <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> but also never backed down from an onrushing opponent, whether he was a fancy scorer or a power forward. While all eyes were on young superstars like Bobby Orr and Brad Park, the Red Wings were a mediocre team that {{continued to}} lose respect in the league, especially with the retirement of Gordie Howe. Bergman started turning to the community, becoming involved in many outside charities and organizations. He was particularly involved with helping disabled children and adults. He {{was one of the}} most liked NHLers off the ice due to his charity work and in 1973 he was named co-winner of the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award.|$|R
60|$|So {{running and}} walking and jumping and crawling, Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Jerry Muskrat, Grandfather Frog, and Spotty the Turtle hurried up the Laughing Brook {{to try to}} find out why it laughed no more. And high {{overhead}} in the blue, blue sky sailed Ol' Mistah Buzzard, and he also was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the <b>trouble</b> that had taken away the laugh from the Laughing Brook and the smile from the Smiling Pool.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{centralized}} around themes of danger and risk {{with regard to}} the group. In contrast, the band has explained that listeners should not take the song literally as it's promoting concepts of fun and youthfulness, and not the general idea of trouble. The song is mainly based on the chorus hook, [...] "‘I don't <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> me and it's been waiting around corners since I was 17," [...] which was deemed by music webzine The Turn Mag as an [...] "anthem for bad girls with good intentions." [...] Another key hook is its [...] "Hey, hey" [...] shouts which are chanted throughout the song. Bradley Stern of music website MuuMuse highlighted the verse [...] "People say I'm heartless, I just learned to use my heart less / I go hard 'cause I'm hardest and we ain't even started!" [...] as being big, bold and brag-like, in addition to deeming the song lyrically care-free. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner noted that the track's lyrics [...] "make you stand up and take notice." [...] The song has also been described as [...] "ballsy" [...] and [...] "in-your-face" [...] by other critics, while musically, [...] "Trouble" [...] is said to be both dancefloor and radio-friendly. The song has also been heavily compared to Spice Girls' [...] "Wannabe" [...] (1996), Girls Aloud's [...] "Sound of the Underground" [...] (2002), and Icona Pop's [...] "I Love It" [...] (2012), for sonic and lyrical similarities. Production-wise, [...] "Trouble" [...] has been deemed similar to that of Australian duo NERVO due to its [...] "pounding EDM energy." ...|$|R
