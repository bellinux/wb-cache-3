50|$|In June 1698, {{under orders}} from the Lords of the Admiralty, Dummer {{undertook}} a plan to survey various harbours along the south coast of England, {{at a time when}} a new war with France was a real threat, and Portsmouth would have been a major target. In the survey, he was assisted by Captain Thomas Wiltshaw, a fellow Navy Board Commissioner and two Masters of Trinity House, Captain James Conaway and William Cruft, who were assisting the Navy because of their navigational experience. The surveying was completed in the months of July and August 1698, with eighteen harbours being visited - the resulting charts appear to be rushed; on close examination they appear to be incomplete as in most cases they show few soundings, only the high and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>lines,</b> and few, if any, navigational features making it difficult for any large vessel to enter one of these so-called ports, but this was not the purpose of this undertaking. Dummer and Wiltshaw were looking for sites for new dockyards, and also to see if any of the existing smaller ports could be improved to accommodate larger vessels.|$|R
50|$|Tidelands are the {{territory}} between {{the high and}} <b>low</b> <b>water</b> tide <b>line</b> of sea coasts, and lands lying under the sea beyond the low-water limit of the tide, considered within the territorial waters of a nation. The United States Constitution does not specify whether ownership of these lands rests {{with the federal government}} or with individual states. Originally little commercial value was attached to tidelands, so ownership was never firmly established, but the coastal states generally proceeded {{as if they were the}} owners. Some states, such as Mississippi, directly administer these lands under the public trust doctrine.|$|R

50|$|Christmas Island {{consists}} of an uplifted limestone cap metamorphosed from coral reefs overlying more ancient volcanic andesite bedrock. The underlying seamount lies some 500 km southwest of Indonesia, and the isolation by the abyssal zone has led to endemism amongst the marine ecosystem. The park's boundaries extend 50 m beyond the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Approximately 46 km of the island's 73 km shoreline is within the park limits.|$|E
50|$|The {{limits of}} {{maritime}} boundaries {{are expressed in}} polylines and in polygon layers of sovereignty and control, calculated from the declaration of a baseline. The conditions under which a state may establish such baseline are described in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A baseline of a country can be the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> a straight baseline (a line that encloses bays, estuaries, inland waters,...) {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|E
2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and <b>low</b> <b>water)</b> which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high <b>water</b> cotidal <b>line,</b> which is directly opposite the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> cotidal <b>line.</b> High <b>water</b> rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.|$|R
50|$|The peak in {{dog whelk}} {{population}} density is approximately coincidental with the mid-tidal zone. It {{lives in the}} middle shore. In general {{it can be said}} that at high vertical heights on the shoreline the dog whelk is most threatened by biotic factors such as predation from birds and interspecific competition for food, but abiotic factors are the primary concern, creating a harsh environment in which it is difficult to survive. At low vertical heights it is biotic factors, such as predation from crabs and intraspecific competition, which cause problems. The upper limit of the range in which the dog whelk is generally found is approximately coincidental with the mean high <b>water</b> neap tide <b>line,</b> and the lower limit of the range is approximately coincidental with the mean <b>low</b> <b>water</b> neap tide <b>line,</b> so that the vast majority of dog whelks are found on the mid-tidal zone.|$|R

40|$|Terminal drought stress {{leads to}} {{substantial}} yield losses in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Water conservation at vegetative growth (canopy conductivity and canopy size and development) allow plants to increase soil water extraction during grain filling and are hypothesised to help chickpea adaptation to water limited environments. Plant vigour and water saving traits were phenotyped in 232 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), {{derived from a}} cross between ICC 4958 and ICC 1882, at 28 days after sowing under well water conditions using a high throughput phenotyping platform. Different density genetic maps (241 -SSRLow density, 1007 -SSR+SNPs-High density and 1557 -SNPs-Ultra high density) were used for QTLs identification. Several major QTLs (M-QTLs) for plant vigour traits (3 D-leaf area, shoot biomass, plant height and growth related traits) were identified on CaLG 04, and co-mapped with previously identified and fine mapped major drought tolerance QTL-hotspot region on CaLG 04 (300 Kb). The canopy conductance trait (e. g Transpiration rate) had a M-QTL mapped on CaLG 03 using ultra-high density bin markers. Plant vigour traits on CaLG 04 and canopy conductance related traits on CaLG 03 provide opportunity to manipulate these loci to tailor recombinants having lower transpiration rate and high plant vigour. This ideotype might be enhancing the water stress adaptation in chickpea. To test this hypothesis, a subset of 40 RILs contrasting for vigour and water use traits was tested in lysimeters and field under different water stress treatments. High vigour <b>low</b> <b>water</b> use <b>lines</b> had higher seed yield under severe water stress treatments than high vigour and high <b>water</b> use <b>lines,</b> validating the hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|This region extends {{over the}} eastern part of the {{district}} covering the entire Shujalpur tehsil and a small segment of Shajapur tehsil. Being a part of the Malwa plateau, it presents a dissected topography. A hill range enters this region from the north and extends towards the south. The southern part of the region is an upland area and northern part is relatively low lying. In the south, the hills are scattered and are eroded by various streams. The height at the region varies between 435 and 507 meters above the main sea level. The 450 meters contour encircles the area along the Newaj river where the small hills are spread, and the Newaj dissects these hills. The eastern part of the region is a <b>low</b> and <b>water</b> dividing <b>line</b> of the western part can be decided by the tributaries of Newaj. The river Newaj and Parbati drains the region.

5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot water. Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot <b>water</b> <b>line</b> siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> to return <b>water</b> back to the water heater. Hot <b>Water</b> <b>Line</b> Siphoning occurs when water from within the hot <b>water</b> <b>line</b> siphons or is forced into the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> due to differences in water pressure between the hot and cold <b>water</b> <b>lines.</b> Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot water out of hot <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> during cold <b>water</b> use.

5000|$|The pier, {{which cost}} £11,740 to build, {{originally}} {{consisted of a}} promenade 468 yd long and 9 yd wide, extending to 18 yd wide at the pier-head. The bulk of the pier was constructed from cast iron, with a wooden deck laid on top. The cast iron piles on which the structure rests were inserted using Birch's screw pile process; the screw-tipped piles were twisted into the sand until they hit bedrock. This made construction much quicker and easier, and guaranteed that the pier had a solid foundation. The cast iron columns, [...] in diameter, were filled with concrete for stability at intervals of 20 yd, and supported by struts that were on average were slightly more than [...] thick. The pier's promenade deck is lined with wooden benches with ornamental cast iron backs. At intervals along the pier are hexagonal kiosks built around 1900 in wood and glass with minaret roofs topped with decorative finials. On opening two of the kiosks were occupied by a bookstall and confectionery stall and the kiosks near {{the ends of the}} pier were seated shelters.The pier-head is a combination of 420 tons of cast iron and 340 tons of wrought iron columns; standing 50 ft above the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> it sees a regular 35 ft change in sea level due to the tide.|$|E
