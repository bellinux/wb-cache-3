5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 <b>lead</b> <b>at</b> the end of the half. Michigan regained the <b>lead</b> <b>at</b> 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E
