Although {{aerenchyma}} have received considerable attention in Zea mays, the signaling events and genes controlling aerenchyma induction remain elusive. Here, {{we show that}} Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls form <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma in response to hypoxia and that this process involves H 2 O 2 and ethylene signaling. By studying Arabidopsis mutants that are deregulated for excess light acclimation, cell death, and defense responses, {{we find that the}} formation of <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma depends on the plant defense regulators LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1 (LSD 1), ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS 1), and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD 4) that operate upstream of ethylene and reactive oxygen species production. The obtained results indicate that programmed cell death of <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma in hypocotyls occurs in a similar but independent manner from the foliar programmed cell death. Thus, the induction of aerenchyma is subject to a genetic and tissue-specific program. The data lead us to conclude that the balanced activities of LSD 1, EDS 1, and PAD 4 regulate <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma formation in response to hypoxia...|$|E

Seeds of the so-called 2 ̆ 7 glandless seeded 2 ̆ 7 Australian Gossypium L. species (Gossypium subgenus Sturtia (R. Br.)

The grain yield of P. miliaceum, S. glauca, and S. italica decreased 16, 18, and 4 %, while that of P. sumatrense increased 210 % under TT treatment and this showed P. sumatrense had most waterlogging tolerance.

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) can {{successfully}} germinate and grow even when flooded. Rice varieties possessing the Sub 1 A gene display a distinct flooding-tolerant phenotype, {{associated with a}} lower carbohydrate consumption and restriction of the fast-elongation phenotype typical of flooding-intolerant rice varieties. CIPK 15 was recently indicated as a key regulator of α-amylases under O 2 deprivation, linked to both rice germination and flooding tolerance in adult plants. It is still unknown whether the Sub 1 A and CIPK 15 mediated pathways act as complementary processes for rice survival under O 2 deprivation. In adult plants Sub 1 A and CIPK 15 may perhaps play an antagonistic role in terms of carbohydrate consumption, with Sub 1 A acting as a starch degradation repressor and CIPK 15 as an activator. In this study, we analysed the sugar metabolism in the stem of rice plants under water submergence by selecting cultivars with different traits associated with flooding survival. The relation between the Sub 1 A and the CIPK 15 pathways was investigated. The results showed that under O 2 deprivation, the CIPK 15 pathway is repressed in the tolerant, Sub 1 A-containing, FR 13 A variety. CIPK 15 is likely {{to play a role}} in the up-regulation of Ramy 3 D in flooding intolerant rice varieties that display fast elongation under flooding and that do not possess Sub 1 A. In rice plant, <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma formation is a constitutive trait. Under water submersion, aerenchymatous areas are further enhanced likely to support the internal movement of gas. This phenomenon is promoted by ethylene that accumulates within the plant tissues under water submersion, but variation in the genotype response suggests further hypothesis. In Arabidopsis hypocotyls, a dual mechanism involving both ethylene and hydrogen peroxide signaling regulates the <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma formation under hypoxic condition. This hypothesis was investigated in the leaf sheets of the rice varieties FR 13 A and Arborio Precoce, showing different traits in flooding tolerance in terms of internode elongation and survival. Both the varieties displayed constitutive <b>lysigenous</b> arenchyma formation that was further enhanced under flooding. Arborio Precoce, characterised by a fast elongation when submerged, showed an active ethylene biosynthetic machinery associated with increased aerechymatous areas. FR 13 A, limiting the growth during oxygen deprivation, didn’t show any raise in the ethylene production.

40|$|To {{adapt to}} waterlogging, maize (Zea mays) forms <b>lysigenous</b> {{aerenchyma}} in root cortex {{as a result}} of ethylene-promoted programmed cell death (PCD). Respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) gene encodes a homolog of gp 91 phox in NADPH oxidase, and has a role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, we found that during aerenchyma formation, RBOH was upregulated in all maize root tissues examined, whereas an ROS scavengingrelated metallothionein (MT) gene was downregulated specifically in cortical cells. Together these changes should lead to high accumulations of ROS in root cortex, thereby inducing PCD for aerenchyma formation. As further evidence of the involvement of ROS in root aerenchyma formation, the PCD was inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Based on these results, we propose a model of cortical cell-specific PCD for root aerenchyma formation...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Rice {{is one of}} the few crops able to {{withstand}} periods of partial or even complete submergence. One of the adaptive traits of rice is the constitutive presence and further development of aerenchyma which enables oxygen to be transported to submerged organs. The development of <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma is promoted by ethylene accumulating within the submerged plant tissues, although other signalling mechanisms may also co-exist. In this study, aerenchyma development was analysed in two rice (Oryza sativa) varieties, ‘FR 13 A’ and ‘Arborio Precoce’, which show opposite traits in flooding response in terms of internode elongation and survival. Methods The growth and survival of rice varieties under submergence was investigated in the leaf sheath of ‘FR 13 A’ and ‘Arborio Precoce’. The possible involvement of ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated in relation to aerenchyma formation. Cell viability and DNA fragmentation were determined by FDA/FM 4 - 64 staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. Ethylene production was monitored by gas chromatography and by analysing ACO gene expression. ROS production was measured by using Amplex Red assay kit and the fluorescent dye DCFH 2 -DA. The expression of APX 1 was also evaluated. AVG and DPI solutions were used to test the effect of inhibiting ethylene biosynthesis and ROS production, respectively. Key Results Both the varieties displayed constitutive <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma formation, which was further enhanced when submerged. ‘Arborio Precoce’, which is characterized by fast elongation when submerged, showed active ethylene biosynthetic machinery associated with increased aerenchymatous areas. ‘FR 13 A’, which harbours the Sub 1 A gene that limits growth during oxygen deprivation, did not show any increase in ethylene production after submersion but still displayed increased aerenchyma. Hydrogen peroxide levels increased in ‘FR 13 A’ but not in ‘Arborio Precoce’. Conclusions While ethylene controls aerenchyma formation in the fast-elongating ‘Arborio Precoce’ variety, in ‘FR 13 A’ ROS accumulation plays an important role...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{regulation}} of environmentally induced cell death and signaling of systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) in Arabidopsis thaliana is characterized. We used the lesion simulating disease 1 (lsd 1) mutant as {{a model system that}} is deregulated in light acclimation and programmed cell death (PCD). In this system we identify that redox status controlling SAA and cell death is controlled by the genes LSD 1, EDS 1, EIN 2 and PAD 4 which regulate cellular homeostasis of salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), auxin (IAA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore we propose that the roles of LSD 1 in light acclimation and in biotic stress are functionally linked. The influence of SA on plant growth, short-term acclimation to high light (HL), and on the redox homeostasis of Arabidopsis leaves was also assessed. SA impaired acclimation of wild-type plants to prolonged conditions of excess excitation energy (EEE). This indicates an essential role of SA in acclimation and regulation of cellular redox homeostasis. We also show that cell death in response to EEE is controlled by specific redox changes of photosynthetic electron transport carriers that normally regulate EEE acclimation. These redox changes cause production of ET that signals through the EIN 2 gene and regulon. In the lsd 1 mutant, we found that propagation of cell death depends on the plant defence regulators EDS 1 and PAD 4 operating upstream of ET production. We conclude that the balanced activities of LSD 1, EDS 1, PAD 4 and EIN 2 regulate chloroplast dependent acclimatory and defence responses. Furthermore, we show that Arabidopsis hypocotyls form <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma in response to hypoxia and that this process involves H 2 O 2 and ET signalling. We found that formation of <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma depends on LSD 1, EDS 1 and PAD 4. Conclusively we show that LSD 1, EDS 1 and PAD 4, in their functions as major plant redox and hormone regulators provide a basis for fundamental plant survival in natural contitions...|$|E

40|$|Members {{of the genera}} Hieracium and Pilosella are model {{plants that}} are used to study the {{mechanisms}} of apomixis. In order to have a proper understanding of apomixis, knowledge about the relationship between the maternal tissue and the gametophyte is needed. In the genus Pilosella, previous authors have described the specific process of the "liquefaction" of the integument cells that surround the embryo sac. However, these observations were based on data only at the light microscopy level. The main aim of our paper was to investigate the changes in the integument cells at the ultrastructural level in Pilosella officinarum and Hieracium alpinum. We found that the integument peri-endothelial zone in both species consisted of mucilage cells. The mucilage was deposited as a thick layer between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The mucilage pushed the protoplast to the centre of the cell, and cytoplasmic bridges connected the protoplast to the plasmodesmata through the mucilage layers. Moreover, an elongation of the plasmodesmata was observed in the mucilage cells. The protoplasts had an irregular shape and were finally degenerated.

Both cellulase activity and cell death were inhibited in hypoxic roots in the presence of antagonists of inositol phospholipids, Ca 2 +- calmodulin, and protein kinases. By contrast, there was a parallel promotion of cellulase activity and cell death in hypoxic and normoxic roots by contact with reagents that activate G-proteins, increase cytosolic Ca 2 +, or inhibit protein phosphatases. Most of these reagents had no effect on ethylene biosynthesis and did not arrest root extension. These results indicate that the transduction of an ethylene signal leading to an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + is necessary for cell death and the resulting aerenchyma development in roots of maize subjected to hypoxia...|$|E

In the leaf sheath of these species, especially grasses, <b>lysigenous</b> gas cavities (gas spaces) are developed into intervascular spaces and provide a gas conducting system to non-aerial parts under flooded conditions. The spatial relationship between gas space formation and transverse vein differentiation was investigated using the leaf sheath of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Histochemical observation showed that patterns of differentiation of the transverse vein are distinct from those of vertical vascular bundles. On the other hand, gas spaces are formed through the processes of cell death (collapse). Both events are initiated at a specific cell position in the middle layers of the leaf sheath, from which the vascular system of the leaf is derived; this indicates that differentiation of transverse veins is associated with gas space formation. The cell-to-cell movement of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran injected into middle layer cells coincided with the area where cell collapse occurred, indicating a close relationship between the middle and adaxial cell layers, but not abaxial cell layers. A uniform cell number between each transverse vein in the leaf sheath suggested the involvement of spatial regulation in transverse vein formation regardless of clonal history at the later stage of leaf vein canalization...|$|E

For this reason this species was described as andromonoecious. The ovary is apocarpous, constituted by 4 - 5 carpels, while the style and the stigma are coherent. Considering their ontogeny and organization, the ovules are constituted by two units: the nucellar one, formed by nucella and inner integument; and the funicular one, that includes chalaza and external integument. The position of exostome near the hilum is in accordance with an anatropous ovule. However, due to the combination of all these characteristics the ovule of  S. striata  is described as hemianatropous. The ovule displays a very prominent exostome that persists in the seed as a caruncle. It also presents an obturator of placentarian origin. The fertilization is acrogamous. Three phases of the ovule and seed ontogeny were detected: initial, where nucella is curved until 90 º; prefertilization, where the external integument continues its growth until the exostome is closed at 180 º; and posfecundation, where the nucelar unit retakes the erect position and the embryo is inverted {{with respect to the}} hilum.

Dissecting the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling rice root development is critical {{for the development of}} new rice ideotypes that are better adapted to adverse conditions and for the production of sustainably achieved rice yield potential. Most knowledge regarding the gene networks involved in root development has been accumulated in the model dicotyledon plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice, the model monocotyledon species, presents several singularities compared to A. thaliana, including a root architecture characterized by a fibrous root system comprising five types of embryonic and postembryonic roots. The anatomy and morphology of the rice root system, which is typical for a cereal, differs from that of A. thaliana, for instance, by the presence of a <b>lysigenous</b> cortex and additional cell layers compared to the dicotyledon model. Moreover, the structure and functions of the root apical meristem (RAM) of rice are distinct from those of A. thaliana. Recently, several rice root mutants have been identified via forward or reverse genetics, and these will aid in forming hypothesis to characterize either the divergence or conservation of genetic pathways relative to A. thaliana. Furthermore, these mutants will help to identify key genes in rice roots that may be missing in A. thaliana. This review summarizes both classical and recent data concerning the molecular genetics of rice root development, including root anatomy and morphology, RAM structure, RAM patterning, and root mutants.|$|E

The disease, {{originally}} named Aleppo pine tuberculosis (from tubercle, i. e. knot) by Petri in 1924, causes a hyperplastic growth on the twigs and small branches, with knots that initially are small, green and lignified, and expand to 5 – 6 cm diameter at maturity.

In this study, only one bacterium was isolated from Aleppo pine knots, and this bacterium was constantly associated with the pine weevil Pissodes castaneus.

Bacteria were grouped in zoogloeae in the intercellular spaces or inside <b>lysigenous</b> cavities. Bacterial microcolonies have also been observed in the parenchyma cells. Inoculation of two of the bacterial strains on healthy Aleppo pine twigs did not induce knot formation.

Although its root functions are thought to be very important for the enormous shoot growth, the morphological and anatomical studies are limited. This study investigates external and internal structures of sago roots with reference to their functions to distinguish two types of roots in each plant; i. e., large (about 6 - 11 mm diameter) and small (about 4 - 6 mm diameter) roots. Large roots were adventitious roots whose primordia were formed just inside the epidermis in the stem, emerged from the trunk surface and grew downward into the soil. Small roots were lateral roots whose primordia were formed on large roots running horizontally or on other small roots, grew not only downward and obliquely in both deep peat and mineral soils, but also right above in deep peat soils.

40|$|When soil is flooded, the {{rhizosphere}} quickly reaches oxygen shortage conditions {{because of}} oxygen consumption {{during the early}} stages of flooding, not only by plant roots but also by soil micro-organisms. Although this environment is generally disadvantageous to plant growth, hygrophytes and some mesophytes can adapt to these conditions. In these plants, aerenchyma (tissue with much enlarged gas space) develops in the petioles, stems and roots, and enhances transport of atmospheric and photosynthetic oxygen to flooded tissues, thereby preventing serious damage to root organs (Armstrong, 1979; Dacey, 1980; Drew et al., 1985; Drew, 1997). On the other hand, many mesophytes have little ability to develop aerenchyma so, if the soil becomes flooded, their roots may become oxygen starved and damaged (Smirnoff and Crawford, 1983; Justin and Armstrong, 1987; Laan et al., 1989). Therefore, aerenchyma formation is thought {{to be one of the}} important morphological adaptations to hypoxic stress. Two main types of cortical aerenchyma in stems and roots can be distinguished by their process of formation: <b>lysigenous</b> and schizogenous aerenchyma (Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003; Visser and Voesenek, 2004; Seago et al., 2005). The former is created through cell disintegration (death) in the primary cortex of adventitious roots, as in rice (Justin and Armstrong, 1991), maize (Drew et al., 1979, 1981) and wheat (Huang et al., 1997), whereas the latter is formed by the separation of cells from each other, often accompanied by cell divisions and normal expansion as in Rumex species (Laan et al., 1989; Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Colmer et al., 2004). The anatomical and morphological formation of both types has been reported in detail. In particular, much research has been done on the regulation of <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma formation using the roots of maize (Drew, 1997; Gunawardena et al., 2001) and rice (Kawai et al., 1998). However, another type of cortical aerenchyma was described in roots of Jussiaea (now Ludwigia) species by Martins (1866) and Schenck (1889). 100 years ago. Some Ludwigia species have pneumatophores (respiratory roots) that grow vertically upward and emerge above the water surface as in mangrove plants (Hartsema, 1927; Sculthorpe, 1967). The intercellular gas spaces are produced by radial elongation of living, thin-walled primary cortical cells. These aerenchymatous tissues are composed of a regular meshwork of rectangular spaces, and are produced in concentric layers in transverse sections of the roots (Martins, 1866; Schenck, 1889; Ellmore, 1981). The elongated cells appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections (Haberlandt, 1914). Although the variation is different from that of Ludwigia, recently intercellular gas space shave been shown to be produced by primary cortical cell elongation in adventitious roots of the wetland plant Pontederia cordata (Seago et al., 2000) and is termed ‘expansigenous aerenchyma’ by Seago et al. (2005). Sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica, Cucurbitaceae) is an annual vegetable upland crop that originates in India and southern Asia, and is distributed mainly in tropical to warm-temperate areas. Compared with bitter melon (Momordica charantia), this species is flood tolerant, but its morphological changes in response to flooding stress have not been examined (Liao and Lin, 1996). In Taiwan, yield of bitter melon is increased by grafting with Luffa spp., which allows bitter melon to survive in flooded soils (Palada and Chang, 2003). In sponge gourd, it was found that the primary cortical tissues of newly formed adventitious roots under flooding created an aerenchyma that was neither schizogenous nor <b>lysigenous,</b> but took the form of elongated cortical aerenchyma. This aerenchyma is composed of cells that appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections. According to Jost (1887), intercellular gas spaces are created by T-shaped cells in roots of Luffa amara (now L. acutangulus). T-shaped cells that are secondary tissues derived from a phellogen are also observed in flooded stems of Ludwigia (Schenck, 1889, see the English text in Arber, 1920), and the lacunate tissues seem to be similar to elongated primary cortical aerenchyma. However, the origin of the lacunate tissues in the stem of Ludwigia is strikingly different from that of aerenchyma observed in sponge gourd. Recently, morphological observations of T-shaped cells derived from a phellogen were reported in the root and stem of Decodon species (Little and Stockey, 2003, 2006) and Lythrum salicaria (Stevens et al., 1997), but there was no detailed observation of T-shaped cells derived from primary cortical cells. Ellmore (1981) described elongated cortical aerenchyma in mature pneumatophores of Ludwigia, but did not report how lacunae were created at an early stage; therefore, an investigation has been carried out to determine the developmental processes of this type of aerenchyma. In addition, it was found that such tissues were composed of radially elongated primary cortical cells in flooded hypocotyl of sponge gourd, but not of T-shaped cells. Here, the morphological changes in flooded tissues and the pattern of cortical aerenchyma formation are described for sponge gourd, and the relative amount of aerenchyma is analysed...|$|E

The model is based on the biomechanics of plant cells in tissues. The main merit of this algorithm is that it can account for typical differences in intercellular air space networks and in cell size and shape found between different fruit species and tissues. The cell is considered as a closed thin walled structure, maintained in tension by turgor pressure. The cell walls of adjacent cells are modeled as parallel, linear elastic elements which obey Hooke's law. A 3 D Voronoi tessellation is used to generate the initial topology of the cells. Intercellular air spaces of schizogenous origin are generated by separating the Voronoi cells along the edges where three Voronoi cells are in contact; while intercellular air spaces of <b>lysigenous</b> origin are generated by deleting (killing) some of the Voronoi cells randomly. Cell expansion then results from turgor pressure acting on the yielding cell wall material. To find the sequence of positions of each vertex and thus the shape of the tissue with time, a system of differential equations for the positions and velocities of each vertex is established and solved using a Matlab ordinary differential equation solver. Statistical comparison with synchrotron tomography images of fruit tissue is excellent. The virtual tissues can be used to study tissue mechanics and exchange processes of important metabolites. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecently {{the world}} has been {{entangled}} by insufficient food such as the lack of rice which threatens the safety of world food and affect sustainable development of the world economy, resulting in rising of food price. To address this issue, cotton appears as a possible source of both fiber and food. The research in recent years indeed showed bright prospects for this expectation. However, gossypol stored in the glands of cotton is toxic to nonruminant animals and humans, which wastes large amounts of cottonseed protein that could potentially provide the annual protein requirements for half a billion people. Gossypium species are characterized by their <b>lysigenous</b> glands containing terpenoid aldehydes, important secondary phytoalexins consisting mainly of gossypol, which constitute one of the important plant's defense system against pests and diseases. The best approach to address this issue is to create glandless seed and glanded plant cotton. A breakthrough in this field would realise the fulfilment of making cotton both a fiber and a food crop, which would be a feat of great magnitude for sustainable development of agriculture. Research on the relationship between glands and their secondary inclusions at the molecular level would be one approach for genetic engineering to control the glands and gossypol content. In this article, we review recent progress on glands and gossypol content for diverse gland types in Gossypium species, inheritance of glands and gossypol content, traditional breeding of glandless seeds and glanded plant cotton, the terpenoid aldehyde biosynthesis pathway, molecular cloning of the related genes, the strategy for genetic engineering, and future prospects...|$|E

The leaf shedding behaviour and morphological traits that may contribute to adaptation to low oxygen levels were studied at the Ilha de Marchantaria on the lower Solimoes-Amazonas river, Brazil, and in greenhouse experiments with cuttings of six tree species typical of the Amazon floodplain. Comparison of deciduousness in situ revealed that four of the species under investigation, Salix martiana, Tabernaemontana juruana, Laetia corymbulosa and Pouteria glomerata, are able to maintain their leaf system during the aquatic period. Adventitious roots were formed by S. martiana and T. juruana, but anatomical characteristics differed between the species. Whereas S. martiana developed <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma in its roots during aerobic and anaerobic growth, only small intercellular spaces of schizogenous origin were formed in the root cortex of T juruana. Similar to the latter species, such spaces were constitutively formed in the deciduous species Crateva benthami and Vitex cymosa. Suberin deposits were observed in tangential and radial cell walls of the hypodermis of roots from T juruana, L. corymbuloso and P. glomerata. Suberin deposits were less pronounced in roots of S. martiana and absent in V. cymosa and C. benthami. The data show that different, almost contrasting, survival mechanisms have evolved in roots of plants with similar life forms in the same habitat. The results further suggest that the morphological traits of the investigated trees are causally linked with the in situ leaf shedding behaviour...|$|E
40|$|A cell growth {{algorithm}} for virtual leaf tissue {{generation is}} presented {{based on the}} biomechanics of plant cells in tissues. The algorithm can account for typical differences in epidermal layers, palisade mesophyll layer and spongy mesophyll layer which have characteristic differences {{in the shape of}} cells, arrangement of cells and void fractions present in each layer. The cell is considered as a closed thin walled structure, maintained in tension by turgor pressure. The cell walls are modelled as linear elastic elements which obey Hooke's law. A Voronoi tessellation was used to generate the initial topology of the cells in the spongy mesophyll layer. Then two layers of brick structured cells are added to the top of it to represent the palisade mesophyll and upper epidermis and a single layer is added at bottom of the Voronoi tessellation to represent the lower epidermal layer. Intercellular air spaces are generated by separating the Voronoi cells along the edges starting from where three Voronoi cells are in contact (schizogenous origin) and/or by deleting some of the Voronoi cells (<b>lysigenous</b> origin). Cell expansion then results from turgor pressure acting on the yielding cell wall material. To find the sequence of positions of each vertex and thus the shape of the tissue with time, a system of differential equations for the positions and velocities of each vertex is established and solved using the ordinary differential equation solver in MatLab. Statistical comparison of the cellular characteristics with 2 D cross-sectional slices of real leaf tissue of tomato is excellent.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the other ground tissues, the mesodermis is composed of four to five cell layers in the radicle, which will differentiate into a lysigenous–schizogenous aerenchyma with intercellular spaces that develop into large lacunae. First, during mesodermis differentiation, the cells become round and spaces between cells are generated. These intercellular spaces are called schizogenous spaces. Later, programmed cell death of mesodermal cells produces cellular spaces called <b>lysigenous</b> spaces. Lysogeny results in a typical radial morphology that includes strands of surviving cortical cells separated by gas spaces [23]. Aerenchyma {{is regarded as a}} tissue that is devoted to gas exchange from the shoot and acts as a reservoir of oxygen that is required for root respiration under flooding conditions. Development of the aerenchyma is observed in several aquatic plants species and can also be induced by submergence or anoxia in maize [87]. In comparison, aerenchyma formation is constitutive in rice, and cell death is assumed to represent a part of the developmental process. The aerenchyma is visible in all rice root types, excluding the small lateral roots that possess no mesodermis layer. Finally, the innermost cell layer of the ground tissue system is the endodermis. Endodermal cells contain the Casparian strip, which is made of suberin and surrounds the entire cell. The Casparian strip was more developed when the roots were grown in soil but remained poorly developed when the roots were fostered under hydroponic conditions. Endodermal cells represent a resistant apoplastic barrier to water and nutrition flow and are known to ensure selective transfer through cell symplasts between the mesodermis and the central cylinder (Fig.  3 b).|$|E
40|$|Mealiness causes {{fruit to}} develop a soft and dry texture during ripening. No {{technique}} currently exists to detect mealiness non-destructively. Two studies were conducted to i) determine the potential of X-ray macro computed tomography (macro-CT) to detect mealiness in ‘Forelle’ pear (Pyrus communis L.) nondestructively, and to ii) establish histological differences between mealy and non-mealy fruit using X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT). Scans were made after 8 and 11 weeks of cold storage at - 0. 5 °C {{and at the end}} of shelf life of 7 days. Total porosity, pore size distribution and connectivity of cells were measured on regions of interest (ROI) cubes excised from the neck and equator of individual fruit. Macro-CT scans showed the presence of structural disorders in the cortex tissue, identified by micro-CT as large pores, in mealy fruit. These pores were already present at the end of cold storage before fruit would become mealy. Statistical differences with fruit which would ripen and become juicy were significant (P < 0. 05). The disorder appeared more clearly in the neck than in the equator region of the cortex. At the end of shelf life, porosity was significantly higher in mealy than non-mealy fruit. Micro-CT results confirmed that tissues of mealy fruit were more porous than those of non-mealy fruit, with a larger proportion of pores greater than 56. 53 mm. Evidence was found of <b>lysigenous</b> pore formation in mealy fruit. Cells of mealy fruit were larger and oval-shaped while non-mealy fruit cells were more spherical. Xray computed tomography was shown to be a promising technology for the non-destructive determination of mealiness at an early stage. status: publishe...|$|E

Morphological features and oxygen distribution patterns {{were correlated with}} metabolic changes under hypoxia, such as alterations in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and adenylate energy charge (AEC) of root cells. Salix martiana (Leyb.) was able to react to hypoxic growth conditions with formation of adventitious roots rich in <b>lysigenous</b> aerenchyma, which facilitates root aeration by longitudinal oxygen transport and rhizosphere oxidation by radial oxygen loss (ROL). The oxygen concentration {{on the surface of}} adventitious roots of S. martiana reached 2 - 3 mg O 2 L– 1. The low resistance to gas exchange in Salix roots was reflected by low ADH activities, which ranged between 0. 03 - 0. 1 μmol NADH mg – 1 min– 1, and AEC values of 0. 8 - 1 under hypoxic conditions. Adventitious roots were also formed by Tabernaemontana juruana ([Markgr. ] Schumann ex. J. F. Macbride) during growth under low-oxygen conditions, although at a later stage. The gas-space continuum in roots of T. juruana was less pronounced, resulting in a 10 -fold lower oxygen concentration in the root cortex under oxygen stress compared with adventitious roots of Salix. The lower oxygen content was reflected in 6 -fold higher ADH activities and decreased AEC values. ROL occurred only at the non-suberized root tip, suggesting that the suberized hypodermis functions as a barrier against gas exchange between the root and the rhizosphere. These findings indicate that different strategies of adaptation to low oxygen levels are realized in the two species under investigation that occur naturally in the same ecosystem but inhabit different elevation site...|$|E
40|$|Food {{security}} {{is one of}} the most important challenges that society will continue to face in a world with a rapidly expanding population coupled with a growing affluence. Cottonseed is an underutilized source of protein and oil which could play a key role in human and non-ruminant animal nutrition if the toxic polyphenol gossypol contained in <b>lysigenous</b> glands throughout the plant could be removed from the seed. Gossypol is a terpenoid that protects cotton plants against insects and pests and if removed from the vegetative portion of the plant, the plant becomes highly susceptible to attacks. Scientists at Texas A&M University used RNAi technology to develop transgenic cotton plants, which have normal gossypol levels in vegetation but ultra-low levels in seed. The main objective of this study was to assess the traits function in multiple genetic backgrounds. Transgenic lines were field tested in 2011 and 2012 near College Station, TX. Performance parameters such as yield, lint percent and crop maturity were measured as well HVI fiber properties. Also, recurrent parents were tested in a three-year field trial and several methods for screening for the ultra-low gossypol cottonseed (ULGCS) trait were evaluated. Results from these studies suggest the ULGCS trait can be backcrossed into diverse upland cotton lines without interfering with the inherent performance of the recurrent parent. Moreover, during the backcross process, selections can be made to improve fiber quality and abiotic stress tolerance. Availability of a food product such as cottonseed can have numerous positive effects on local economies where cotton is grown and in the lives of millions of people who cannot fulfill one of the most important and basic rights of humanity: access to food...|$|E
40|$|Study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which some environmental parameters influence oil yield in the newly established tea tree oil industry. Young oil glands of Melaleuca alternifolia possessed a densely cytoplasmic epidermal lining, and cell fragments were observed in mature glands indicating a <b>lysigenous</b> mode of formation. The glands were capped by modified epidermal cells. Oil was observed to pass through these cells when the leaf was subjected to vacuum. The yield and composition of tea tree oil was recorded over a 48 hour period and showed no significant variation. Short term (8 days) water stress did not affect oil yield or composition. Further, varying nitrogen and phosphorous nutrition and light levels over a three month period did not influence oil gland density or oil yield from leaves formed under the imposed conditions. The lack of a diurnal variation in oil content, together with observations of the mode of formation and development of the gland and effects of environmental conditions on oil gland density and oil yield, support the concept of a one way developmental pathway for oil gland formation and oil content. Thus the oil yield of a leaf should be determined by the growth conditions prevailing at the time of leaf expansion, gland formation and oil synthesis. Oil gland initials were first apparent in immature leaves (c. node 3) within shoot apical growth of Melaleuca alternifolia. Glands continued to form, while density per unit area decreased, as the leaf expanded. Under the growth conditions employed, a maximum number of ca. 550 glands was reached as the leaf matured at node 12. Variation in the number of glands present in the most recently fully expanded leaf was less within a plant than between plants of the same seed source, indicating a genetic component to oil gland density. Micropropagation of M. alternifolia Cheel. (tea tree) was achieved using nodal explants from mature trees. A culture procedure involving nodes sourced from 1. 5 to 3 cm fromthe shoot tip, cultured into a shoot induction medium of MS basal salts supplemented with 1 mg. L-¹ 6 -benzylaminopurine and 60 mM sucrose for 12 weeks, followed by subculturing for root induction on medium containing MS basal salts, 60 mM sucrose and 0. 1 or 1 µM indole acetic acid for 8 weeks, is recommended. A comparison of the source of explant material and the form of cytokinin and mineralised nitrogen on the production of multiple shoots per node was made. Further, an investigation of the effect of shoot induction treatment, the age of plant used for explants and the value of the presence of charcoal, sucrose and light on subsequent root formation in plantlets is reported...|$|E
40|$|Aerenchyma is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} specialised plant tissue containing large intercellular air spaces. It is mostly renowned {{for its ability to}} increase gas conductance of those plant parts in which it occurs. Although aerenchyma is a typical feature of many wetland species worldwide, it can also be found in other plants among which many Bromeliaceae. In mature Guzmania plants the aerenchyma consists of a network of openly arranged stellate cells, creating large intercellular spaces, traversing the whole leaf length. Remarkably, this mesophyll tissue was not traced in young plants. The commercial production chain for Guzmania is characterised by a number of critical points at which the specific culture conditions sometimes change drastically, which might induce aerenchyma occurrence. Therefore, the first objective of this research was to investigate the leaf anatomy of plants situated at these critical points in the production chain with attention for the various environmental conditions possibly affecting aerenchyma occurrence. The second objective was unraveling the specific function of the aerenchyma. It was proposed that together with the chlorenchyma, it plays an undeniable role in photosynthesis. More specifically, chlorenchyma might be responsible for light captation, while the aerenchyma is important for gas exchange and Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 /* Style Definitions */ table.

Moreover, it was investigated if the function of the aerenchyma was related to the typical tank habit of Guzmania. The formation of aerenchyma can proceed through a <b>lysigenous</b> or schizogenous pathway. In Guzmania the aerenchyma is of the schizogenous type. During differentiation of aerenchyma cells, unequal growth of the cell surface creates bulges at certain points, which further develop into long arms. The tips of adjoining arms remain connected with one another, creating intercellular air spaces. This process of differentiation, which takes place already in the smallest non chlorophyll containing leaves, gives rise to the specific form of aerenchyma cells in Bromeliaceae. Ontogeny was found to have a pronounced influence on aerenchyma occurrence in Guzmania ranging from no aerenchyma in small plants to a large amount of well developed aerenchyma in older developmental stages. Moreover, at a certain stage during ontogeny aerenchyma arises as a simple structure. The presence of this transitional aerenchyma in fully developed leaves indicates that it is not involved in the progressing formation of the aerenchyma discussed above. The possibility exists that it concerns a transitional leaf type, but the true significance remains to be resolved. The presence of photosynthetic proteins in the chloroplasts of aerenchyma and chlorenchyma of Guzmania shows that both mesophyllic cell types play a role in photosynthesis.

Conversely, shade acclimation leads to thinner leaves with lower amounts of aerenchyma. When light levels are low, less photosynthesis takes place, which may lead to lower gas diffusion and hence, a lower need for aerenchyma tissue. Other environmental factors do not affect the aerenchyma development. Neither do the specific in vitro culture conditions influence theoccurrence of the aerenchyma in Guzmania. No definite relation could be established between the aerenchyma and juvenility. We believe the aerenchyma develops constitutively as plants gain biomass and increase their leaf thickness massively during ontogeny. Thickness of the leaves renders gas exchange considerably more difficult. Our interpretation is that the aerenchyma represents a unique solution to the existing trade-off between thick leaves and sufficient gas exchange as it offers the necessary thickness and rigidity to the leaves, {{while at the same time}} ensuring adequate gas diffusion throughout the leaf. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{production}} of pome fruits is both season and location dependent calls for preservation methods {{to maintain the}} quality of the produce after harvest. The principal method to preserve pome fruit is postharvest storage in cool rooms under Controlled Atmosphere (CA) or Ultra Low Oxygen (ULO) conditions. These methods are based on empirical trials to determine optimum storage conditions for a specific cultivar in terms of temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration and relative humidity. Improved understanding of the underlying fruit physiology in relation to the gas and water exchange processes during storage will assist in improving postharvest quality and reducing the occurrence of storage disorders. Both experimental and modeling approaches have been followed to investigate the relationship between the gas concentration, gas diffusion, respiration and physiological disorders in apple and pear. Experimental approaches are, however, costly, tiresome and time consuming. Moreover, it is difficult to investigate the time course of the physiological disorders experimentally {{because of the lack of}} non-destructive techniques to measure the internal gas concentration in the fruit. Alternatively, mathematical models can be used to study gas and water exchange. They are usually based on the continuum hypothesis where the fruit is considered as a material with transport properties that are independent of the spatial scale. However, unlike the traditional engineering materials fruit tissue has a complex fine structure. The cellular architecture is believed to determine to a large extent the biophysical processes in the fruit. The continuum hypothesis does not hold in this case and a multiscale approach is required in which the model parameters of the model that operates at the macroscale  the scale of interest  are obtained from simulations with a microscale model that incorporates the actual microstructure of the fruit. For the latter, microscale geometric models of the fruit are required. Pome fruit tissue microscale geometry generators exist today but are based on digitized 2 D or 3 D images of the cellular architecture. Therefore, although these algorithms generate representative geometries of the tissues, they require experimental input in terms of microscopic images. These approaches need complex image acquisition procedures and expensive infrastructures such as synchrotron radiation sources. Also, they do not allow to parameterize the microscale geometry to, for example, investigate the effect of cell size or shape on the transport properties in a systematic way. The main objective of this dissertation was to develop virtual microscale fruit tissue generators (algorithms) that generate statistically and spatially equivalent virtual tissue microstructures resolving the cell symplast, cell wall and intercellular air spaces in both 2 D and 3 D and interface them to finite element and/or finite volume codes. To achieve this, we have developed virtual tissue generators that are based on cell growth modeling bytaking into account cell biomechanics. The generators are initiated from a random Voronoi tessellation and growth biomechanics is applied to the tessellation which results in a virtual tissue that has equivalent geometrical properties as that of real tissues obtained from microscopic or synchrotron microtomography images. In a further extension we have also developed a cell division algorithm which is based on cell biomechanics and that is capable of mimicking both symmetric cell division and asymmetric cell division with different degree of anisotropic growth. The cell division algorithm can be used instead of the Voronoi tessellation as an input for the expansive growth models. Initial tessellations obtained from the cell division algorithm will have more realistic representation of the cells than the Voronoi tessellations. The geometric models can be used to carry out in silico simulations to determine transport properties to be used in multiscale framework of gas and moisture exchange studies in pome fruits. This approach helps to include more geometrical details and fewer assumptions than the classical continuum modeling approach, while requiring less computer time compared to solving governing model equations at the resolution of the microscale.
