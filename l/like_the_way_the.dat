Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave {{the impression that the}} album would be completed as rapidly as in six months, but [...] " [...] took a slow spiral downhill". Recording for the album was halted during the summer when Manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003. On September 10, a backhoe careened into the outer walls of Smart Studios, causing extensive damage. Both Garbage and the band Paris, Texas had been working on their albums. The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, [...] "there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn't agree on songs". Manson suffered writer's block and had trouble writing lyrics, and Vig did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> songs sounded. The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit. Duke Erikson said that nobody could agree about the music's direction, and the band {{was on the verge of}} breaking up. He said, [...] "when you lose that common bond of the music, you've got nothing".
