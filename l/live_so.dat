5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia <b>live</b> <b>so</b> that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of Old Louisville by the wealthy was {{a reflection of}} changing lifestyles brought on by technology. Many homes of Old Louisville were originally built as mansions that would require several servants to maintain. Because of the relatively high wages offered by manufacturing jobs, servants were no longer affordable to all but the wealthiest families by the mid-20th century. Interurban rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that the wealthy {{no longer had to}} <b>live</b> <b>so</b> close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county's east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to <b>live</b> <b>so</b> close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals like giant tortoises can <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E

25|$|ClassesT and L {{could be}} more common {{than all the other}} classes {{combined}} if recent research is accurate. Study of the number of proplyds (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously speculated. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a protostar, which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us. Because brown dwarfs can <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long, these smaller bodies accumulate over time.|$|E

The same ship is prepared yet again and Thorstein sets sail with a crew of 25 and his wife Gudrid (ON: Guðríðr). The expedition never reaches Vinland and after sailing the whole summer, the ship ends up back at the coast of Greenland. During the winter, Thorstein falls ill and dies but speaks out of his dead body and tells the fortune of his wife Gudrid. He predicts that Gudrid will marry an Icelander and have {{a long line of}} “promising, bright and fine, sweet and well-scented” descendants. Thorstein also predicts that she will leave Greenland for Norway and from there she will set out for Iceland. She will, however, <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long that she outlives her husband. Once her husband passes, Thorstein foresaw, she would travel abroad once again, going south on a pilgrimage and then return to her farm in Iceland. When she returns, a church will be built. From the time it is built until she dies, she will remain there and take holy orders.|$|E

He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to <b>live,</b> <b>so</b> that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E

He then goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring the year before. Eric forces the owner, Gideon, to return the ring. Eric then tosses rings telling Gideon each {{of them is a}} life - a life Gideon helped destroy. He lets Gideon <b>live</b> <b>so</b> that he can warn the others and blows up his shop. Eric then meets up with Albrecht, explains who he is and why he is here. Eric finds Funboy getting high with Sarah's drug-addict mother, Darla. After killing Funboy with an overdose of morphine, Eric talks to Darla, taking the drug out of her arm seemingly by magic and making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. He later visits Albrecht, at his house. Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched as she suffered for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him the pain felt by Shelly during those hours. The next day, Sarah and her mother begin to repair their strained relationship. Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and talks to him. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric explains that, even though they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything <b>live,</b> <b>so</b> I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872.

[...] Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it will seem when remembered". In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from an Old Volume of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E

500|$|Although monastic chroniclers {{after the}} Norman Conquest {{accused him of}} crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any {{evidence}} of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views tend {{to see him as}} either a wily politician and indifferent bishop, or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his [...] "whole career shows that he was essentially a politician". Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that [...] "Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power." [...] Another historian, Eric John, said that [...] "Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom". However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that [...] "he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was [...] "unlucky to <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms".|$|E
500|$|The best-known {{and most}} widely {{credited}} {{suggestion is that}} made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book De döda på Vitön ("The Dead on Kvitøya") in 1952: that the men succumbed to trichinosis, which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of Trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundström and Sundman both favor this explanation. Critics note that the diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat {{in exactly the same}} area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions have included vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andrée to have been aware of this danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. [...] The chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in the tank when found. [...] Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. Lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as are scurvy, botulism, suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favoured by Kjellström is that of cold and hypothermia as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment. Kjellström argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. [...] "Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvitøya, surrounded by food," [...] writes Kjellström. [...] "The surprise is rather that they found the strength to <b>live</b> <b>so</b> long" [...] (p.54).|$|E
