25|$|Business {{enterprises}} contributed 59.1 % of US GERD in 2012, {{down from}} 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute {{a small fraction}} of total R, 3.3% and 3.8% respectively. The USA has historically been a leader in business R and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the US recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business ‘deaths’ began overtaking the number of business ‘births’ and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries <b>like</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R spending were in agriculture production: -3.5% compared to the average R to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.|$|E

2500|$|Keynesian {{economic}} theory has {{played an important}} role in the economic philosophy of modern American liberals. Modern American liberals generally believe that national prosperity requires government management of the macroeconomy, in order to keep unemployment low, inflation in check, and growth high. They also value institutions that defend against economic inequality. In The Conscience of a Liberal Paul Krugman writes: [...] "I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it." [...] Liberals often point to the widespread prosperity enjoyed under a mixed economy in the years since World WarII. They believe liberty exists when access to necessities <b>like</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and economic opportunity are available to all, and they champion the protection of the environment.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Price {{sought the}} {{position}} of Republican Conference Chairman, which would have made him the fourth highest ranking Republican in the House. He was endorsed by Ryan, {{as well as by}} the Tea Party-affiliated organization FreedomWorks, conservative political commentator Erick Erickson, future Vice-President and then-governor of Indiana Mike Pence, and outgoing Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Ryan said of Price, [...] "He was instrumental in drafting our House Republican budget. His vocal leadership on issues <b>like</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> tax reform, and fiscal matters has been vital to our messaging and policy efforts. No one will work harder than Congressman Price at building a strong and compelling communications and policy strategy that reflects the will of our membership and the needs of the nation." [...] Although then-Speaker of the House John Boehner did not publicly endorse anyone in the race, he was seen as preferring Price's challenger for the position, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and offered Price a separate position if he dropped out of the race for Conference Chairman - Price turned down the offer. He lost the election to McMorris Rodgers in November.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} DADT, {{approximately}} 114,000 servicemembers who {{had been}} separated from military service since WW II under the categories [...] "other than honorable discharge", [...] "general discharge", or [...] "dishonorable discharge" [...] became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits <b>like</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and tuition assistance, {{and the lack of}} an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board. In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin) and Charles Rangel (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because [...] "without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration." [...] The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013. On January 30, 2014, Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.|$|E
