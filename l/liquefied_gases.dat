2500|$|Butane (...) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C4H10 {{that is an}} [...] alkane with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. [...] The term may refer to either of two structural isomers, n-butane or isobutane [...] (also called [...] "methylpropane"), or to a mixture of these isomers. In the IUPAC nomenclature, however, [...] "butane" [...] refers only to the n-butane isomer (which is the isomer with the unbranched structure). Butanes are highly flammable, colorless, easily <b>liquefied</b> <b>gases</b> that quickly vaporize at room temperature. The name butane comes from the roots but- (from butyric acid, named after the Greek word for butter) and -ane. It was discovered by the chemist Edward Frankland in 1849.|$|E

50|$|Gas {{carriers}} built between 1976 and 1986 (the GC Code)The regulations covering {{gas carriers}} built after 1976 but before July 1986 {{are included in}} the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk. It is known as the Gas Carrier Code or GC Code in short.Since 1975, International Maritime Organization (IMO) has approved four sets of amendments to the GC Code. The latest was adopted in June 1993. All amendments are not necessarily agreed by every government. Although this Code is not mandatory, many countries have implemented it into national law. Accordingly, most charterers will expect such ships to meet with Code standards and, as proof of this, to have on board a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk.|$|E
50|$|The {{convention}} also distinguishes substances {{based on}} whether they are transported in bulk or in packaged form.

40|$|Abstract. To a {{great extent}} ， traffic {{accidents}} of <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> tankers are caused by the defects inside the tankers themselves. Analyzing what causes the defects, and putting forward the corresponding prevention measures, to reduce accident risk, is of great significance. In this paper, the research object is a defective <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> tanker in a propylene factory in Shandong. The defects in actual transportation process containing weld joints defects and anti-wave plates are analyzed, and the corresponding solutions are put forward {{on the basis of}} the literature analysis. The results show that the main causes of the defects are that the manufacture and processing did not correspond with design data. The defects repair of the <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> tanker should be performed by qualified service units after specific repair plan and relevant formalities are put forward. The repaired <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> tanker should be inspected qualified by the inspection organizations...|$|R

50|$|Gas {{carriers}} {{built before}} 1977 (the Existing Ship Code)The regulations covering gas carriers built before 1977 {{are contained in}} the Code for Existing Ships Carrying <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk. Its content {{is similar to the}} GC Code, though less extensive.The Existing Ship Code was completed in 1976 after the GC Code had been written. It therefore summarises current shipbuilding practice at that time. It remains as an IMO recommendation for all gas carriers in this older fleet of ships. The Code is not mandatory but is applied by some countries for ship registration and in other countries as a necessary fulfilment prior to port entry. Accordingly, many ships of this age are required by charterers to meet with Code standards and to have on board a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk.|$|E
50|$|The Code which {{applies to}} new gas {{carriers}} (built after 30 June 1986) is the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk. In brief, this Code {{is known as}} the IGC Code. The IGC Code, under amendments to International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), is mandatory for all new ships. As proof that a ship complies with the Code, an International Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of <b>Liquefied</b> <b>Gases</b> in Bulk should be on board.In 1993, the IGC Code was amended and the new rules came into effect on 1 July 1994. Ships on which construction started on or after 1 October 1994 should apply the amended version of the Code but ships built earlier may comply with previous editions of the IGC Code.|$|E

50|$|Cryogenic fuels are fuels {{that require}} storage at {{extremely}} low temperatures {{in order to}} maintain them in a liquid state. These fuels are used in machinery that operates in space (e.g. rocket ships and satellites) because ordinary fuel cannot be used there, due to absence of an environment that supports combustion (on earth, oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere, whereas in human-explorable space, oxygen is virtually non-existent).
