25|$|The {{economy of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire was based on agriculture, mining, {{traditional}} crafts, and trade. Agriculture and <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> remained the mainstays of the Bulgarian economy between the 12th and 14th centuries. Moesia, Zagore, and Dobrudzha were known for rich harvests of grain, including high quality wheat. Production of wheat, barley, and millet was also developed in most regions of Thrace. The main wine-producing areas were Thrace, the Black Sea coast, and the valleys of the Struma and Vardar rivers in Macedonia. Production of vegetables, orchards, and grapes became increasingly important {{since the beginning of}} the 13th century. The existence of large forests and pastures was favorable for <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding,</b> mainly in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions of the country. Sericulture and especially apiculture were well developed. Honey and wax from Zagore were the best-quality bee products in the Byzantine markets and were highly praised. The forests produced wood for cutting (бранища); there were also fenced forests (забели), in which wood-cutting was banned.|$|E

25|$|Food {{availability}} {{relates to}} the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange. Food production is determined {{by a variety of}} factors including land ownership and use; soil management; crop selection, breeding, and management; <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> and management; and harvesting. Crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures. The use of land, water, and energy to grow food often competes with other uses, which can affect food production. Land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification, salinization, and soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices. Crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security. Nations don't have to have the natural resources required to produce crops in order to achieve food security, as seen in the examples of Japan and Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of whether there are any ethical duties toward animals was hotly debated, and the arguments in dispute were quite {{similar to the ones}} familiar in modern discussions on animal rights. Vegetarianism was usually part and parcel of religious convictions connected with the concept of transmigration of the soul (metempsychosis). There was a widely held belief, popular among both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, that in the Golden Age of the beginning of humanity mankind was strictly non-violent. In that utopian state of the world hunting, <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding,</b> and meat-eating, as well as agriculture were unknown and unnecessary, as the earth spontaneously produced in abundance all the food its inhabitants needed. This myth is recorded by Hesiod (Works and Days 109sqq.), Plato (Statesman 271–2), the famous Roman poet Ovid (Metamorphoses 1,89sqq.), and others. Ovid also praised the Pythagorean ideal of universal nonviolence (Metamorphoses 15,72sqq.).|$|E
25|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are maracuja (passion fruit), an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> techniques have also been adopted. This project under the aegeis of IFAD, has been found successful in increasing the incomes and purchasing power of the farmers and pastorals.

500|$|Historically {{the region}} has been a centre of Bulgarian culture. Strandzha is {{inhabited}} by three ethnographic groups— the Ruptsi, Tronki and Zagortsi. The Strandzhan or Eastern Ruptsi (called this way to distinguish them from the Rhodopean Ruptsi) are considered {{the largest of the}} three groups. The etymology of the name is linked to the word ropa or rupa, which means a [...] "mine shaft" [...] in the local dialects. They have preserved some vestiges of the pagan religious traditions and rites of the Antiquity. They speak the Strandzha dialect {{which is part of the}} Rup dialects and has preserved many words from the Old Bulgarian language. The traditional Ruptsi settlements in the park are Balgari, Brashlyan, Byala Voda, Gramatikovo, Kalovo, Kondolovo, Malko Tarnovo, Rezovo, Slivarovo, Stoilovo, Vizitsa, Zabernovo and Zvezdets. After 1913 the Ruptsi who inhabited the territory of modern Turkey settled in the north-western regions of Strandzha. Their main occupation was <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding,</b> and especially sheep breeding, logging, charcoal production and mining. The second largest group are the Tronki who inhabit mainly the areas to the north and to the west of the park in Sredets Municipality. They made a living mainly in agriculture but also in sheep and cattle breeding. The Zagortsi inhabit the regions to the north of the park and are thought to have migrated from north-eastern Bulgaria.|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} {{technological advances}} of World War II displaced the Nonius {{as a military}} horse, {{and it was then}} directed towards agriculture instead. However, the depredations of the war severely damaged the breed, {{and by the time the}} war was over, there were only around 50 mares of the breed left. However, the damage that the property, supplies, and livestock of Mezőhegyes suffered during the war were steadily rebuilt up through the 1960s, and by 1954 there were 120 mares at the Mezőhegyes stud alone. Communist Hungary was not supportive of horseback riding, and in the years between 1947 and 1961, more Hungarian horses were killed for meat than were casualties of the war. Attempts to produce sport-oriented horses from Nonius stock were largely unsuccessful, though during the 1970s combined driving emerged as a popular horse-sport at which the Nonius could excel. In 1989 the Nonius Horse Breeders National Association was formed to protect the purebred Nonius horse. In 1999, UNESCO named the Hortobágy National Park to the World Heritage List (WHL), due in part to its history of <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding,</b> including such breeds as the Nonius horse and Mangalitsa pig.

In his lecture Memoir upon {{the formation of a}} deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883, he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of <b>livestock</b> <b>breeding</b> which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, {{under the auspices of the}} American Breeders' Association. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans. From 1912 until 1918, he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a [...] "defective variety of the human race". By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.|$|E
