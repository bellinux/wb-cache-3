In their six-week lifespan, (specific length may differ {{as a result of}} temperature, weather, etc.) females lay egg masses typically consisting of 50-200 eggs. Different species within this genus exhibit varying egg <b>laying</b> <b>procedures.</b> The species Chrysomya bezziana, for example, lay their eggs exclusively on live mammals. In contrast, most Chrysomya species prefer to perform oviposition on dead organisms. And, as with many fly genera primary and secondary myiasis is possible but unlikely.|$|E

However, the increasing demands on quality and durability of pavements lead lo {{the need of}} a profound knowledge in the physicochemical changes of the materials which constitute these AR binders. In this work several base bitumens interacted with crumb rubber {{in order to produce}} AR binders, which were subsequently separated, by using a modified “Basket drainage method” to recover the residual bitumens. The effect of aging during the <b>laying</b> <b>procedures</b> was also studied by using the RTFOT test. Additionally, a new “Sphere AR production simulator” method was developed to simulate the bitumen aging without the contribution of the rubber The DSR was used lo evaluate the chemical and rheological changes in the properties of AR binders.

40|$|In {{selective}} laser sintering (SLS) a laser beam is used to partially melt particles in a layer of powders [1]. With subsequent increments of powder layers {{it is possible to}} create three dimensional structures. This technique can be used in prototyping applications able to produce customized objects of predetermined shape. With SLS it is possible to process powders polymer, ceramics and metal, therefore it appears to be particularly suited to build three dimensional scaffolds made of biocompatible materials. In SLS techniques increasing the energy transferred by laser increases the strength of the structure obtained, but it also produces a volume contraction of the sintered material which reduces the precision of the final object [2]. Since the energy required for sintering depends on the particle size. The use of smaller particles allows the use of smaller sintering energies and therefore the production of complex and more precise structures due to reduced melting. In this paper powders with different particle size distributions of silicon were obtained by mixing a coarser grained powder, with particles in the range between 10 and 100 microns, and a finer grained powder, with particles in the submicron range. The powder composition and the powder <b>laying</b> <b>procedure</b> were studied and optimized in order to obtain specimens with of the desired mechanical properties. The equipment used is a three dimensional laser sintering equipment using a 40 W CO 2 laser beam purposely built.

A simple model approach is used to estimate the strength of the single sintered contact...|$|R

40|$|A lay {{adjudication}} {{system that}} {{has been the subject of}} international and domestic reforms democratising criminal justice procedures often reveals a challenging balance amongst the intertwined principles of criminal procedures. In addition, the various stages of <b>lay</b> adjudication <b>procedures,</b> such as its introduction, practice, development, and abolition, have been influenced by political and societal force. Lay adjudicator participation may be an important mechanism for introducing and sustaining the concept of democracy in criminal trial procedures. Whilst the establishment of well-balanced links between international fundamental human rights principles, efficiency and popular justice are significant features in judicial reforms internationally and domestically, the introduction of a <b>lay</b> adjudication <b>procedure</b> can be an appealing addition to judicial reform. A fundamental concern is whether it represents a successful mechanism for democratising criminal procedures. This thesis addresses the issue by examining the 'Saiban-in no Sankasuru Keijisaiban ni kansuru Horitsu', promulgated in 2009, as a result of the 1999 judicial reform in Japan. It does this by firstly setting out evaluative criteria developed through an examination of theoretical perspectives of lay adjudication. It then applies these criteria using quantitative data derived from the Japanese Supreme Court and qualitative data from interviews with former citizen judges and legal professionals who have experience of citizen judge trials. It argues that the introduction and practice of the citizen judge system has been successful. Both procedural and practice tests of the citizen judge system have shown the extent to which citizen judge participation has been accepted and has achieved its targets. The representative and engaging format of the citizen judge system has led to satisfaction and confidence in their duties as citizen judges. However, powerful controls by legal professionals have remained in place throughout the four stages of the citizen judge procedures - the pre-trial arrangement conference process, the selection process of citizen judges, the decision-making process, and the post-trial phrase. Moreover, the controls have supported citizen judges’ participation but, at the same time, they could be a direct and indirect impediment to the democratic functions of citizen judges...|$|R
