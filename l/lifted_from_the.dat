5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|A bronze {{statue of}} Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925. The {{original}} is {{held at the}} art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, {{in front of the}} Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship Vasa when it was <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the sea in 1961. Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work Löpare (Runners) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide. Boken om Nurmi (The Book about Nurmi), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman. Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939, while Finnair named its first DC-8 Paavo Nurmi in 1969. Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.|$|E

5|$|After Isaac {{crossed the}} Florida Keys on August26, the {{hurricane}} warning was downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning, and the tropical storm watch from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach was discontinued. Simultaneously, the hurricane watch on the Gulf Coast of the United States was upgraded to a hurricane warning along the portion from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Destin, Florida. Additionally, the tropical storm warning was discontinued {{from the mouth of}} the Suwannee River to Tarpon Springs. Early on August27, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was discontinued for areas lying north of the Jupiter Inlet. Six hours later, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter Inlet southward to Ocean Reef, including Lake Okeechobee. At 1500UTC, all of the remaining watches and warnings for South Florida were cancelled. On August28, the tropical storm warning in the Florida Panhandle was discontinued for areas east of Destin. By 1500UTC on August29, all tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings were no longer in effect for the state of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Following Greg's formation, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo, Colima to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, including Islas Marías. The warning was extended to include Lázaro Cárdenas a few hours later. On September6, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for locations south of La Paz {{on the east coast}} of Baja California, while {{a tropical storm}} watch was hoisted for areas south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of Baja California south of Cabo San Lázaro. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of Baja California from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to Loreto. Late on September7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened. The watches and warnings were <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east coast of Baja California early on September8, and they were subsequently lifted for all areas a few hours later.|$|E

5|$|Strasburg {{signed a}} 7-year, $175 million {{extension}} {{to remain with}} the Nationals. With the extension, Strasburg became the first National to receive an opt-out clause in his contract, which allows him to elect free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires. On June 26, 2016, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to an upper back strain. He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter through 6.2 innings until being <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game after throwing 109 pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals still won 12-1. On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 1912 to start 12-0. His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 21. On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.|$|E
5|$|The bones {{found on}} 25 August were {{uncovered}} on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further {{over the next}} two days. The feet were missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent with the body being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a shroud, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, a piece of rusted iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the right hip, suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively. After the exhumation, work continued in the trenches over the following week, before the site was covered with soil to protect it from damage and re-surfaced to restore the car park and playground to their former condition.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00 {{the first}} CH-46 landed at the Embassy. Between 19:00 and 21:00 on 29 April {{approximately}} 130 additional Marines from 2nd Battalion 4th Marines were <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> DAO Compound to reinforce perimeter {{security at the}} Embassy, bringing {{the total number of}} Marines at the Embassy to 175. The evacuation from the DAO Compound was completed by about 19:00 after which all helicopters would be routed to the Embassy; Major Kean was informed that operations would cease at dark. Major Kean advised that the LZ would be well lit and had vehicles moved around the parking lot LZ with their engines running and headlights on to illuminate the LZ. At 21:30 a CH-53 pilot informed Major Kean that Admiral Whitmire, Commander of Task Force 76 had ordered that operations would cease at 23:00. Major Kean saw Ambassador Martin to request that he contact the Oval Office to ensure that the airlift continued. Ambassador Martin soon sent word back to Major Kean that sorties would continue to be flown. At the same time, General Carey met Admiral Whitmire to convince him to resume flights to the Embassy despite pilot fatigue and poor visibility caused by darkness, fires and bad weather.|$|E

5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being <b>lifted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
