50|$|<b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC,</b> {{introduced}} in mid-1978, was licensed from Microsoft and {{was required to}} use the expansion bus and disk drives. It was a cut-down version of the 16 KB Extended BASIC, since the Model I had 12 KB of ROM space. The accompanying manual was more terse and technical than the Level I manual. Original Level I BASIC-equipped machines could be retrofitted to Level II through a ROM replacement performed by Radio Shack for a fee (originally US$199). Users with Level I BASIC programs stored on cassette had to convert these to the tokenized <b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC</b> before use. A utility for this was provided with the Level II ROMS.|$|E

40|$|Holography as {{a subject}} is {{neglected}} largely in current physics lessons and in school books. Even though this topic might be complex, it is applicable and viable {{in the world that}} we live in. Holography lends itself to further develop knowledge with regard to inference optics. However, misconceptions of students impede the learning process. Research conducted by our research group shows that problematic perceptions regarding interference optics still exist with physics students at the intermediate level and on occasion are even sustained by illustrations in school books. Based on this analysis, a concept for a series of lessons is introduced. This series can be taught in physics lessons at the secondary school <b>level</b> <b>II</b> and in <b>basic</b> courses. Initial results from dealing with the subject of holography in an advanced training course will be presented. Comment: 5 papes, 6 figures, in English and Germa...|$|R

50|$|Three {{versions}} of the BASIC programming language were produced for the Model I. Level I BASIC fit in 4 KB of ROM, and <b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC</b> fit into 12 KB of ROM. Level I was single precision only and had a smaller set of commands. Level II introduced double precision floating point support and had a much wider set of commands. Level II was further enhanced when a disk system was added, allowing for the loading of Disk BASIC.|$|E
50|$|Like the Apple II, the {{original}} TRS-80 Model I cannot display lowercase letters. Although the letters exist in its character set, the computer uses seven 2102 SRAMs (1kx1) for the video memory, {{for a total}} of 896 bytes. Since these are 1-bit chips, the eighth bit is missing, meaning the video RAM cannot store values greater than 127. An eighth 2102 chip must be added to enable a full 256 characters. The 1978 manual for the popular word processor Electric Pencil came with instructions for modifying the computer. Although the modification needed to be disabled for <b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC,</b> its design became the industry standard and was widely sold in kit form, along with a character chip with descenders for the lowercase letters. Later models came with the hardware for lowercase character set to be displayed with descenders.|$|E
50|$|The {{source code}} for Altair BASIC {{was thought to}} have been lost to history, but resurfaced in 2000. It had been sitting behind Gates's former tutor and dean Harry Lewis's file cabinet, who rediscovered it. A comment in the source credits Davidoff as the writer of Altair BASIC's math package.Altair BASIC took off and soon most early home {{computers}} ran some form of Microsoft BASIC. The BASIC port for the 6502 CPU, such as used in the Commodore PET, took up more space due to the lower code density of the 6502. Because of this it would likely not fit in a single ROM chip together with the machine-specific input and output code. Since an extra chip was necessary, extra space was available and this was used in part to extend the floating point format from 32 bit to 40 bit. This extended format was not only provided by Commodore BASIC 1 & 2, but was also supported by AppleSoft BASIC I & II since version 1.1 (1977), KIM-1 BASIC since version 1.1a (1977), and MicroTAN BASIC since version 2b (1980). Not long afterwards the Z80 ports, such as <b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC</b> for the TRS-80 (1978), introduced the 64 bit, double precision format as a separate data type from 32 bit, single precision. Microsoft used the same floating point formats in their implementation of Fortran and for their macro assembler MASM, although their spreadsheet Multiplan and their COBOL implementation used binary coded decimal (BCD) floating point. Even so, for a while MBF became the de facto floating point format on home computers, to the point where people still occasionally encounter legacy files and file formats using it.As early as in 1976, Intel was starting the development of a floating point coprocessor. Intel hoped to be able to sell a chip containing good implementations of all the operations found in the widely varying maths software libraries. John Palmer, who managed the project, contacted William Kahan, who suggested that Intel use the floating point of Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) VAX. The first VAX, the VAX-11/780 had just come out in late 1977 and its floating point was highly regarded. However, seeking to market their chip to the broadest possible market, Intel wanted the best floating point possible and Kahan went on to draw up specifications. When rumours of Intel's new chip reached its competitors they started a standardization effort, called IEEE 754, to prevent Intel from gaining too much ground. Kahan got Palmer's permission to participate; he was allowed to explain Intel's design decisions and their underlying reasoning, but not anything related to Intel's implementation architecture. VAX's floating point formats differed from MBF only in that it had the sign in the most significant bit. It turned out that for double precision numbers, an 8 bit exponent isn't wide enough for some wanted operations, e.g. to store the product of two 32-bit numbers.Both Kahan's proposal and a counter-proposal by DEC therefore used 11 bits, like the time-tested 60 bits floating point format of the CDC 6600 from 1965. Kahan's proposal also provided for infinities, which are useful when dealing with division-by-zero conditions, not-a-number values, which are useful when dealing with invalid operations, denormal numbers, which help mitigate problems caused by underflow, and a better balanced exponent bias, which can help avoid overflow and underflow when taking the reciprocal of a number. In 1980 the Intel 8087 chip was already released, but DEC remained opposed, to denormal numbers in particular, because of performance concerns and since it would give DEC a competitive advantage to standardise on DEC's format. The next year DEC had a study done in order to demonstrate that gradual underflow was a bad idea, but the study concluded the opposite and DEC gave in. In 1985 the standard was ratified, but it had already become the de facto standard a year earlier, implemented by many manufacturers.|$|E

The package is comprised of six interactive programs which are generally divided into topical areas. The major emphasis is on exploratory data analysis and statistical inference, however, probability and inverse probability distributions are also included. The programming language is TRS- 80 <b>Level</b> <b>II</b> <b>BASIC</b> enhanced by the input/output commands available through the ESF- 80 (Exatron Stringy Floppy) mass storage subsystem. With the modification of these few commands, the package is compatible with most floppy disk operating systems designed for the TRS- 80 Model I or Model III microcomputers. This statistical analysis capability implemented on a relatively inexpensive system provides a useful tool to the student or the trained analyst without ready access to a mainframe computer system.

30|$|The European Academy of Gynaecological Surgery has recently, in {{conjunction}} with the European Society of Gynaecologic Endoscopy, elaborated a validated programme for training and certification of MIS [20]. This programme includes knowledge and skills training modules. The validated box training modules can easily be incorporated in any skills laboratory. A generally accepted set of criteria potentiates a system of accreditation for laparoscopic skills laboratories. The American College of Surgeons has developed a system for accreditation of skills laboratories regarding general surgical skills in institutes [21]. These criteria are used to determine whether an institute meets the minimum requirements for accreditation as a <b>level</b> <b>II</b> (<b>basic</b> education) or a level I (comprehensive education) institute. In parallel, our set of criteria {{can be used as a}} framework useful in daily practice and possibly for accreditation purposes in the future. More in detail, a skills laboratory can be assessed rating the presence of a criterion with the corresponding median score of our ranked quality criteria list. In that way, criteria that are considered more relevant according to our expert panel receive higher ratings. As a result, an MIS skills laboratory with an MIS skills curriculum can obtain at maximum 62 points (20 points for personnel and resources, 21 points for trainee motivation and 21 points for curriculum). This total score can be used to choose the focus for future developments. Additionally, a practical application might be that a basic MIS laboratory should have at least the indispensible criteria with a median score 3, while a comprehensive MIS laboratory should also have all criteria with a median score of 2 for the certification.|$|E
