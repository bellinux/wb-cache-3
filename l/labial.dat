5|$|The lingual row {{contains}} three cusps and the <b>labial</b> probably five (the {{broken corner}} renders the number uncertain). Transverse ridges, separated by deep valleys, connect the lingual and <b>labial</b> cusps; therefore, the cusps are not strongly separate, but rather fused. The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the <b>labial</b> ones. At {{the front of}} the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two <b>labial</b> cusps. A low crest connects the first lingual to the first <b>labial</b> cusp and a stronger crest, separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley, connects the second lingual to the first <b>labial</b> cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the <b>labial</b> side (the back of the two is broken away, but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern). The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove. The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests, which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more <b>labial</b> cusps, which are missing from the fossil.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (<b>labial)</b> side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another <b>labial</b> root. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the <b>labial</b> and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one <b>labial</b> and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E

5|$|Typically, the <b>labial</b> palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving {{up in front of}} the face. There is great variation in morphology of <b>labial</b> palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and sometimes they are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the <b>labial</b> palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E
5|$|The anteroconid on m1 (the frontmost cusp, {{corresponding}} to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid. There is an ectolophid, an accessory crest in the valley between the protoconid (the cusp on the <b>labial</b> side, behind the anteroconid) and the hypoconid (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back <b>labial</b> corner of the tooth). On {{the other side of}} the tooth, the mesolophid (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an anterolabial cingulum (a shelf on the front <b>labial</b> corner) is present. On m2 and m3, an anterolophid is present—a crest in front of the metaconid (the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth).|$|E

5|$|The best-preserved mf1 is MLP 88-III-28-1. The crown is unworn and {{complete}} {{and there are}} no roots, suggesting that the tooth had not yet erupted when its owner died. Krause, who first described the tooth in 1993, identified it as a right molar, but the subsequent discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica made it clear that Ferugliotherium molariforms had been reversed, and MLP 88-III-28-1 is actually from {{the left side of the}} jaw. The tooth is 2.2mm long and 1.5mm wide. The crown is roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. The lingual row consists of four cusps, which are smaller and lower than the three <b>labial</b> ones. The cusps in this row become smaller and lower from the front to the back. Two ridges descend from the tip of each cusp to the lingual and <b>labial</b> sides. The <b>labial</b> ridges on the first and fourth cusp only reach the base of the cusp, but those on the second and third cusps join ridges descending from the first and second <b>labial</b> cusp. In the first three cusps, the lingual ridge extends to near the lingual margin of the tooth and then turns backward; the end of the ridge is lingual to the next cusp. In the fourth cusp, the ridge hardly extends posteriorly, but rather labially, forming the posterior margin of the tooth and joining a ridge descending from the last <b>labial</b> cusp. The <b>labial</b> cusp row includes three, larger cusps, each of which bears two ridges that descend lingually into the valley between the two cusp rows. The front ridge of each pair ends in the central valley, and the back ridge joins a ridge from a lingual cusp. The ridge pattern results in the presence of three transverse furrows between the main cusps.|$|E
5|$|The holotype, MACN Pv-RN 20, {{is a right}} mf2 {{according}} to both Krause and colleagues (1992) and Gurovich (2005), but Gurovich considered the side that Krause and colleagues thought was lingual to be <b>labial,</b> and vice versa. The latter interpretation {{is used in the}} following description. It is almost square, but at the front it is slightly narrower than at the back. The <b>labial</b> side of the tooth is taller and less worn than the lingual side. There are two rows of cusps, and each lingual cusp is connected to each <b>labial</b> cusp by a broad crest, with one or more fossas in the middle. One of the two <b>labial</b> cusps may have been divided into two smaller cusps. The two crests are separated by a deep furrow. The enamel prisms of this tooth are small, like those of the premolar MACN Pv-RN 250.|$|E
5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the <b>labial</b> (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the <b>labial</b> and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional <b>labial</b> root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} by its enlarged femoral sclaes and its absence of femoral pores; 8-10 lower <b>labials,</b> 10-13 upper <b>labials,</b> 2 internasal scales; 18-22 subdigital lamellaes on its fourth toe of its hindlimb; and about 25-28 scale rows around its midbody.|$|R

50|$|Easily {{recognized}} {{by a set}} of 3-5 horn-like superciliary scales above each eye. The rostral scale is more than twice as broad as high. There are 9 upper <b>labials.</b> The first 3 lower <b>labials</b> on each side are in contact with the one pair of chin shields.|$|R
5|$|The {{single tooth}} of Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as <b>labial,</b> {{in the direction of}} the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction of the tongue). The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back <b>labial</b> corner is missing.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the <b>labial</b> and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the <b>labial</b> cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (<b>labial)</b> side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small <b>labial</b> root.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} has largely {{disappeared}} in bivalves, the mouth has been equipped with <b>labial</b> palps (two {{on each side}} of the mouth) to collect the detritus from its mucus.|$|E

5|$|MACN Pv-RN 975, a {{fragment}} of the mandible (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as Ferugliotherium by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved and worn premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the <b>labial</b> (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the <b>labial</b> side, the four ridges at the back are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel {{and there is no}} small cusp on the <b>labial</b> side. There are two roots; the one at the front is larger than the one at the back and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension at the back. By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.|$|E
5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} <b>labial</b> margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small <b>labial</b> root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the <b>labial</b> rootlet.|$|E
5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the <b>labial,</b> or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and <b>labial</b> margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one <b>labial,</b> one lingual) there is a small additional <b>labial</b> root.|$|E

5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the <b>labial</b> and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the <b>labial</b> and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one <b>labial</b> and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|The m1 is unknown. In m2, {{there are}} two {{well-developed}} transverse crests and one smaller one behind them. The first one consists of two cusps, the anteroconid (<b>labial)</b> and the metaconid (lingual) and the second one joins the protoconid at the <b>labial</b> side with the entoconid at the lingual side. The second crest is weakly joined to the third one, which joins the hypoconid at the <b>labial</b> side to the posteroconid at the back. In one specimen, a cingulum (ridge) is present {{at the back of}} the tooth and a small cusp, the ectostylid, is also present. The m3 becomes narrower towards the back, rendering its form triangular, and contains three crests. The first one again consists of the anteroconid and the metaconid and the second of the protoconid and the entoconid. The third is smaller and consists of the hypoconid with the posteroconid in one specimen, but in the other the posteroconid is reduced to a narrow crest, the posterolophid. Unlike in B.albicauda, the hypoconid remains separate from the posterolophid and is not fused to it. Both m2 and m3 have two roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} upper tooth of Indraloris is an M3, YGSP 46009. It is broken {{at the back}} <b>labial</b> corner. The main cusp is protocone; among the other two cusps, the paracone is higher but the metacone larger. There is a spur {{at the back of}} the protocone, {{suggesting}} a rudimentary hypocone. The protocone is connected to the paracone by a protoloph, which lacks a small cusp (the paraconule). No crest connects the protocone to the metacone, but there is a cingulum at the back margin of the tooth. The tooth bears a strong parastyle (accessory cusp at the front <b>labial</b> corner) and has three roots.|$|E
