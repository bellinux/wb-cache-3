5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track <b>line</b> <b>was</b> built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a line in}} {{the area}} were first {{launched}} 1897, but not until 1914 were the necessary permits granted. The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> built and operated by Ekebergbanen. The line opened in 1917, and connected to the Gamleby Line to reach Stortorvet in the city center. The line differed from the street trams in that it ran in its own right of way and used 1,200 volt supply, unlike the 600 volts used in the streets. In the early 1930s, the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt to double track and a branch, the Simensbråten <b>Line,</b> <b>was</b> built. The Ekeberg <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> extended to its current terminus in 1941. In 1948, the company was taken over by the municipal Oslo Sporveier and operations were integrated in 1965. The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> nearly closed in 1967 and 1973, but during the 1970s, the line received new rolling stock and a renovation. Future plans include an extension to Hauketo Station on the Østfold Line and a new route via Bjørvika to the city center.|$|E

The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} Victorian Railways in 1860 and a <b>line</b> <b>was</b> opened from Geelong to Ballarat in 1862, and later extended south-east from 1876, reaching Warrnambool and Port Fairy in 1890. Branch lines also existed to Queenscliff, Beech Forest, {{and a number of}} other towns.|$|E

The Queens Boulevard <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25,000,000. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike, and the Grand Avenue station opened as part of this extension.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{opened on}} 1 February 1923 as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line, which {{continued}} along Trondheimsveien to Carl Berners plass. The entire Rodeløkka <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt with double track in 1938. In December 1940, a service extension of the Rodeløkka <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> built from Rodeløkka to Søndre Åsen, operated by the Oslo trolleybus, remaining in service until 14 January 1945. The tram service on the Rodeløkka <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> terminated on 6 February 1949, and replaced with bus line 27, although the tracks were kept.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} proposed {{opening of}} the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> on 28 October 1850 by Thomas Farncombe, Lord Mayor of London, but the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> far from complete by this time and so the ceremony was postponed. A second proposed opening date of 1 January 1851 was rejected due to signaling problems.|$|E

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand <b>line</b> <b>was</b> the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} papers on the line's construction, when the line first opened for trains between Sydney and Sutherland construction was not quite complete, so excursion services initially ran on weekends only until the entire <b>line</b> <b>was</b> handed over. The first official train ran within the modern-day suburban area on 9 December 1885, although the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed once again between December 1885 and January 1886 to permit testing on the new bridge over the Georges River.|$|E

5|$|After the take-over, Oslo Sporveier {{immediately}} started expanding the tram network. On 4 May 1924, the Korsvoll <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> opened as {{a branch of}} the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line from Torshov northwestwards to Bjølsen. On 1 August 1925, the Ullevål Hageby <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> extended from Adamstuen further north to Ullevål Hageby. The Kjelsås Line opened on 25 September 1934 and ran from Storo on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line northwards to Kjelsås station. By 1934, the municipality had gained full ownership of Oslo Sporveier. The new company also decided to increase the permitted car width to , allowing wider suburban trams to run in the city streets. During the 1930s, Oslo Sporveier decided it needed more rolling stock, and cooperated with Strømmens Værksted to create the Gullfisk ("Goldfish") class. Forty-six units were delivered from 1937 to 1940. Built with an aluminium chassis, they were quick and light, with a distinct streamlined shape, making their back ends look like a goldfish tail. On 1939, the Sinsen <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> extended from Carl Berners plass northwards to Sinsen. At this point the city had its most extensive tram network.|$|E

5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of its}} line into the town. This <b>line</b> <b>was</b> bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound <b>line</b> <b>was</b> joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The <b>line</b> <b>was</b> built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the <b>line</b> <b>was</b> extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E

The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E
