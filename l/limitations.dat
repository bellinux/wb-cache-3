40|$|Objectives To {{validate}} self-reported preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> {{concept and}} self-report assessment method against muscle power and walking speed, and {{to study the}} predictive validity of preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> with respect to future risk of manifest mobility <b>limitation.</b> Design Observational prospective cohort study and cross-sectional analysis. Setting Research laboratory and community. Participants A total of 632 community-living (age range, 75 - 81 y) women and men {{took part in the}} baseline assessments and 302 persons in the semi-annual interviews on mobility <b>limitation</b> over 2 years. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Walking speed, muscle power, and self-reported preclinical and manifest mobility <b>limitation.</b> Preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> was defined as self-reported tiredness or modification of task performance without task difficulty. At baseline, 4 subgroups were created according to self-reported preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> in any of 3 mobility tasks (walking 2 km, walking 0. 5 km, climbing up stairs) : no <b>limitation,</b> preclinical <b>limitation,</b> and minor and major manifest <b>limitation.</b> Results At baseline, participants with preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> showed intermediate levels of walking speed and muscle power, compared with those with no <b>limitation</b> or manifest mobility <b>limitation.</b> Participants reporting baseline preclinical mobility <b>limitation</b> had 3 - to 6 -fold higher age- and sex-adjusted risk of progressing to major manifest mobility <b>limitation</b> during the 2 -year follow-up compared with participants with no <b>limitation</b> at baseline, whereas the risk among those with minor <b>limitation</b> at baseline was 14 - to 18 -fold higher compared with those with no <b>limitation.</b> Conclusions The self-report assessment tool proved to be a valid measure to capture the early signs of disability and may serve as an inexpensive tool for identifying those nondisabled persons at high risk for future disabilit...|$|R

40|$|There {{are four}} issues when {{the law of}} <b>limitation</b> periods is {{mandatory}}: Firstly, the public interests, which the law of <b>limitation</b> periods can help to protect, cannot {{be the basis of}} the mandatory nature of the law of <b>limitation</b> periods, because these interests are relatively weaker than other interests protected by law. Secondly, the mandatory nature of the law of <b>limitation</b> periods shapes it as an unchangeable norm group, which is in contradiction with some specific rules of the law of <b>limitation</b> periods. Thirdly, according to legal practices, the contractual agreement about <b>limitation</b> periods cannot easily jeopardize the public interests protected by the law of <b>limitation</b> periods. On the contrary, the mandatory nature of <b>limitation</b> periods will not only frustrate the reasonable expectations of the parties, but also induce bad faith behaviors, and trigger the trust crisis of the society. Lastly, the legislations in comparative law cannot be used as evidence for Section 2 of “Provisions of the Law of <b>Limitation</b> Periods”.

In the context that the law of <b>limitation</b> periods should be dispositive, some boundaries can be set to meet special needs of the parties under special circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: The {{aim of the}} ALICE (Airflow <b>Limitation</b> in Cardiac Diseases in Europe) {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the prevalence of airflow <b>limitation</b> in patients with ischemic heart disease and the effects on quality of life, healthcare use, and future health risk. Objectives: To examine prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry in outpatients aged {{greater than or equal to}} 40 years with clinically documented ischemic heart disease who were current or former smokers. Methods: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 cardiovascular outpatient clinics in nine European countries. Airflow <b>limitation</b> was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC less than 0. 70. Measurements and Main Results: Among the 3, 103 patients with ischemic heart disease who were recruited, lung function was defined for 2, 730 patients. Airflow <b>limitation</b> was observed in 30. 5 % of patients with ischemic heart disease: 11. 3 % had mild airflow <b>limitation,</b> 15. 8 % moderate airflow <b>limitation,</b> 3. 3 % severe airflow <b>limitation,</b> and 0. 1 % very severe airflow <b>limitation.</b> Most patients with airflow <b>limitation</b> (70. 6 %) had no previous spirometry testing or diagnosed pulmonary disease. Airflow <b>limitation</b> was associated with greater respiratory symptomatology, impaired health status, and more frequent emergency room visits (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Airflow <b>limitation</b> compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects almost one-third of patients with ischemic heart disease.

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of <b>limitations</b> (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of <b>limitations</b> was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action.

40|$|Biodiesel from microalgae is a {{promising}} technology. Nutrient <b>limitation</b> {{and the addition}} of CO 2 are two strategies to increase lipid content in microalgae. There are two different types of nitrogen <b>limitation,</b> progressive and abrupt <b>limitation.</b> In this work, the simultaneous effect of initial nitrate concentration, addition of CO 2, and nitrogen <b>limitation</b> on biomass, lipid, protein and carbohydrates accumulation were analyzed. An experimental design was established in which initial nitrogen concentration, culture time and CO 2 aeration as independent numerical variables with three levels were considered. Nitrogen <b>limitation</b> was taken into account as a categorical independent variable. For the experimental design, all the experiments were performed with progressive nitrogen <b>limitation.</b> The dependent response variables were biomass, lipid production, carbohydrates and proteins. Subsequently, comparison of both types of <b>limitation</b> i. e. progressive and abrupt <b>limitation,</b> was performed. Nitrogen <b>limitation</b> in a progressive mode exerted a greater effect on lipid accumulation. Culture time, nitrogen <b>limitation</b> and the interaction of initial nitrate concentration with nitrogen <b>limitation</b> had higher influences on lipids and biomass production. The highest lipid production and productivity were at 582 mgL- 1 (49. 7 % lipid, dry weight basis) and 41. 5 mgL- 1 d- 1, respectively; under the following conditions: 250 mgL- 1 of initial nitrate concentration, CO 2 supply of 4 % (v/v), 12 d of culturing and 2 d in state of nitrogen starvation induced by progressive <b>limitation.</b> This work presents a novel way to perform simultaneous analysis of the effect of the initial concentration of nitrate, nitrogen <b>limitation,</b> and CO 2 supply on growth and lipid production of Nannochloropsis oculata, with the aim to produce potential biofuels feedstock...|$|R

40|$|In {{large areas}} of the ocean {{phytoplankton}} growth is limited by the scarcity of iron (Fe), an essential co-factor for multiple enzymes. Phytoplankton has hence developed strategies to survive under Fe <b>limitation.</b> Here, we characterize the response to Fe <b>limitation</b> of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 acclimated to different Fe concentrations in chemically characterized synthetic seawater. The inorganic Fe concentrations used represent levels of Fe <b>limitation</b> relevant for different domains of the contemporary ocean. Combining physiological and transcriptomic approaches, we provide evidence of the progression of the physiological responses to increasing levels of Fe <b>limitation.</b> Our results showed a rising number of significantly regulated genes and the complexity of the response to increasing Fe <b>limitation.</b> Mild Fe <b>limitation</b> induced up-regulation of genes involved in Fe uptake, while genes involved in photosynthesis and respiration were down-regulated. Strong Fe <b>limitation</b> induced up-regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism and concomitant down-regulation of macronutrients uptake. Severe Fe <b>limitation</b> affected fine metabolic regulation of co-factors expression and activation of anti-oxidative stress responses. Our results suggest that homeostasis under long-term Fe <b>limitation</b> put at play dramatically different mechanisms for oxidative stress mitigation and carbon metabolism than those previously reported under Fe stress. Hence, evidence the importance of acclimation processes on the performance of cyanobacteria under Fe <b>limitation</b> conditions...|$|R
