40|$|The TAB {{technology}} {{enables the}} interconnection of IC components with high pin counts and small pitches to printed circuit boards. In {{the scope of}} this project the outer <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> (OLB) process was performed by hotbar soldering and investigated, optimized and characterized for different pitches. The requirements for an automated hotbar soldering system for outer <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> in a mass production process were determined. A placement accuracy of _-"+ 3 #sigma#=_-"+ 5 #mu#m is necessary for achieving high process quality (_-"+ 6 #sigma#). TAB-components with gold plated leads and a pitch of 0. 3 mm were used in a multichip module. The hotbar soldering process was investigated and optimized. TAB test components with tin plated leads were designed for an outer lead pitch of 0. 15 mm. The outer <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> process was performed and investigated using a fully automated hotbar soldering system. The attained know-how for applying and processing very-fine pitch TAB components is contained in the recommendations and guidelines and can readily be shared by anyone new to the technologies investigated here.

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{pressure}} welding (HPW) {{is one of}} the inner <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> process which is widely used in microelectronics manufacturing. This paper presents a practical digital temperature controller for HPW. Based on the step response, an identification method is developed to obtain a nonlinear time-delay model for heating-up control design. The input-output linearization problem is solved by means of second-order Pade approximation and static inverse transform, and an optimal controller is obtained for the welding machine. The experimental equipment on the temperature control is designed based on LabVIEW and data acquisition card. Simulation and experimental results show that the dynamic performance, steady stage error and overshoot satisfy the designed requirements...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In the {{production}} of logic circuits in dual inline packages, various tedious assembly line tasks are performed by human operators using microscopes or television enlargements. One boring and difficult task is the detection of bent fingers in <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> frames to which integrated circuit chips are subsequently bonded. Bent fingers can cause stresses which may eventually lead {{to the failure of}} circuits. This. paper discusses the inspection problem and presents a computerized bent finger detection method which could be adapted to free human operators from this task.

40|$|AbstractUsing a {{flip chip}} {{configuration}} to interconnect a die with its substrate gives the device a smaller footprint (very desirable in multi-chip modules) and avoids the register and planarity problems one would face with <b>lead</b> <b>bonding,</b> such as TAB interconnects. The drawback is that flip chips have {{very small and}} very critical internal bonds which must be inspected to ensure {{the reliability of the}} device. Visual inspection methods, which are the most widely used methods for the inspection of interconnect quality, are not adequate for the evaluation of flip chip attach. The solder joints are located below the die and the bonds are often located throughout the face of the chip, not just at the perimeter of the die. This renders them uinspectable by visual techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Neuroscience and neuroprosthetic {{devices are}} in-creasingly {{in need of}} more compact less {{invasive}} 3 -D electrode arrays for interfacing with neural tissue. To meet these needs, a folding 64 -site 3 -D array architecture has been developed. The microstructure, in which four probes and two platforms are fabri-cated as a single planar unit, results in a low-profile (< 350 -μm) narrow-platform (0. 604 -mm 2 silicon footprint) implant for corti-cal use. Signals are routed from 177 -μm 2 iridium sites through polysilicon lines to the probe back end and then across 4 -μm-thick parylene-encased electroplated-gold folding lead transfers to the associated platform. Three levels of interconnect with a 10 -μm minimum pitch are utilized for the 32 leads that traverse the platforms. After rapid microassembly, micromachined latches are used to fasten the folded device. Two flexible parylene cables with gold leads at a 20 -μm pitch are monolithically integrated with the probes to minimize tethering and avoid any need for <b>lead</b> <b>bonding</b> within the array, and these cables carry the neural signals to a remote circuit module or percutaneous connector. With thin (∼ 15 -μm) boron-doped shanks at a ∼ 200 -μm pitch, the array displaces only 1. 7 % of the 0. 64 -mm 2 instrumented tissue area, assuming a 100 -μm recording range. Neural signals were recorded in vivo from the guinea pig auditory cortex.

40|$|The Boeing Company has {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) and Surface Mount Technology (SMT) for a highly reliable, low cost interconnect for concentrator solar cell arrays. TAB and SMT are currently used in the electronics industry for chip interconnects and printed circuit board assembly. TAB tape consists of sixty-four 3 -mil/ 1 -oz tin-plated copper leads on 8 -mil centers. The leads are thermocompression gang bonded to GaAs concentrator solar cell with silver contacts. This bond, known as an Inner <b>Lead</b> <b>Bond</b> (ILB), allows for pretesting and sorting capability via nondestruct wire bond pull and flash testing. Destructive wire pull tests resulted in preferred mid-span failures. Improvements in fill factor were attributed to decreased contact resistance on TAB bonded cells. Preliminary thermal cycling and aging tests were shown excellent bond strength and metallurgical results. Auger scans of bond sites reveals an Ag-Cu-Tin composition. Improper bonds are identified through flash testing as a performance degradation. On going testing of cells are underway at Lewis Research Center. SMT techniques are utilized to excise and form TAB leads post ILB. The formed leads' shape isolates thermal mismatches between the cells and the flex circuit they are mounted on. TABed cells are picked and placed with a gantry x-y-z positioning system with pattern recognition. Adhesives are selected to avoid thermal expansion mismatch and promote thermal transfer to the flex circuit.
