The claim must be confirmed by a court order and duly registered, an expensive process. The user must prove [...] "enjoyment without force, without secrecy and without the oral or written consent of the … owner", a restatement of the centuries-old principle of Nec vi, nec clam, nec precario.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the High Council pursues {{a policy}} of stylistic simplicity, as decreed by Interior Ministry {{guidelines}} from 1977. Most <b>modern</b> <b>grants</b> occur {{as a result of}} administrative reforms, with municipalities merging into larger ones. Usually, a civic body submits a proposal to the High Council which adapts it to meet heraldic standards. Regional historical or genealogical societies are known to have been involved drawing up these initial designs. Newly formed municipalities tend to press for inclusion of elements of the old arms of the constituting municipalities into the new arms, with the High Council sometimes rejecting proposals {{on the grounds that they}} are ‘overcharged’.|$|R

50|$|Bragadin {{worked hard}} to fortify Famagusta thoroughly; the {{introduction}} of gunpowder meant that scientifically-planned fortifications with solid walls were needed.

50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} {{is relatively}} <b>modern,</b> <b>granted</b> on 14 November 1898. The arms show a silver eagle holding a gold anchor in its left claw {{and a gold}} Rod of Asclepius in its right claw all on a red background. The eagle in the arms {{is derived from the}} arms of the merchant Johan Heinrich Tordenskiold, who, in 1819, donated all his fortune to build a school in Holmestrand. The eagle also gave its name to the main ship of the merchant, which is shown on the breast-shield, the White Eagle. The anchor symbolises the importance of Holmestrand as a harbour town. The snake on the Rod of Asclepius is the symbol of medicine and symbolises the former health spa in Holmestrand that existed in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
