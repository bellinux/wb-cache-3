Department of Energy Consent Order No. DE 91 NM- 177 (Consent Order) lists {{regulatory}} milestones for {{liquid effluent}} streams at the Hanford Site {{to comply with}} the permitting requirements of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 216 (`State Waste Discharge Permit Program`) or WAC 173 - 218 (`Washington Underground Injection Control Program`) where applicable. Hanford Site <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>streams</b> <b>discharging</b> to the soil column are categorized as Phase I and Phase II Streams, and Miscellaneous Streams. There were originally 33 Phase I and Phase II Streams, however some of these streams have been eliminated. Miscellaneous Streams are those <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>streams</b> <b>discharged</b> to the ground that are not categorized as Phase I or Phase II Streams, and are subject to the requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order. The three criteria for identifying streams that are potentially affecting groundwater are: (1) <b>streams</b> <b>discharging</b> to surface contaminated areas (referred to as category `b` streams); (2) potentially contaminated streams (referred to as category `c` streams); and (3) <b>streams</b> <b>discharging</b> within 91 meters (300 feet) of a contaminated crib, ditch, or trench (referred to as category `d` streams). Miscellaneous Streams that meet any of these criteria must be evaluated for application of best management practices (BMP). The purpose of this report is to provide the best management practice preferred alternative. The list of BMP streams has been revised since the original submittal. Several streams from the original list of BMP streams have already been eliminated through facility upgrades, reduction of steam usage, and facility shutdowns. This document contains a description of the changes to the list of BMP streams, applicable definitions and regulatory requirements and possible alternatives, and a schedule for implementing the preferred alternatives...|$|R

40|$|A typical {{drying process}} that has <b>liquid</b> and gas <b>discharge</b> <b>streams</b> has been {{analysed}} {{and the impact of}} selecting various combinations of soft temperatures on heat recovery, utility targets, area targets, capital cost and total cost is reported. The method is based on the plus-minus principle and traditional pinch analysis methods for utility, area and capital cost targeting with the modification of using a ΔT contribution. Results show that there is significant benefit from optimising discharge temperatures for total cost. To achieve minimum energy consumption and total cost, heat recovery from the dryer exhaust air is necessary. Heat recovery from liquid heat sources is shown to be preferable over gas streams due to a higher film coefficient resulting in less heat exchanger area and capital cost. There is also value in making process modifications, such as combining streams or removing small streams to be solely heated by utility, {{to reduce the number of}} network heat exchangers. For the best case, the discharge temperatures of the leaving streams are 18. 0 °C for water condensate (liquid stream) and 52. 4 °C for the exhaust air (gas stream) ...|$|R

Hanford Site <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>streams</b> <b>discharging</b> to the soil column are categorized in the Consent Order as follows: Phase I Streams; Phase II Streams; and Miscellaneous Streams. Phase I and Phase II Streams are addressed in two reports: Plan and Schedule to Discontinue Disposal of Contaminated Liquids into the Soil Column at the Hanford Site (DOE-RL 1987), and Annual Status of the Report of the Plan and schedule to Discontinue Disposal of Contaminated Liquids into the Soil Column at the Hanford Site (WHC-EP- 0196 - 1). There originally were 33 Phase I and Phase II Streams; however, some streams have been eliminated. Miscellaneous streams are those <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>streams</b> <b>discharged</b> to the ground that arc not categorized as Phase I or Phase II Streams. Source waters of miscellaneous streams originate directly from the Columbia River, from treated Columbia River water, or from groundwater and demineralized water. Miscellaneous streams result primarily from source water used in processes such as cooling, hydrotesting, and steam generation. Miscellaneous streams also occur through the use of these source waters for maintenance and construction activities such as draining, flushing, and washing. Miscellaneous <b>streams</b> <b>discharging</b> to the soil column on the Hanford Site were subject to the requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order (DE 91 NM- 177). The Plan and Schedule for Disposition and Regulatory Compliance for Miscellaneous Streams (DOE/RL- 93 - 94) provides for the disposition of miscellaneous streams to satisfy one of the Consent Order Section 6 requirements. Additional commitments established in the plan and schedule (Activity 6. 2. 3, 6. 2. 4, and 6. 2. 6) were to submit WAC 173 - 216 Categorical State Waste Discharge Permit applications for hydrotest, maintenance, and Construction waste water, cooling water and condensate, and storm water discharges.

40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{hydrogen}} no-vent fill tests were performed {{in this test}} series using various size spray nozzles and a spray bar with different hole sizes in a 5 cubic foot receiver tank. Fill levels of 90 percent by volume or greater were achieved in 26 of the tests while maintaining a receiver tank pressure below 30 psia. Spray nozzles were mounted {{at the top of}} the tank, whereas, the spray bar was centered in the tank axially. The spray nozzle no-vent fills demonstrated tank pressure and temperature responses comparable to previous test series. Receiver tank pressure responses for the spray bar configuration were similar to the spray nozzle tests with the pressure initially rising rapidly, then leveling off as vapor condenses onto the <b>discharging</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>streams,</b> and finally ramping up near the end of the test due to ullage compression. Both liquid injection techniques tested were capable of filling the receiver tank to 90 percent under variable test conditions. Comparisons between the spray nozzle and spray bar configurations for well matched test conditions indicate the spray nozzle injection technique is more effective in minimizing the receiving tank pressure throughout a no-vent fill compared to the spray bar under normal gravity conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to develop a {{sustainable}} zero <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination system. Direct contact membrane distillation unit is connected directly to salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) to achieve zero <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination. The used system contains a hydrophobic microporous membrane module and a plastic pipe circulating all over the pond water surface to be used as a cooling system. The pipe also used as a wave suppression system as it is floating over the top of the pond water surface. The system is sourced by the hot and high concentrated saline water that is extracted from non convective zone as a feed solution, then, the brine discharges at the lower convective zone of the solar pond. Therefore, if the saturated brine is used to produce salts, there will not be any brine left over which may lead to zero <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination. The system is modelled theoretically and solved by Matlab simulation program. It has been found that the system has the ability to deliver 52 I/day of fresh water for m(2) of membrane coupled with SGSP, consuming almost 11 kWim(2) of thermal energy. Also, the trans membrane coefficient of the used membrane is proved to be 0. 001 kg/m(2) /Pa/h. The results are analysed and the system performance is evaluated and presented in this paper...|$|R
