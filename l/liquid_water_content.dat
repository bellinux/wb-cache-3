The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them.

Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research.

40|$|A microwave-based, profile-type {{precipitation}} retrieval algorithm {{has been}} used to analyze high-resolution passsive microwave measurements over an ocean background, obtained by the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) flown on a NASA ER- 2 aircraft. The analysis is designed to first determine the improvements that can be gained by adding brightness temperature information from the AMPR low-frequency channel (10. 7 GHz) to a multispectral retrieval algorithm nominally run with satellite information at 19, 37, and 85 GHz. The impact of spatial resolution degradation of the high-resolution brightness temperature information on the retrieved rain/cloud <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> and ice <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> is then quantified in order to assess the possible biases inherent to satellite-based retrieval. Careful inspection of the high-resolution aircraft dataset reveals five distinctive brightness temperature features associated with cloud structure and scattering effects that are not generally detectable in current passive microwave satellite measurements. Results suggest that the inclusion of 10. 7 -GHz information overcomes two basic problems associated with three-channel retrieval. Intercomparisons of retrievals carried out at high-resolution and then averaged to a characteristic satellite scale to the corresponding retrievals in which the brightness temperatures are first convolved down to the satellite scale suggest that with the addition of the 10. 7 -GHz channel, the rain <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> will not be negatively impacted by special resolution degradation.

40|$|The microphysical {{processes}} {{associated with}} the growth of clond and precipitation particles during two stable orographic storms are identi-fied in this thesis. A two dimensional steady-state model of airflow over an ideal mountain barrier is developed and used to define the loca-tion and rate of production of condensate available for liqaid water and ice particle growth in these two storms. A crystal trajectory model is also developed to determine origin levels and upwind location of cry-stals which impact on the mountain barrier. The major conclusions in this thesis concerning stably stratified storms in the northern Rockies are the following: a. The majority of clond <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> in stably stratified oro-graphic storms exists in a narrow zone over the windward slopes of the primary barrier.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of determining snow water equivalent (SWE) {{by the use}} of an acoustic impulse was assessed at two field locations in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, Canada. These sites represent cold windswept prairie and temperate deep mountain snowcovers. A continuous frequency-swept acoustic wave was sent into the snowpack and received. Signal processing was then subsequently used to estimate the depth and density of each snow layer by a recursive relationship involving frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and seismological techniques. From this method, it is also shown that the tortuosity of snow can be estimated. Data collected by gravimetric sampling was used as comparison to the SWE values determined {{by the use of}} acoustic sounding. The results showed that for the Saskatchewan sites, the correlation between the measured and the modeled values of SWE was 0 Ð 86, whereas at the British Columbia sites, the correlation was 0 Ð 78.
