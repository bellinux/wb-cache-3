50|$|The bid-offer spread is an {{accepted}} measure of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in exchange traded securities and commodities. On any standardized exchange, two elements comprise {{almost all of}} the transaction cost—brokerage fees and bid-offer spreads. Under competitive conditions, the bid-offer spread measures the cost of making transactions without delay. The difference in price paid by an urgent buyer and received by an urgent seller is the liquidity cost. Since brokerage commissions do not vary with the time taken to complete a transaction, differences in bid-offer spread indicate differences in the liquidity cost.|$|E

40|$|Following the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis, and {{in common with}} many stock markets around the world, the Amman Securities Exchange (ASE) experienced some heavy losses. However, what makes the Jordanian market probably different is its inability to recover. The weighted price index fell from 7519. 3 points in 2007 to 5520. 1 points in 2009, to 4593. 9 points in 2012, and to 4336. 7 points {{by the end of}} 2013 respectively.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} a perpetual prepayment option related to a corporate loan. The default intensity of the firm is supposed to follow a CIR process. We assume that the contractual margin of the loan {{is defined by the}} credit quality of the borrower and the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> that reflects the funding cost of the bank. Two frameworks are discussed: firstly a loan margin without <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> and secondly a multiregime framework with a <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> dependent on the regime. The prepayment option needs specific attention as the payoff itself is an implicit function of the parameters of the problem and of the dynamics. In the unique regime case, we establish quasianalytic formulas for the payoff of the option; in both cases we give a verification result that allows for the computation of the price of the option. Numerical results that implement the findings are also presented and are completely consistent with the theory; it is seen that when liquidity parameters are very different (i. e., when a liquidity crisis occurs) in the high <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> regime, the exercise domain may entirely disappear, meaning that it is not optimal for the borrower to prepay during such a liquidity crisis.

40|$|The major {{finding is}} that <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in futures options market are {{two to three times}} higher than <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in the futures market. Liquidity cost is one {{potential}} factor to consider when choosing between hedging with a futures contract or with an option contract. While there is considerable research that estimates <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> of futures trading, there is little comparable research about options markets. This study, for the first time, attempts to determine and compare <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in options and futures markets. The study uses July 2007 wheat futures and options contracts traded on Kansas City Board of Trade. Two measures of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> were used for both options and futures markets. One measure of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in options markets is the average bid-ask spread that is calculated from the available bidask quotes. A new measure of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in options markets is derived based on the Black model and it uses trade prices instead of observed bid-ask quotes. The <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in the options market was estimated to be 1. 60 cents per bushel using observed bid-ask spreads and it was 1. 37 cents per bushel when the new measure was used. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in the futures markets are estimated using Roll’s measure and average absolute price changes. The estimates were 0. 45 and 0. 49 cents per bushel, respectively for futures contracts. A positive relation was found between option <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and moneyness of the option.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the portfolio implications of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and uncertainty regarding liquidation costs. In many cases, financial securities such as equities trade in active markets in which equity owners can liquidate their holdings quickly and with little price concession. In contrast, real assets, such as commercial property, {{may take a}} substantial amount of time to sell and entail significant transactions costs (the recent experience during the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis indicates that some markets may fail to operate effectively, making estimates of <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> extremely uncertain). For this we focus on literature that considers the impact of uncertainty (as opposed to risk) on portfolio choice (Garlappi, Uppal, and Wang, RFS 2007), and extend this to include a measure of liquidity and liquidity risk of asset prices. In particular, our paper examines the optimal relative weight of real estate in a portfolio when both <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> and the uncertainty regarding <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are considered.

40|$|We build a {{model of}} {{short-term}} interbank loans. The variation across different banks in their cost from handling an excess or a deficit of liquidity (‘liquidity cost’) drives the variation in interest rates. We characterize {{the shape of the}} interest rate curve as a function of loan size and find that a small bank that trades with a large bank tends to get better interest rates for larger loans. The model is consistent with the following observations on the Mexican interbank market, obtained from a unique dataset of interbank loan transactions: (i) the variation in the interest rates on the loans between two large banks is small; (ii) small banks lending to (borrowing from) large banks receive lower (pay higher) interest rates than large banks lending to (borrowing from) other large banks; and (iii) a small bank trading with a large bank gets more favorable interest rates for larger loans. Finally, as an application of the model, we discuss how banking environment changes during a financial crisis. In particular, we estimate the shape of the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> function and use that information to measure the shift in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost</b> that banks faced during the 2008 financial crisis. We find that the increased disadvantage that small banks experienced in the interbank market during the crisis can largely be explained by a shift in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>cost,</b> rather than by changes in loan supply and demand. ∗E-mail...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to analyze <b>liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> in {{agricultural}} futures markets based on the observed bid-ask spread (BAS) faced by market participants. The results reveal a highly liquid corn market that mostly offers order execution at minimum cost. The BAS responds negatively to volume and positively to price volatility, but also affects volume traded and price volatility. While statistically significant, these responses on a cents/bushel or a percentage basis are generally small. <b>Liquidity</b> <b>costs</b> are also virtually impervious to short-term changes in demand for spreading and trend-following trader activity, as well as differences from day-of-the-week changes in market activity.

Concerning liquidity, we are unable to draw any definite conclusions related to change. This is due to the weak robustness of our tests, which will make any conclusion drawn unreliable.
