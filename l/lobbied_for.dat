40|$|In this thesis, I take a within-industry view {{on special}} {{interest}} groups and study the impact of corporate <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> subsidies. My thesis {{is a collection of}} three single-authored research papers, studying both theoretically and empirically different facets of the firm-level links between lobbying and subsidies. Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 are theoretical contributions analyzing <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> subsidies in a heterogeneous firms framework. In particular, I study <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> a production subsidy in a closed economy (Chapter 2) and <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> export subsidies in an open economy (Chapter 4). Chapter 3 is an empirical study in which I analyze the link between lobbying and subsidies at the US firm level...|$|R

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given.

When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else.

5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and <b>lobbied</b> <b>for</b> more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary.

As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully <b>lobbied</b> <b>for</b> laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access.

The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon.

The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, <b>lobbied</b> <b>for</b> national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{had known}} that ruling against the {{government}} might harm his prospects of promotion. By {{the time of the}} case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he <b>lobbied</b> <b>for</b> promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Kentuckians {{ratified}} {{their third}} constitution. One of many changes effected by this document {{was that the}} office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged to the Democrats, Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks {{and use of the}} Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition of tuition charges and unsuccessfully <b>lobbied</b> <b>for</b> a pay increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853.|$|E

McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E
