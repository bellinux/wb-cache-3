5|$|Maryland had {{previously}} shown {{an ability to}} strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18out of 28touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> of game time. This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession. In the Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1:01 with a 59-yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon. Maryland also possessed the ball for 2:26 less than Nevada.|$|E

50|$|Current {{evidence}} supports an average intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) of {{six and a}} half minutes in 18- to 30-year-olds. If the disorder is defined as an IELT percentile below 2.5, then premature ejaculation could be suggested by an IELT of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> about <b>two</b> <b>minutes.</b> Nevertheless, it is possible that men with abnormally low IELTs could be satisfied with their performance and do not report a lack of control. Likewise, those with higher IELTs may consider themselves premature ejaculators, suffer from detrimental side effects normally associated with premature ejaculation, and even benefit from treatment.|$|R
30|$|Both the 1 PL and 2 PL {{models can}} be {{implemented}} practically with the MHRM algorithm, though flexMIRT is new and not yet highly accessible to many researchers focusing on the school settings. Only a handful of quadrature points {{could be used for}} EM estimation (a maximum of 13 on a computing platform with 8 GB of memory using 8 threads). Even then, convergence required about two hours whereas the same problem required <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2 <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> with the MHRM algorithm. Thus, lack of familiarity with new estimation software will clearly be overcome by practical utility.|$|R
5|$|Pittsburgh {{faced the}} Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final, after Carolina {{defeated}} the Boston Bruins and New Jersey Devils. The series opened in Pittsburgh, where Miroslav Satan and Philippe Boucher scored their first {{goals of the}} playoffs. Marc-Andre Fleury was named the game's third star after making 23saves and helping the Penguins to a 3–2 victory. In Game 2, Malkin scored a hat-trick and Chris Kunitz scored his first goal of the playoffs as the Penguins won 7–4, taking a two games to none series lead. In Game 3, Malkin scored two goals and Crosby scored one as the Penguins took a 3–1 lead into the first intermission. After a scoreless second period, the Hurricanes came within a goal after Sergei Samsonov scored <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> into the final period, but goals by Fedotenko, Craig Adams and Guerin gave the Penguins a 6–2 victory. The series concluded with the Penguins sweeping, four games to none. In the series' fourth game, Pittsburgh gave up the initial goal <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> into the opening period, but goals from Fedotenko and Talbot gave them the lead after the first period. A second period goal from Guerin and an empty netter from Adams sealed the Penguins' victory {{in the game and}} the series.|$|E

His final college game was the 1944 Orange Bowl against Texas A, {{in which he was}} responsible for all of his team's points as he ran for two touchdowns, threw for one more, and kicked LSU's only successful extra point attempt in the 19–14 victory. He finished the season with 847 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns. He also completed 13 of 36 passing attempts for 160 yards. His 98 points scored (111 including the bowl game) led the nation. After the season, the Associated Press named Van Buren to its All-Southeastern Conference first team.|$|E

The Ravens defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-17. The following week, against the Atlanta Falcons, Smith would score the game-sealing touchdown. With <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> {{left in the game}} and facing a fourth down, Flacco threw a pass to Smith, and he caught it in for a 39-yard score. Smith would finish the game with three receptions, 81 yards and the 39 yard touchdown, as the Ravens won of 29-7.|$|E
40|$|Upstream waves {{have been}} {{postulated}} to {{be a major}} source of energy for the dayside magnetic pulsations within the magnetosphere. Thus, it is of interest to determine over what frequency range in the ion foreshock the power of fluctuations in the solar wind is enhanced. The magnetic field data from pairs of spacecraft, when they stay {{on either side of the}} ion foreshock boundary, were examined. It was found that the power of magnetic fluctuations is enhanced only at periods <b>less</b> <b>than</b> about <b>two</b> <b>minutes,</b> not at longer periods. Thus the upstream waves may contribute to Pc 3 and Pc 4 pulsations in the dayside magnetosphere, but they cannot be directly responsible for the longer-period waves...|$|R
50|$|The {{phase shift}} also caused {{problems}} for IID's and WALC's systems. In <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one <b>minute,</b> <b>two</b> of IID's transformers had overloaded and disconnected. This caused severe low voltage on WALC's system. Several minutes later, a third transformer tripped off, causing {{the bulk of}} IID's system to be disconnected from SCE to the north.

5000|$|The film also {{featured}} the new 2003 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, first seen when Lara parachutes into the moving vehicle in Africa and {{takes over the}} wheel from Kosa. As part of Jeep's advertising campaign, it was specially customised for the film by Jeep's design team along with the film's production designers, with three copies constructed for filming. 1,001 limited-run Tomb Raider models were produced—available only in silver like the film version and minus its special customisations—and put on the market {{to coincide with the}} release of the film. Jeep vice president Jeff Bell explained, [...] "ad campaign {{is more than just a}} product placement ... the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon is the most capable Jeep ever built, so the heroic and extreme environment in which Lara Croft uses her custom Wrangler Rubicon in Tomb Raider is accurate." [...] In the end, Lara's Rubicon had <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> total <b>minutes</b> of screen time in the finished film.|$|R
5|$|She led the Golden Bears {{in scoring}} {{during her first}} season with the team.

Despite continued absences due to U.S. national team commitments throughout her collegiate career, Morgan led the Golden Bears in scoring and helped the team reach the NCAA Tournament four years in a row, advancing to the second round twice.|$|E
5|$|The 1978–79 season capped Montreal's run of four {{consecutive}} championships in dramatic fashion. Facing the Bruins {{in the seventh}} game of the league semi-finals, Montreal trailed 4–3 with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> to play when Boston head coach Don Cherry accidentally sent too many players onto the ice during a line change, drawing what {{would become one of}} the most famous penalties in NHL history, and eventually costing Cherry his job. During the subsequent power play, Lafleur scored the game-tying goal with 74 seconds remaining in regulation time, and Yvon Lambert scored in overtime to win the game and series. The Canadiens proceeded to defeat the Rangers for the Cup in five games.|$|E
5|$|Ball State {{jumped out}} to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> to play to retake the lead. Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
50|$|At 2:06 p.m., the Big Eddy-Ostrander line flashed and {{grounded}} to a tree. At 2:52 p.m., the John Day-Marion line (also {{owned by}} BPA) flashed to a tree; {{due to a}} circuit breaker being out of service, this also took the Marion-Lane line out of operation. At 3:42 p.m., the Keeler-Allston line arced and grounded to a tree near Hillsboro, Oregon, just southwest of Portland. It was the fourth power line in Oregon to fail in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> hours. Five <b>minutes</b> later, at 3:47 p.m., the 230 kV Ross-Lexington line (also owned by Bonneville Power Administration) flashed and grounded to a tree near Vancouver, Washington, across the Columbia River from the Portland/Hillsboro area. This started a small fire. One minute later, at 3:48 p.m., the 13 turbines at McNary Dam, on the Columbia about 190 miles upstream from Portland, tripped off line.|$|R
5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star {{of at least three}} solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one <b>minute.</b> <b>Two</b> nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service {{in the last year}} of World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 to return to the project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> of screen time.

5|$|The Horns took {{possession}} of the ball to start the game and used <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> in scoring on a 25-yard carry by Jamaal Charles. Rice advanced to the Texas43-yard line before punting the ball to Texas' one-yard line, forcing the Longhorns to start from inside their own end zone. UT drove the ball 99yards in sevenplays for a secondtouchdown. With fourseconds {{left in the first}} quarter, Vince Young threw a pass that was intercepted by Ja'Corey Shepherd at the UT20-yard line. Rice lost yardage on their possession and failed to convert on fourth down so they turned the ball over on downs. The rest of the first-half scoring was dominated by the Longhorns as they scored four more touchdowns to take a 42–0 lead. The Owls had four–more possessions in the second–quarter but never advanced the ball past their own 30-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The breakaway's {{lead was}} reduced to <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> {{at the foot of}} the first climb. Howes {{attacked}} alone, with Madrazo following. On the descent, however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which had caught the remainder of the breakaway. On the flat section that followed the climb, several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on the climb, but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After the descent, the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.|$|E

Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter, California and quarterback Aaron Rodgers scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42–28 lead into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, the Hokies clawed back into competition. Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter, but Cal answered with one of its own, making the score 49–35. The Hokies evened the score at 49–49 after an 80-yard touchdown drive that took <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> and a punt return by DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown.

Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in {{overtime}}, the Canadiens won ten overtime games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most consecutive overtime victories in a playoff year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The defining moment of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal curve, and assessed a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in overtime 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in overtime before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E
