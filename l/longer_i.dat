25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and I {{needed to get}} a new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E

[...] Sesame Workshop also released a statement: [...] "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has {{resigned from}} 'Sesame Street.'" [...] They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show.|$|E

500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I am sorry to be leaving the dear old Munster lads, but I really can't stand it any <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E

Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

500|$|Both the King and Queen were fond {{of their}} niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their {{attempts}} {{to forge a}} close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent, the young princess' widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, [...] "I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months <b>longer...</b> <b>I</b> should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not {{in the hands of a}} person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed." [...] The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as [...] "a good old man, though eccentric and singular". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. [...] "Poor old man!", Victoria wrote as he was dying, [...] "I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit <b>longer,</b> <b>I</b> believe he would have." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Hawthornes {{had three}} children. Their first was {{daughter}} Una, born March 3, 1844; {{her name was}} a reference to The Faerie Queene, to the displeasure of family members.

There is no escaping it any <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> have business on earth now, and must look about me for the means of doing it." [...] In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem. In 1846, their son Julian was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846: [...] "A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew." [...] Daughter Rose was born in May 1851, and Hawthorne called her his [...] "autumnal flower".|$|E

2500|$|Other {{songs of}} the album are of a private nature. The song [...] "Achterbahn" [...] was written by Plate {{following}} a state of panic in his flat which caused him to shout [...] "Ich kann nicht mehr! Ich will nicht mehr!" [...] ("I can't go on any <b>longer!</b> <b>I</b> want to end it all!"). These words are sung {{at the start of}} the song. Another song, [...] "Amo Vitam", initially contained the lines [...] "Ich liebe das Leben, ich liebe den Sex, doch warum bin ich einsam?" [...] ("I love life, I love sex, but why am I lonely?"). The lines, written by Plate, were translated into Latin for the final produced song by a friend with the help of his former Latin teacher. Latin was used because Plate felt that the language sounded very dramatic.|$|E

I don't know how much <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> can do this. Please bring me home." [...] Of Corby, Howard said: [...] "I feel for her. I {{understand}} why there's a lot of public sympathy for her; I would simply say that I hope justice is done and it's a fair and true verdict ... I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us how we should handle , we would react very angrily to that." [...] The Australian Labor Party generally supported the government's approach to the case in not wanting to interfere in Indonesia's judicial system, while Australian Greens leader Bob Brown criticised the verdict.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{things are}} {{different}} throughout the game if the player is playing as a neutral character. For example, the letter from Blackmore is to Cory, not Torque, telling him Torque doesn't really love him. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds Torque that Blackmore had manipulated Cory. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide. In the final battle, neither Blackmore nor Torque is able to win, and when they approach one another they are repelled away from touching. Blackmore points out [...] "Looks like we're going {{to play this game}} a while <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't change you, and you couldn't get rid of me. The ties that bind, they'll keep us connected, but apart. And I'll be right here, standing over your shoulder." ...|$|E

2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated [...] "the timing and choice were inspired", and Mark Steyn stated he was [...] "happy" [...] over the choice. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said of Palin, [...] "She is strong. She is capable. She is articulate," [...] and suggested opponents should not underestimate her. Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} {{exactly the same thing}} at the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> think about it, the less well this selection sits with me.... If it were your decision, and you were putting your country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [...] a heartbeat away from the presidency?". Following an NBC interview, Peggy Noonan commented, [...] "It's over... the most qualified? No." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{constitutional}} convention took up {{the compromise}} amendment approved in 2004. It failed on a vote of 157-39 on September 14, after many moderate legislators who had initially supported it refused to and most legislators opposed to same-sex marriage abandoned its compromise language. State Senator Brian Lees, a Republican who co-sponsored the amendment in the previous convention, explained why he withdrew his support: [...] "Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for {{the citizens of the}} commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry. This amendment which was an appropriate measure or compromise a year ago, is no <b>longer,</b> <b>I</b> feel, a compromise today." [...] Opponents turned instead to an alternative method of amending the constitution that they thought would allow them to present an uncompromising ban on same-sex marriage to the voters. This method would require the collection of thousands of signatures on petitions but would need the support of only a quarter of the legislators to become a referendum. The process of gathering signatures was already underway when the legislators voted to reject the 2004 compromise. Travis explained that the opponents' fervor came in reaction to the position taken by gay and lesbian activists: ...|$|E

And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men.

[...] I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that {{one or more of the}} Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.|$|E
