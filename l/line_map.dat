50|$|In {{the case}} of a polygon, all points on each edge share the same tangent <b>line,</b> and thus <b>map</b> to the same vertex of the dual, while the tangent line of a vertex is ill-defined, and can be {{interpreted}} as all the lines passing through it with angle between the two edges. This accords both with projective duality (<b>lines</b> <b>map</b> to points, and points to lines), and with the limit of smooth curves with no linear component: as a curve flattens to an edge, its tangent <b>lines</b> <b>map</b> to closer and closer points; as a curve sharpens to a vertex, its tangent lines spread further apart.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{much longer}} {{intervals}} between services {{than during the}} day, night routes often offer guarantee transfers to other lines or transit modes (such as regional and intercity rail). To ease planning, many cities use a central hub where all lines converge at a specific time. This makes the <b>line</b> <b>map</b> of many night services look like a wheel with radial lines to the center and some additional lines connecting the outer ends (or running along a ring road outside of the city center).|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} authors {{concerned}} with the analysis of rock jointing have used {{the idea that the}} joint areal or diametral distribution can be linked to the trace length distribution through a theorem attributed to Crofton. This brief paper seeks to demonstrate why Crofton 2 ̆ 7 s theorem need not be used to link moments of the trace length distribution captured by scan <b>line</b> or areal <b>mapping</b> to the moments of the diametral distribution of joints represented as disks and that it is incorrect to do so. The valid relationships for areal or scan <b>line</b> <b>mapping</b> between all the moments of the trace length distribution and those of the joint size distribution for joints modeled as disks are recalled and compared with those that might be applied were Crofton 2 ̆ 7 s theorem assumed to apply.

The line intersects with Line 1 at Baquedano station and San Pablo station, with Line 2 at Santa Ana station, and with Line 4 at Vicente Valdés station. It will also intersect with the future Line 6 at Ñuble station and with the future Line 3 at both Plaza de Armas station and Irarrázaval station.

Line 11 and 13 share colors, as do lines 18 and 19. Some tram maps distinguish between them by giving line 11 a lighter green than line 13, and by making the yellow of line 19 more orange. Up until the 2005 restructuring of the tram system {{there was also a}} line 10 (Jar-Skøyen-Aker Brygge-Jernbanetorget-Ullevål-Rikshospitalet), color-coded blue and a line 15 (Grefsen-Trondheimsveien-Nationaltheateret-Majorstuen), color-coded red.|$|E

We briefly describe how these tracers of the star-formation rate at z ∼ 8 can be modeled jointly before forecasting their auto- and cross-power spectra measurements with the nominal 21 cm EoR survey. The use of multiple line tracers would be invaluable to validate and enrich {{our understanding of the}} EoR.
