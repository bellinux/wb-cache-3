40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in the Astrophysical Journal We have used the WFPC 2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain deep F 814 W images of a blank field in the Virgo Cluster located 41 ′ northwest of M 87. We perform star counts in that field, and in another Virgo field observed by Ferguson, Tanvir, & von Hippel (1998), and show that, {{when compared to the}} Hubble Deep Field North and South, the Virgo Cluster contains an excess of objects with magnitudes I � 27. We attribute this excess to a population of intracluster red-giant branch (IC-RGB) stars. By modeling the luminosity function of these stars, we show that the tip of the Virgo RGB is at ITRGB ∼ 27. 31 + 0. 27 − 0. 17 and that the cluster contains a small, but significant, excess of stars that are up to ∼ 1 mag brighter than this tip. If this luminous component is due entirely to stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), it implies an age for the population of> 2 Gyr; if foreground RGB stars contribute to the <b>luminous</b> <b>tail,</b> then the derived age for the stars is older still. The luminosity function also suggests that most of the intracluster stars are moderately metal-rich (− 0. 8 � [Fe/H] � − 0. 2), a result consisten...|$|E
40|$|We report {{extensive}} observational {{data for}} {{five of the}} lowest redshift Super-Luminous Type Ic Supernovae (SL-SNe Ic) discovered to date, namely PTF 10 hgi, SN 2011 ke, PTF 11 rks, SN 2011 kf and SN 2012 il. Photometric imaging of the transients at + 50 to + 230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtraction reveals a <b>luminous</b> <b>tail</b> phase for four of these SL-SNe. A high resolution, optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broad He I λ 10830 emission line in the spectrum (+ 50 d) of SN 2012 il, revealing {{that at least some}} SL-SNe Ic are not completely helium free. At first sight, the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with the radioactive decay of 56 Co, and would require 1 - 4 M ⊙ of 56 Ni to produce the luminosity. These 56 Ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusion times at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. We instead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source for these objects. A semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from the spindown of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. The model predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required are in reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. We derive magnetar energies of 0. 4 � E(10 51 erg) � 6. 9 and ejecta masse...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{quiescent}} emission of anomalous X-ray pulsars/soft gamma-ray repeaters (AXPs/SGRs) is powered by accretion from a fallback disk, requiring magnetic dipole fields in the range 1012 - 1013 G, and that the <b>luminous</b> hard <b>tails</b> of their X-ray spectra are produced by bulk-motion Comptonization in the radiative shock {{near the bottom of}} the accretion column. This radiation escapes as a fan beam, which is partly absorbed by the polar cap photosphere, heating it up to relatively high temperatures. The scattered component and the thermal emission from the polar cap form a polar beam. We test our model on the well-studied AXP 4 U 0142 + 61, whose energy-dependent pulse profiles show double peaks, which we ascribe to the fan and polar beams. The temperature of the photosphere (kT ~ 0. 4 keV) is explained by the heating effect. The scattered part forms a hard component in the polar beam. We suggest that the observed high temperatures of the polar caps of AXPs/SGRs, compared with other young neutron stars, are due to the heating by the fan beam. Using beaming functions for the fan beam and the polar beam and taking gravitational bending into account, we fit the energy-dependent pulse profiles and obtain the inclination angle and the angle between the spin axis and the magnetic dipole axis, as well as the height of the radiative shock above the stellar surface. We do not explain the high-luminosity bursts, which may be produced by the classical magnetar mechanism operating in super-strong multipole fields...|$|R
40|$|Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) {{are some}} of the {{brightest}} phenomena found outside of a galaxy's nucleus, and their explanation typically invokes accretion of material onto a black hole. Here, we perform the largest population study to date of ULXs in early-type galaxies, focusing on whether a galaxy's large scale environment can affect its ULX content. Using the AMUSE survey, which includes homogeneous X-ray coverage of 100 elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster and a similar number of elliptical galaxies in the field (spanning stellar masses of 1 e 8 - 1 e 12 M_sun), we identify 37. 9 +/- 10. 1 ULXs in Virgo and 28. 1 +/- 8. 7 ULXs in the field. Across both samples, we constrain the number of ULXs per unit stellar mass, i. e., the ULX specific frequency, to be 0. 062 +/- 0. 013 ULXs per 10 ^ 10 M_sun (or about 1 ULX per 1. 6 e 11 M_sun of galaxy stellar mass). We find that the number of ULXs, the specific frequency of ULXs, and the average ULX spectral properties are all similar in both cluster and field environments. Contrary to late-type galaxies, we do not see any trend between specific ULX frequency and host galaxy stellar mass, and we show that dwarf ellipticals host fewer ULXs than later-type dwarf galaxies at a statistically meaningful level. Our results are consistent with ULXs in early-type galaxies probing the <b>luminous</b> <b>tail</b> of the low-mass X-ray binary population, and are briefly discussed in context of the influence of gravitational interactions on the long-term evolution of a galaxy's (older) stellar population.

40|$|We {{quantify}} the systematics in the size-luminosity relation of {{galaxies in the}} SDSS main sample which arise from fitting different 1 - and 2 -component model profiles to the images. In objects brighter than L*, fitting a single Sersic profile to what is really a two-component SerExp system leads to biases: the half-light radius is increasingly overestimated as n of the fitted single component increases; it is also overestimated at B/T ~ 0. 6. However, the net effect on the R-L relation is small, except for the most <b>luminous</b> <b>tail,</b> where it curves upwards towards larger sizes. We also study how this relation depends on morphological type. Our analysis {{is one of the}} first to use Bayesian-classifier derived weights, rather than hard cuts, to define morphology. Crudely, there appear to be only two relations: one for early-types (Es, S 0 s and Sa's) and another for late-types (Sbs and Scds). However, closer inspection shows that within the early-type sample S 0 s tend to be 15 % smaller than Es of the same luminosity, and, among faint late types, Sbs are more than 25 % smaller than Scds. Neither the early- nor the late-type relations are pure power-laws: both show significant curvature, which we quantify. However, the R-L relations of the bulges of early-types are almost pure power laws. Our analysis confirms that two mass scales are special for early-type galaxies: M* = 3 e 10 and 2 e 11 Msun. These same mass scales are also special for late types: there is almost no correlation between R and M* below the former, and almost no late-types above the latter. We also show that the intrinsic scatter around the relation decreases at large luminosity and/or stellar mass; this should provide additional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed.

40|$|We {{have used}} the WFPC 2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain deep F 814 W images of a blank field in the Virgo Cluster located 41 arcmin {{northwest}} of M 87. We perform star counts in that field, and in another Virgo field observed by Ferguson, Tanvir & von Hippel (1998), and show that, {{when compared to the}} Hubble Deep Field North and South, the Virgo Cluster contains an excess of objects with magnitudes I > 27. We attribute this excess to a population of intracluster red-giant branch (IC-RGB) stars. By modeling the luminosity function of these stars, we show that the tip of the Virgo RGB is at I = 27. 31 + 0. 27 /- 0. 17 and that the cluster contains a small, but significant, excess of stars that are up to ~ 1 mag brighter than this tip. If this luminous component is due entirely to stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), it implies an age for the population of > 2 Gyr; if foreground RGB stars contribute to the <b>luminous</b> <b>tail,</b> then the derived age for the stars is older still. The luminosity function also suggests that most of the intracluster stars are moderately metal-rich (- 0. 8 < [Fe/H] <- 0. 2), a result consistent with that expected from stars that have been tidally stripped from intermediate luminosity galaxies. Additionally, a comparison with the planetary nebulae in our field also supports this view, although the existence of a more metal-poor population (from stripped dwarfs) cannot be ruled out. Our derived average surface brightness, mu_I = 27. 9 + 0. 3 /- 0. 5 mag/arcsec^ 2 for Virgo's diffuse component suggests that intracluster stars contribute 10 % to 20 % of the cluster's total I-band luminosity.

40|$|We present {{spatially}} resolved X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B 1951 + 32 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 80 using a Chandra observation. The Chandra X-ray map reveals clearly {{various components}} of a ram-pressure confined PWN embedded in the SNR ejecta: a point source representing the pulsar, X-ray emission from the bow shock, a <b>luminous</b> X-ray <b>tail,</b> a 30 diameter plateau whose northwestern part is absent, and the outside more diffuse X-ray emission. The plateau is just surrounded by the radio, [O III], [S II], and [N II] shells, and the outside diffuse emission is mostly within the Hα shells. While the spectra of all the features are well fitted with power law models, a power law plus blackbody model can fit the spectrum of the pulsar significantly better than using a power law model alone. Generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening from the inside to the outside. However, {{the edge of the}} plateau probably has a harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau. The cause of the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear, and we speculate that it might be due to a shock between the PWN and the SNR ejecta. The possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of 0. 13 ± 0. 02 keV and an equivalent emitting radius of 2. 2 ^+ 1. 4 _- 0. 8 (d/ 2 kpc) km, and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar. We also show in this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of PSR B 1951 + 32 is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models.

40|$|We use {{the first}} {{systematic}} data sets of CO molecular line emission in z~ 1 - 3 normal star forming galaxies for {{a comparison of}} the dependence of galaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and high redshifts, and in different galactic environments. Although the current high-z samples are still small and biased toward the <b>luminous</b> and massive <b>tail</b> of the actively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging. Independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities are considered, low- and high-z SFG galaxy populations appear to follow similar molecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1. 1 to 1. 2. The gas-depletion time scale in these SFGs grows from 0. 5 Gyrs at z~ 2 to 1. 5 Gyrs at z~ 0. Because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller than the Hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gas fractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo and stellar feedback. In contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at both low-z and high-z produce on average 4 to 10 times more far-infrared luminosity per unit gas mass. Only some fraction of this difference can be explained by uncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must be intrinsic. The most likely interpretation is that the star formation relation is driven by global dynamical effects. For a given mass, the more compact merger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. When the dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, disk galaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations. The mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than the disks. Comment: accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} catalog of 2 D, PSF-corrected de Vacouleurs, Sérsic, de Vacouleurs + Exponential, and 2 ̆ 6 Sacute;ersic + Exponential fits of ∼ 7 × 105 spectroscopically {{selected}} galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. Fits are performed for the SDSS r-band utilizing the fitting routine GALFIT and analysis pipeline PYMORPH. Simulations are {{used to test the}} two-dimensional decompositions of SDSS galaxies. We compare these fits to prior catalogs and present a physically motivated flagging system which suggests that more than 90 per cent of two-component fits can be used for analysis. The catalogs provide a robust set of structural and photometric parameters for future galaxy studies. The catalog is then extended into the g-band and i-band. The data and fitted images are available online at [URL]. ^ Two applications of the catalog are presented. The sensitivity to the choice of light profile and its affect on the massive end of the stellar mass function is quantified. The total stellar mass density at z ∼ 0. 1 is about 1. 2 times larger than in previous analysis of the SDSS using the new catalog. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number density of objects having M* {{greater than or equal to}} 6 × 1011 M[special character omitted] is approximately five times larger. The systematics of fitting different model profiles on the size-luminosity relation of galaxies in the SDSS (i. e. at z ∼ 0. 1) are also quantified in the r-band. The net effect on the R-L relation is small, except for the most <b>luminous</b> <b>tail.</b> Neither the early- nor the late-type relations are pure power laws: both show significant curvature, which we quantify. This curvature confirms that two mass scales are special for both early- and late-type galaxies: M* ∼ 3 × 10 10 and 2 × 1011 M[special character omitted]. The intrinsic scatter in the R-L relation is shown to decrease at large L and/or M* and should provide additional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed. ^ Future work applying the analysis to DES and LSST galaxies at higher redshifts is suggested to further constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution at higher redshifts. ...|$|E
