50|$|After {{the initial}} {{carousel}} <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> {{development and the}} later development of the linear <b>stripping</b> <b>machine,</b> Falconbridge personnel developed the Kidd Process High Capacity Linear Machine (“HCLM”). This machine included a loading and unloading system {{that was based on}} robotics.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> {{included}} receiving and discharge conveyors, washing, separation, cathode stacking and discharging, {{cathode plate}} separation for refurbishing, and the wax {{applications for the}} sides and bottoms of the cathode plates. The original CRL <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> had the capability of stripping 250 cathode plates per hour.|$|R

50|$|The Kidd Process {{initially}} used a “carousel” <b>stripping</b> <b>machine,</b> but {{a linear}} installation was subsequently developed to provide machines with lower to medium stripping capacities for electrowinning plants and smaller refineries. The linear <b>stripping</b> <b>machines,</b> first installed in 1996, were more compact, less complex and had lower installation costs than the carousel machines.|$|R
50|$|A laser wire {{stripper}} is a computer-controlled machine, {{much like a}} CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire. Laser wire <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> are used mostly for very fine gauge wires since they do not damage the conductor. A typical CO2 laser wire <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> should be capable of stripping the insulation from any size wire.|$|R

50|$|The {{variation}} in copper deposits on the cathode plates {{was one of}} the difficulties encountered with the earlier <b>stripping</b> <b>machines.</b> Areas of thin copper on the cathode plates, which are caused by short circuits, are difficult to separate from the stainless steel plate due to their lack of rigidity. Plates bearing such areas generally had to be rejected from the <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> and <b>stripped</b> manually. Similarly, sticky copper deposits (generally related to poor surface condition on the cathode plate, such as corroded surfaces or improper mechanical treatment), heavily nodulated cathode and laminated copper caused problems for stripping.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the relics of rock joints caulked with <b>lead</b> <b>strips,</b> unearthed {{by the authors}} in 2007 and 2008. The relics were in ancient quarry caverns in Shepan Island, Zhejiang Province, eastern China. The quarry activities were mainly carried out for production of regular tuff stone plates about 800 years ago. Each of the <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> was sealed into a rock joint by punching manually and carefully. At present, the <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> still contact tightly with the rock joints and new mineral cerussite is found to have formed at the contact surfaces between the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> and its caulked rock joint. The use of <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> caulking rock joints in quarry caverns is found for prevention of water from seeping {{out of the country}} rocks into quarry cavern bases, where all of the in-situ intact tuff rock was manually and near-horizontally split into thin rock sheets one by one for production of regular tuff plates. Furthermore, it is found that the tensile splitting of tuff sheets at the cavern base required the intact rocks at the cavern base had to be dry. Through this horizontal base splitting for tuff sheets from the top to the bottom, a dome-shape interior space was formed for each rock cavern with the near horizontal imprints of thin sheet layers permanently on the sidewalls. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Falconbridge began {{marketing}} {{the technology in}} 1992, after many requests from other refinery operators. Thus, the Kidd Process created competition between two suppliers of permanent cathode technology. The main differences between them were the cathode header bar, edge stripping and the <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> technology.|$|R
50|$|He {{has worked}} for 2000 AD, mainly on cover work (where he started in 1994) and the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> Judge Dredd, {{as well as some}} British small press comics, like The End Is Nigh.|$|R
50|$|The focus then {{shifted to}} {{developing}} a <b>stripping</b> <b>machine,</b> to develop stainless steel cathodes incorporating the existing header bars and evaluating edge-strip technology. The company’s board of directors gave approval for {{the conversion of the}} refinery to the Kidd technology in April 1985. The conversion was completed in 1986 and the Kidd refinery became the third to install permanent cathode and automated stripping technology.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the successes}} of Wham! (1964) and Smash! (1966) Odhams were keen to expand their line of weekly Power Comics in 1967. In January they {{launched}} Pow! with 'Spider-Man' as the <b>lead</b> <b>strip,</b> and a month later saw {{the arrival of a}} comic that consisted almost entirely of Marvel reprints: Fantastic.|$|R
50|$|The {{new design}} improved, among other things, the {{discharge}} {{area of the}} stripper. This had been a problem area for the carousel <b>stripping</b> <b>machines,</b> in which copper released from the cathode plate fell into an envelope and was then transferred to a material handling device. Copper that misbehaved and failed to transfer often required manual intervention. The new robot discharge system eliminated the free falling of the copper and physically transferred the released copper to the discharge location.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{comes from}} <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> that were put between set lines of lead type, hence the {{pronunciation}} [...] "ledding" [...] and not [...] "leeding". When type was set by hand in printing presses, slugs, or <b>strips</b> of <b>lead</b> of appropriate thicknesses were inserted {{between the lines}} of type to add vertical space, improving legibility.|$|R

50|$|Bull {{was known}} for his {{creation}} of an agricultural <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> which he developed but was controversially beaten to the title of inventor by John Ridley. The controversy was again revived in 1875, when the University of Adelaide proposed to establish a 'Ridley' chair of agriculture. Bull successful petitioned parliament in 1880 for a grant of recognition of his invention and after a long inquiry, was given £250 in 1882 'for services in improving agricultural machinery'. Later research has supported Ridley's claim.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} cathode <b>stripping</b> <b>machine</b> {{was based}} on that used at the Hikoshima plant of the Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company of Japan. However, considerable development work was necessary to modify the design to handle the copper cathodes, which were heavier than those at Hikoshima, and to process the cathode plates without damaging them. The machines also had to be redesigned to allow for waxing the sides and bottoms of the cathode plates to allow the next copper cathode sheets to be removed easily.|$|R
50|$|Individual Anatolian hieroglyphs are attested {{from the}} second and early first millennia BC across Anatolia and into modern Syria. The {{earliest}} examples occur on personal seals, but these consist only of names, titles, and auspicious signs, {{and it is not}} certain that they represent language. Most actual texts are found as monumental inscriptions in stone, though a few documents have survived on <b>lead</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cotton can be {{recycled}} from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during {{the production of}} yarn, fabrics and textile products, e.g. selvage from weaving and fabric from factory cutting rooms. Post-consumer waste comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> that first breaks the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.|$|R
50|$|The 557 was {{prone to}} jamming of the lifter bars and {{resulted}} in what the CEs called a “Rack & Wheel” job. This meant <b>stripping</b> the <b>machine</b> down to its base and rebuilding it, an 8-hour job.|$|R
50|$|The grid is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of alternating parallel <b>strips</b> of <b>lead</b> and a radiolucent substance such as a plastic, carbon fibre, aluminium, even paper. The grid is placed between the patient and the detector during the exposure. Primary beam radiation passes through the radiolucent strips as it travels roughly parallel to them, but scattered radiation which has, almost by definition, deviated from the parallel beam, cannot easily pass through the grid as it encounters the <b>lead</b> <b>strips</b> at an angle, and is attenuated, or lost, from the beam.|$|R
5000|$|The PM-79 is a small, {{circular}} Bulgarian blast-resistant anti-personnel mine, superficially {{similar to}} the Russian PMN. The mine uses a unique trigger design; {{on the top of}} the mine, beneath a thin rubber cover is a dish shaped pressure plate. Pressure on the outer rim of the dish shaped plate levers up a central post, which triggers the mine. The mine also incorporates a mechanical arming delay using a pin cutting through a thin <b>lead</b> <b>strip.</b> The mine arms in between two minutes and four hours depending on the temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Eagle, Girl {{was founded}} by the Rev. Marcus Morris. The <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> was {{originally}} [...] "Kitty Hawke and her All-Girl Air Crew", drawn in full colour by Ray Bailey, {{about a group of}} women running a charter airline. The strip was not very popular - it was apparently felt to be too masculine - and it was moved to the black and white interior pages, replaced on the cover by the schoolgirl strip [...] "Wendy and Jinx", written by Michael and Valerie Hastings and drawn by Bailey.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{published}} {{under the}} title Playhour Pictures, the title was shortened with issue 32 to Playhour. Playhour {{was intended as a}} companion to Jack and Jill, initially aimed at a slightly older audience. The <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> in its early days was [...] "Prince, the Wonder Dog of the Golden West", drawn by Sep E. Scott. With issue 32 (21 May 1955) it lowered its target age-group and introduced comic strips based on A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, both drawn by Peter Woolcock.|$|R
50|$|The PMN-1 mine is armed by {{removing}} a steel ring-pull {{at the end}} of the horizontal fuze. When in position, the pin on the end of the ring-pull holds a spring-loaded striker back from the stab-detonator. Pulling out the ring-pull starts an arming delay, which comprises a thin steel wire (held under tension by the spring-loaded striker) which must cut through a small <b>strip</b> of <b>lead</b> before it is freed. The process of cutting through the <b>lead</b> <b>strip</b> takes between 2 and 12 minutes, depending on ambient temperature. After the wire has completely cut through the <b>lead</b> <b>strip,</b> the spring-loaded striker is freed and slides forward a few millimetres before stopping, blocked by the sliding gate of the pressure plate mechanism. At this point the mine is fully armed i.e. the only thing holding back the spring-loaded striker from the stab-detonator is a weak creep-spring on the pressure plate mechanism. Subsequently, any downward pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when someone steps on the mine) overcomes the upward pressure of the creep-spring and pushes down the sliding gate that holds back the spring-loaded striker. This action frees the striker which flips forward into the stab detonator, firing both it and the adjacent tetryl booster which triggers detonation of the main TNT explosive filling. It is not a blast resistant mine.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{automatic}} <b>stripping</b> <b>machines</b> requires a uniform and low adherence of electrowon zinc to aluminium starting sheets. Some impurities in the electrolyte severely affect this adherence. The strong effect of F− ions is first reported. Two pretreatments aimed at lowering the adherence are then compared. Brushing the aluminium blanks gives excellent results whereas anodization, even {{for long periods}} of time, is less effective. Influence of these pretreatments on the electrical parameters of zinc deposition has also been examined and economical conclusions are drawn. Differences in the electrocrystallization of zinc on low and high adherence areas are indicated by scanning electron microscopy examination. Mechanisms are proposed to explain the experimental observations. © 1980, All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
