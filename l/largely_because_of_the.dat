5|$|The lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, {{much of the}} area around the lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).|$|E
5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variety of species and habitats. The {{area around the}} pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids {{can be seen on}} the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University hosts notable {{speakers}} each year, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} the Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. These are frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.|$|E

25|$|The Notitia {{depicts the}} Roman army at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AD 4th century. Therefore, its {{development}} from <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principate is <b>largely</b> conjectural <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> other evidence.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. <b>Largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E
5|$|The buyout of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E
50|$|Donohue {{syndrome}} {{was first}} identified in 1948 by Canadian pathologist William L. Donohue (1906-1985). The name leprechaunism has been <b>largely</b> abandoned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name by some parents of patients as insulting.|$|R
50|$|Evelyn is <b>largely</b> {{isolated}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hours she}} has to spend caring {{for the children and}} <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> local intellectual equals. However, she is contacted by a group of other contest-entering mid-western housewives and befriends them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> habits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunda {{clouded leopard}} are <b>largely</b> unknown <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal's secretive nature.

5|$|The keel of {{the fourth}} ship of the class was laid at the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard on 20 July 1937. She was {{originally}} to have been named Jellicoe, after Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, {{the commander of the}} Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but she was renamed Anson in February 1940. Anson was launched on 24 February 1940 and was completed on 22 June 1942. Completion was delayed <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of fire-control radar, and additional anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
5|$|Plans to have trams {{run through}} the city center have existed since 1919. In the late 1940s, Holmenkolbanen revised the plan, and {{proposed}} extending the Common Tunnel eastwards. From 1951, the municipality started working on plans for the Oslo Metro {{in the eastern part}} of the city. The large difference in traffic between the eastern and western lines caused the plans to be changed during the 1960s, and the eastern network was equipped with third rail power supply. The eastern lines at first terminated at Jernbanetorget, and the plans were to continue the lines onwards towards Bislett. But by the 1970s, these plans changed, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increase of traffic in the west and decrease in the east. On 7 March 1987, the services from the west, including the Røa Line, were extended from Nationaltheatret to Stortinget, a station that allowed transfer to the metro.|$|E
5|$|The {{money raised}} for the Victory Loan {{campaign}} on If Day was $3.2million, {{which was the}} city's largest single-day total. Winnipeg passed its $24million Victory Loan quota on 24 February, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects of If Day. The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60million, well above its target quota of $45million. The campaign raised approximately $2billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day {{was considered one of}} the most successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive. Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February.|$|E
25|$|Some protest {{figures such}} as Svetoslav Nikolov, who was behind <b>the</b> {{initiative}} <b>of</b> setting up tents on <b>the</b> western side <b>of</b> Parliament on 17 June 2013, declared themselves <b>largely</b> satisfied <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peevski resignation and the changes to the electoral rules implemented by the Oresharski cabinet.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{appearance}} <b>of</b> extrasolar planets is <b>largely</b> unknown <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulty in}} making direct observations of extrasolar planets. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System {{can apply for}} few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extrasolar planets known; because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example the hot Jupiters.|$|R
50|$|From {{a base of}} only 20,000 {{people in}} 1793, the city grew to {{approximately}} 117,000 people in 1912. Population growth was rapid after 1870, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> emigration from <b>the</b> eastern highlands.|$|R
5|$|During {{the final}} quarter of 2010the station's first as a {{national}} broadcasterlistening figures rose to 3.08 million, which remained unchanged {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, although listenership in London increased by 29%, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Simon Bates on the breakfast show in January 2011. Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Zahir had an {{aide who}} jointly {{served in the}} {{capacity}} of mudabbir (manager) and wazir (vizier) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence. This official {{had always been a}} Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first wazir was Yusuf al-Arqash, followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to Malta. He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh, who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local Greek Orthodox Christian and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite. Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in Damietta, Egypt. Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to arguments against physician-assisted dying, opponents feared that terminally ill {{people throughout the}} nation would flock to Oregon to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.
