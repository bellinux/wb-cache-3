5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the Lancet reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study also found that state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> gun-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E

5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5â€“7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> efficacy.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

Patients undergoing CABG also had <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> repeat revascularization. The New York State registry included all patients undergoing revascularization for coronary artery disease, but was not a randomized trial, and so may have reflected other factors besides the method of coronary revascularization.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-period overlapping-generations model with environmental externalities and uncertain lifetimes, and studies how two sources of population aging, greater longevity and a <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population growth, affect the politically determined environmental tax {{and the quality}} of the environment. It is shown that greater longevity and a <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population growth have entirely different effects on these factors; greater longevity has no effect on the environmental tax and has a non-positive effect on the environmental quality, whereas a <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> population growth has a negative effect on the tax and has a positive effect on the quality. In addition, the political decision-making on the tax leads to an inefficient allocation of capital and environmental quality.

25|$|Chlorpromazine is {{classified}} as a low-potency typical antipsychotic {{and in the past}} was used in the treatment of both acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder, as well as amphetamine-induced psychoses. Low-potency antipsychotics have more anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth, sedation, and constipation, and <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> extrapyramidal side effects, while high-potency antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) have the reverse profile.|$|E

25|$|The {{most serious}} adverse effect is bleeding, {{including}} severe internal bleeding. Rivaroxaban {{is associated with}} <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> serious and fatal bleeding events than warfarin but is associated with higher rates of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. There is currently no antidote for rivaroxaban (unlike warfarin, the action {{of which can be}} reversed with vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrate), meaning that serious bleeding may be difficult to manage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} NSAIDs, COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitors (such as celecoxib) are equally effective {{when compared to}} nonselective NSAIDs, and have <b>lower</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction.

25|$|Given the {{potential}} consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents.
