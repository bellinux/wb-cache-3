On the belt sometimes is possible to distinguish a buckle in the middle or thongs hanging from it with sometimes attached bag, a round metal pocket mirror, knife, comb, sometimes also is shown (male statues) a dagger or a straight sword, a bow, a ‘kolchan’ (quiver), a hook, an axe. On the neck the men wear a metal band, women wear a necklace of beads or scales, sometimes even 2 or 3 are visible, some have a wide tape or a belt dropping from the necklace, ending with a 4-corner cloth.

Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced.|$|R
40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{is a common}} production constraint in rice cultivation in temperate zones and high-elevation environments, {{with the potential to}} affect growth and development from germination to grain filling. There is a wide range of genotype-based differences in cold tolerance among rice varieties, these differences often reflecting growth conditions in the place of origin, as well as breeding history. However, improving low temperature tolerance of varieties has been difficult, {{due to a lack of}} clarity of the genetic basis to low temperature tolerance for different growth stages of the rice plant. Seeds or plants of 17 rice varieties of different origins were exposed to low temperature during germination (15 degrees C), seedling, booting, and flowering stages (18. 5 degrees C), to assess their cold tolerance at different growth stages. Low temperature at the germination stage reduced both the percentage and speed of germination. Varieties from China (B 55, Banjiemang, and Lijianghegu) and Hungary (HSC 55) were more tolerant of low temperature than other varieties. Most of the varieties showed moderate levels of low temperature tolerance during the seedling stage, the exceptions being some varieties from Australia (Pelde, YRL 39, and YRM 64) and Africa (WAB 160 and WAB 38), which were susceptible to low temperature at the seedling stage. <b>Low</b> temperature at <b>booting</b> and flowering stages reduced plant growth and caused a significant decline in spikelet fertility.

40|$|In sports where {{high speed}} is involved, races are often won by milliseconds. Any {{advantage}} {{can then be}} important {{in order to reach}} the success. The drag acting on the athletes is often the highest force that the athletes have to fight against and, even a small reduction of drag, can create an advantage in terms of performances. However, in sports like ski jumping, the aerodynamic involved gets to be more complex, involving drag and lift force. Wind tunnel measurements have been carried out in the last century {{in order to understand the}} physics behind phenomena linked to sport activities (for example ball aerodynamics) or in order to optimize postures and materials. With the performances enhancement as final goal the aerodynamics behind a number of sports have been previously studied. Posture optimization, low drag bycicles, skin suits or even the recent and famous Speedo swimming suits are only some of the achievements of the research carried out. In the present thesis, a wide approach to the topic with particular focus on textile aerodynamics has been used. The thesis has then be divided into two main areas: A research Area 1 named Textiles and their effect on the aerodynamics of athletes and referred RA 1 where the influence of textiles and clothing equipement on the drag acting against the athletes have been studied and a Research Area 2 named Performances and Prototyping where more practical examples of how aerodynamics can directy affect athletes performances are given and exposed. In RA 1 the topography of textiles have been studied and the surface structure properties has been linked to the aerodynamic properties with particular regards to drag reduction and turbulence tripping. In order to simplify the case the athlete’s body has been simplified as a serie of cylindrical shapes and tests have been carried out mostly on cylinders. Effect of yaw angle, different speed, different diameter, different roughness, different material and distance between body parts have been analyzed. At the same time, test on existing suits have been carried out and a mathematical model in order to estimate performances in speed skating has been made. In RA 2 different side projects have been carried out and the results can be summarized as follow: Effects of body weight in ski jumping has been analyzed in order to figure out if the new rules imposed by the FIS (International Ski Federation) were effective in order to reduce the increasing problem of anorexia amongst ski jumpers. Wind tunnel measurements were carried out in order to find the aerodynamic forces acting on a ski jumper in his flight path. The experimental data were then implemented into a mathematical model which is able to simulate the in-run and the flight path. In cycling, the attention was focused on the posture assumed by the cyclists with the goal of reducing the drag while keeping a good biomechanical efficiency. The rules imposed by UCI (International Cycling Union) set the boundaries. However, a impressively good result has been obtained focusing the attention on each athlete and finding a subjective optimum posture for each of the athletes tested. A <b>low</b> drag ski <b>boot</b> have been designed with a airfoiled shape which permitted to obtain an impressive drag reduction on the total drag acting on a downhill skier. Speed skating suits have been tested in order to quantify the influence of different model suits on skating performances. The suit used by torwegian Olympic team of ski-cross has been designed using the knowledge acquired and presented in RA 1. An impressive drag reduction has been obtained and it helped two norwegian athletes to win a silver and a bronze medal at theWinter Olympic Games in Vancouver 2010. As previously mentioned, the research areas are: Research Area 1 - Textiles and their effect on the aerodynamics of athletes Research Area 2 - Performances and prototyping The main contributions are: P 1 : Reducing the Athlete’s aerodynamics P 2 : Experimental analysis on parameters affecting drag force on athletes P 3 : Aerodynamic and comfort properties of single jersey textiles for high speed sports P 4 : Aerodynamic behavior of single sport jersey fabrics with different roughness and cover factors P 5 : Effect of different skin suits on speed skating performances P 6 : Aerodynamic optimization and energy saving of cycling postures for international elite level cyclists P 7 : Effects of body weight on Ski Jumping performances under the new FIS rules P 8 : Airfolied design for alpine skiers boots P 9 : Aerodynamic and Comfort Characteristics of A Double Layer Knitted Fabric Assembly for High Speed Winter Sports P 10 : A Low Drag Suit For Ski-Cross Competition...|$|R
