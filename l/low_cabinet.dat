25|$|Villepin's cabinet {{was marked}} by its small {{membership}} (for France), and its hierarchical unity: all members had the rank of Minister, {{and there were no}} Secretaries of State, the <b>lowest</b> <b>cabinet</b> member rank. The aim of this decision was for the cabinet to form a close-knit and more efficient team to combat unemployment.|$|R
5000|$|Smilow and {{his family}} moved to Pleasantville, New York, in 1963 to live in Frank Lloyd Wright’s planned community, Usonia Homes. The Smilows {{purchased}} a home that had been built for Roger Kahn, [...] the author of The Boys of Summer and designed by Aaron Resnick, [...] one of Wright’s students. Smilow loved the designs of the homes, which integrated the forms and proportions of the outside world with the design and functionality of their interiors. The simple shapes, clean lines, subtle details, and unobtrusive beauty appealed to his aesthetic. During the 1970s, he developed a growing interest in Japanese principles of art, specifically the concept of Shibui, the Japanese design philosophy. Eventually, he would create a Shibui collection of furnishings, which featured shoji screens, and finely detailed joinery on a simple floating platform bed, and accompanying <b>low</b> <b>cabinets.</b>|$|R

The bright moonlight was streaming through the windows, throwing into strange light and shadow the heterogeneous objects that lined the long walls Greek statues and busts of Roman emperors; <b>low</b> <b>cabinets</b> filled with curiosities, natural and antiquarian; tropical birds and huge horns of beasts; Hindoo gods and strange shells; swords and daggers, and bits of chain-armour; Roman lamps and tiny models of Greek temples; and, above all these, queer old family portraits--of little boys and girls, once the hope of the Cheverels, with close-shaven heads imprisoned in stiff ruffs--of faded, pink-faced ladies, with rudimentary features and highly-developed head-dresses--of gallant gentlemen, with high hips, high shoulders, and red pointed beards.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{manufacturing}} and logistic issues of <b>low</b> voltage <b>cabinets</b> produced by ProCS, s. r. o. company. The {{aim is to}} design and evaluate manufacturing and assembling process rationalization proposal. The proposal is based on familiarization with technological process of cabinet's manufacturing. Becoming familiar with manufacturing and assembling process of marshalling and system cabinets {{made it possible to}} find an opportunity of rationalization through automation of selected assembling processes. Automation of striping and crimping process is possible through suitable crimping machine. Situation before and after rationalization is economically interpreted and evaluated using break even point analysis. Through mentioned rationalization arrangement it is possible to improve manufacturing flexibility, reduce lead times and cut down manufacturing costs...|$|R
50|$|Watson {{credited}} Bernard {{with the}} introduction of marquetry of trails of leaves and flowers in end-cut quartered veneers, often of purplewood, sometimes highlighted with stained horn and ivory set in plain matched panels of veneers of tulipwood. The lacquer panels on many pieces of Bernard's output, such as the commode and two pairs of corner cabinets in the Royal Collection or the commode stamped BVRB at the Victoria and Albert Museum (illustration), or the uncharacteristically box-like pair of <b>low</b> <b>cabinets</b> in the goût grec in the Frick Collection, New York will have been supplied to him by the marchand-mercier who commissioned such pieces, for expensive Japanese lacquer cabinets and screens, to be disassembled and incorporated in the furniture, were {{out of the reach of}} a craftsman acting on his own. Their market, too, was at the point of entry, Amsterdam, as trade with Japan was firmly in the hands of the Dutch VOC Opperhoofden. An even more luxurious finish, employing Sèvres porcelain plaques, was invented by Poirier, apparently, for he maintained a monopoly of the factory's production of these;, and Bernard was the first cabinetmaker to apply them to furniture: the earliest piece bearing porcelain plaques bears plaques of Vincennes porcelain, before the manufactory was taken under official royal patronage.Royal château marks and inventory numbers painted on many of his surviving works, related to corresponding entries in the daybooks of the Garde-Meuble du Roi, attest to his role in supplying ébénisterie to the Crown over more than two decades, often through intermediaries such as Thomas-Joachim Hébert and Lazare Duvaux; he also provided furniture for the marchand-mercier Charles Darnault.|$|R
5000|$|Already in 1959, Clairtone won {{a design}} award from Canada's National Industrial Design Council for its very first hi-fi model, the [...] "100-S"—a long, <b>low</b> teak <b>cabinet</b> {{fitted with a}} Dual (brand) 1004 turntable, a Granco tube chassis, and {{speakers}} obscured by cream-colored broadcloth from Knoll. But the most famous Clairtone design was the futuristic Project G series designed by Hugh Spencer and introduced at the National Furniture Show in Chicago in January 1964. Striking, massive (nearly seven-feet long), and expensive ($1,600, or about $12,000 today), the Project G featured an rosewood cabinet mounted on a metal base, and, at either end, cantilevered black aluminum [...] "sound globes" [...] (a.k.a. speakers). The Project G introduced the now-standard modular approach to consumer audio that offered a dramatic departure from boxy cabinet design popular until that time (and which Clairtone also manufactured). The Project G won a silver medal at the 1964 Milan Triannale and is now widely considered a design icon.|$|R
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, <b>low</b> frequency range, <b>cabinet</b> size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|R
50|$|The CPU {{for these}} system ballooned {{to about a}} dozen boards because of the low-density ECL chip footprint. As a result, CPUs could only be placed {{at each end of}} the SELbus, {{limiting}} computer systems to two CPUs. It had modular cache memory that could be upgraded. The ECL circuitry consumed huge amount of current at a very <b>low</b> voltage; the <b>cabinets</b> of the larger models contained extra rack space which held stacks of 400-amp power supplies, and heavy-gauge wiring leading to the backplane. In the mid-1990s, the RSX computer board featured RISC processing capabilities and high speed 75 ns static RAM design (essentially an all-cache design) while maintaining complete binary compatibility with existing programs.|$|R

40|$|Cerebral visual {{impairment}} (CVI) {{is one of}} the most common causes of bilateral visual loss, which frequently occurs due to perinatal brain injury. Vision in early life has great impact on acquisition of basic comprehensions which are fundamental for further development. Therefore, early detection of visual problems and early intervention is necessary. The aim of the present study is to determine specific visual functioning of children with perinatal brain damage and the influence of visual stimulation on development of functional vision at early age of life. We initially assessed 30 children with perinatal brain damage up to 3 years of age, who were reffered to our pediatric <b>low</b> vision <b>cabinet</b> in »Little house« from child neurologists, ophthalmologists Type and degree of {{visual impairment}} was determined according to functional vision assessment of each child. On the bases of those assessments different kind of visual stimulations were carried out with children who have been identified to have a certain visual impairment. Through visual stimulation program some of the children were stimulated with light stimulus, some with different materials under the ultraviolet (UV) light, and some with bright color and high contrast materials. Children were also involved in program of early stimulation of overall sensory motor development. Goals and methods of therapy were determined individually, based on observation of child’s possibilities and need. After one year of program, reassessment was done. Results for visual functions and functional vision were compared to evaluate the improvement of the vision development. These results have shown that there was significant improvement in functional vision, especially in visual attention and visual communication...|$|R
50|$|The Neo Geo {{was a very}} {{powerful}} system when released, more powerful than any video game console at the time, and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom's CPS, which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993. The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s, due to the <b>cabinet's</b> <b>low</b> cost, six ROM slots and compact size. Several successful video game series were released for the platform, such as Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, Samurai Shodown, The King of Fighters and Metal Slug. The AES had a very niche market in Japan, though sales were very low in the U.S. due to its high price for both the hardware and software; but it has since gained a cult following and is now considered a collectable. Neo Geo hardware production lasted seven years, discontinued in 1997, whereas game software production lasted until 2004, making Neo Geo the longest supported arcade system of all time. The AES console was succeeded by the Neo Geo CD and the MVS arcade by the Hyper Neo Geo 64. As of March 1997, the Neo Geo and the Neo Geo CD combined had sold 980,000 units worldwide. In 2009, the Neo Geo was ranked 19th out of the 25 best video game consoles of all time by video game website IGN.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Glasher {{was seated}} in the {{pleasant}} room where she habitually passed her mornings with her children round her. It had a square projecting window and looked on broad gravel and grass, sloping toward a little brook that entered the pool. The top of a <b>low,</b> black <b>cabinet,</b> the old oak table, the chairs in tawny leather, were littered with the children's toys, books and garden garments, at which a maternal lady in pastel looked down from the walls with smiling indulgence. The children were all there. The three girls, seated round their mother near the widow, were miniature portraits of her--dark-eyed, delicate-featured brunettes with a rich bloom on their cheeks, their little nostrils and eyebrows singularly finished {{as if they were}} tiny women, the eldest being barely nine. The boy was seated on the carpet at some distance, bending his blonde head over the animals from a Noah's ark, admonishing them separately in a voice of threatening command, and occasionally licking the spotted ones to see if the colors would hold. Josephine, the eldest, was having her French lesson; and the others, with their dolls on their laps, sat demurely enough for images of the Madonna. Mrs. Glasher's toilet had been made very carefully--each day now she said to herself that Grandcourt might come in. Her head, which, spite of emaciation, had an ineffaceable beauty in the fine profile, crisp curves of hair, and clearly-marked eyebrows, rose impressively above her bronze-colored silk and velvet, and the gold necklace which Grandcourt had first clasped round her neck years ago. Not that she had any pleasure in her toilet; her chief thought of herself seen in the glass was, [...] "How changed!"--but such good in life as remained to her she would keep. If her chief wish were fulfilled, she could imagine herself getting the comeliness of a matron fit for the highest rank. The little faces beside her, almost exact reductions of her own, seemed to tell of the blooming curves which had once been where now was sunken pallor. But the children kissed the pale cheeks and never found them deficient. That love was now the one end of her life.|$|R
40|$|Vertical display {{cabinets}} are {{widespread in}} food stores, {{because they have}} a large display area and an ease access for customers. Recently, open cabinets has been replaced with closed ones in order to reduce energy consumptions for refrigeration. However, the presence of the glass doors can have an effect on product visibility because of mist formation on the glass, particularly for <b>low</b> temperature display <b>cabinets.</b> This effect appears when the temperature at the external surface of the glass falls below the ambient dew temperature, which is a quite common situation in humid climate in the mid-season, when neither indoor air heating nor cooling is performed. Today the mist formation is prevented increasing the surface temperature at external side of the glass doors by means of electrical resistances embedded in the doors frame. The glass door surface temperature can be raised enhancing the heat transfer coefficient driving the supply air towards the display cabinet doors. This paper investigates the behaviour of different air ceiling diffusers (vortex diffusers and linear diffusers) {{in order to reduce the}} risk of mist formation and the energy consumption of electrical resistances. Initially, 3 D numerical simulations of isothermal airflow field has been performed and, later, summer and winter conditions were considered. The air flow field in the display zone, the temperature distribution on the glass surfaces and the influence of different diffusers on customers comfort condition are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{customers}} of refrigerators and freezers {{have become more}} exigent in respect to the acoustic comfort of these home appliances. Among the noise sources, there are the refrigerant flow, the fans and the compressors. The compressors might be responsible for {{a part of the}} <b>cabinet</b> <b>low</b> frequency noise which could be generated either by the gas pulsation that excites the tubing or the compressor low frequency vibration that transfers energy to the cabinet base plate and tubing. The compressor low frequency vibration {{is a function of the}} mechanism loads and the gas pressure that acts on the piston and it is modulated by its running frequency and harmonics. Besides, at low frequencies, the compressor behaves as a rigid body assembled on isolators or grommets which link the compressor to the cabinet base plate. If one knows these rigid body natural frequencies, itâ€™s possible to optimize the refrigerator project, providing a better acoustic performance for manufacturers and final customers. Based on this context, this paper aims to present a study of the compressor grommets, usually made in rubber. First of all, an investigation about the materials is carried out using a technique with a single degree-of-freedom system. In a second time, an analysis of the static behavior of an isolator using the rubber properties is done. Finally, a numerical model to predict the modal behavior of a compressor assembled on a rigid base is created and validated experimentally...|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} {{features}} which made this product unique: the GP11 pre-amp featured 11 graphic EQ bands which were very broad bands, overlapping each other, thereby enabling {{massive amounts of}} frequency cut or boost when adjacent bands were boosted or cut. Secondly, the frequency bands were spaced closer together towards the bass end allowing even more variation for bass guitarists to alter their sound like no other amp had previously allowed. Added to this were MOSFET poweramps of 250 or 500 watts and the option of bi-amplified systems where bass and upper frequencies are filtered before being separately amplified and fed to dedicated high frequency and <b>low</b> frequency speaker <b>cabinets.</b> Trace Elliot, as the brand came to be called, gained a reputation for themselves; {{rumor has it that}} early users were John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin and Brian Helicopter of punk band The Shapes. Mark King of Level 42 was also an early adopter of the brand. The company, now dedicated to manufacturing, moved to new premises in Witham, Essex, in 1985 to satisfy the growing demand.In late 1986, Stuart Watson, technical director and designer of the Trace Elliot range up to the Mark 5 series, left the company. That same year Fred Friedlein (then sole owner of Trace Elliot) employed the services of freelance electronics designer Clive Button. In 1989, Trace Elliot introduced the Trace Acoustic range of acoustic amplifiers (also designed by Clive Button), and the company moved again, this time to Maldon, Essex. In 1992 the company was bought by Kaman, which had previously handled the brand's US distribution.|$|R
