25|$|After the hakafot and the dancing, three scrolls of the Torah are read. The last parashah of the Torah, V'Zot HaBerachah, {{at the end}} of Deuteronomy (33:1–34:12), is {{read from}} the first scroll, {{followed}} immediately by the first chapter (and part of the second) of the Book of Genesis (1:1–2:3), which is read from the second scroll. It is a Jewish custom that a new beginning must immediately follow a completion, therefore it is <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> immediately read Gen. 1 after finishing Deuteronomy.|$|E

Although it may appear <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, to apply, it actually produces a circular argument: the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae.|$|E

25|$|These {{dates are}} {{allegedly}} the king's birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct {{evidence to support}} this. It is <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> assume, however, that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. In fact, according to calculations {{made on the basis}} of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty.|$|E

25|$|After {{identifying}} the applicable threats, impact scenarios {{are considered to}} support {{the development of a}} business recovery plan. Business continuity testing plans may document scenarios for each identified threats and impact scenarios. More localized impact scenarios – for example loss of a specific floor in a building – may also be documented. The BC plans should reflect the requirements to recover the business in the widest possible damage. The risk assessment should cater to developing impact scenarios that are applicable to the business or the premises it operates. For example, it might not be <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> consider tsunami in the region of Mideast since the likelihood of such a threat is negligible.|$|E
25|$|The FCC model {{predicts the}} {{specific}} form of reverse dominance display needed by female coalitions resisting would-be dominant or philanderer males. Females needed to signal 'No' by constructing themselves as inviolable using red cosmetics. To assert ritual power, {{they needed to}} go periodically on 'sex strike'. To defend themselves physically against harassment by non-kin males, defiant females needed {{to draw on the}} support of male kin—sons and brothers—as members of their reverse dominance coalitions. In order to reverse signals of sexual availability, it was <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> sing and dance an unmistakable message: 'Wrong species, wrong sex, wrong time!'. On this basis, FCC theory leads us to expect 'divine' or 'totemic' spiritual entities depicted in early rock art to be therianthropic ('wrong species'), gender-ambivalent ('wrong sex') and blood-red ('wrong time') (figure h).|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 1994, the Green Line {{closed for}} the largest transit {{rehabilitation}} project in the city's history. The Green Line reopened on May 12, 1996, {{with much of the}} renewal work completed and {{with the exception of a}} few stations. Six stations were closed indefinitely following the rehabilitation project, which angered many commuters who depend on the Green Line. In September 1997, after political pressure brought on by community leaders, the Jackson Park branch was shortened again from University to Cottage Grove after previous attempts by the City, CTA and other agencies to extend the route eastward to Dorchester, immediately west of the Illinois Central Railroad. This had seemed <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> the Dorchester Terminal, due to the fact that the Metra Electric District and South Shore Line both share a station along the IC ROW, at 63rd Street.|$|E

25|$|Hitler {{had issued}} orders that the Siegfried Line {{was to be}} held at all costs. The rapid Allied {{penetration}} of the border fortifications had disrupted German communications, command structure, and their entire defense of {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. It would have been <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> fall back to the east side of the Rhine and regroup, but Hitler absolutely refused to allow a retreat and irrationally demanded that his Army recapture the territory it had lost. Units that were threatened with the possibility of being overrun or surrounded could not fall back to a more defensible position. To protect themselves from Hitler's wrath, a court-martial and a firing squad, commanders falsified reports to cover actual losses. To shift the blame to someone else, they issued orders that could not be realistically fulfilled. The German troops, thoroughly routed by the beating they had been receiving, could not hold on to the area they controlled, much less retake ground. As a result, the Americans advanced even more rapidly towards the Rhine. An unintended consequence was that German forces paid less attention to the bridges across the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of a matrix {{is the first step}} when preparing samples for MALDI analysis. The primary goals of the matrix are to absorb the energy from a laser, thus transferring it to the analyte molecules, and to separate the analyte molecules from each other. A consideration that should be taken into account when choosing a matrix is what type of analyte ion is expected or desired. Knowing the acidity or basicity of the analyte molecule compared with the acidity or basicity of the matrix, for example, is valuable knowledge when choosing a matrix. The matrix should not compete with the analyte molecule, so the matrix should not want to form the same type of ion as the analyte. For example, if the desired analyte has a high amount of acidity, it would be <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> choose a matrix with a high amount of basicity to avoid competition and facilitate the formation of an ion. The pH of the matrix {{can also be used to}} select what sample you want to obtain spectra for. For example, in the case of proteins, a very acidic pH can show very little of the peptide components, but can show very good signal for those components that are larger. If the pH is increased towards a more basic pH, then smaller components become easier to see.|$|E

500|$|Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is {{currently}} impossible to prove or disprove. [...] Both Redford's and Murnane's {{works on the}} subject are undecided {{on the grounds that}} there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would have made no difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E

When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it.

In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac.

500|$|In the {{execution}} scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates {{the two parts}} of act1 in Wagner's Parsifal. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] is played tutta forze (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, [...] "Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams {{the first thing that}} comes into its head." [...] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: [...] "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{negative}} {{impacts of the}} potential direct and indirect effect of land use changes on carbon emissions, the study commissioned by the Dutch government concluded that [...] "it {{is very difficult to}} determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production (i.e. sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops, which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures, which in turn may cause deforestation), and also not <b>logical</b> <b>to</b> attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane". The Brazilian agency Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops. Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned pasture lands, as it has been the historical trend in São Paulo state. Also, productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research, genetic improvement, and better agronomic practices, thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures.|$|E
