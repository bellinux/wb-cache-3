5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle {{was used as a}} convalescent home for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E

5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either <b>left</b> <b>empty,</b> or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|After {{a search}} {{that had taken}} several years, Wheeler was able to secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. <b>Left</b> <b>empty</b> since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers {{made it clear that}} the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E
40|$|The delayed {{upstroke}} of the arterial {{pulse in}} valvular aortic stenosis has been attributed, in part, to prolonged <b>left</b> ventricular <b>emptying.</b> <b>Left</b> ventricular <b>emptying</b> rate, however, {{has not been}} measured in aortic stenosis. We assessed the rate of <b>left</b> ventricular <b>emptying</b> by computer analysis of biplane cineangiograms in seven normal subjects, six patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis, and 12 patients with severe aortic stenosis. As an indicator of delayed arterial pulse rise, T time index (time to half maximum aortic pressure corrected for heart rate) was measured in each group. T time index averaged 0. 07 +/- 0. 01 units in normal subjects, 0. 14 +/- 0. 04 units in the patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis, and 0. 13 +/- 0. 05 units in those with severe aortic stenosis. Patients with mild to moderate and severe aortic stenosis differed significantly from normal subjects. Relative emptying rates were defined {{as the percentage of}} initial systolic volume ejected divided by the percentage of systole elapsed. These relative emptying rates were determined during the first, second, and third thirds of systole in all three groups. No significant decrease in the relative rate of <b>left</b> ventricular <b>emptying</b> was noted when each group of patients with aortic stenosis was compared with the normal subjects. Neither was there slowing in the actual rate of ejection of blood in ml per second throughout systole. We conclude that the rate of ventricular emptying is normal in aortic stenosis and does not explain the arterial pulse delay in this disease...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Most paleontologists regard birds as {{the only}} {{surviving}} dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A {{small fraction of the}} Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction {{as a result of their}} abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The west range at Netley {{is small}} and does not run {{the full length of}} {{the west side of the}} cloister. It is divided in two by the {{original}} main entrance to the abbey, with an outer parlour where the monks could meet visitors. North of this on the ground floor were cellars for food storage, and to the south was the lay brothers' refectory. The upper floor, reached by a stair from the cloister, was the dormitory for the lay brothers. Netley was a late foundation, built at a time when the lay brothers were a declining part of the Cistercian economy, and it is probable that they were fewer in number, hence the small size of the accommodation needed. By the time the west range was completed in the fourteenth century they were rapidly disappearing, and had all but vanished by the end of the century. During the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries most Cistercian houses took advantage of the large area of the monastery then <b>left</b> <b>empty</b> and converted the lay brothers' quarters to new uses. At some houses, such as Sawley Abbey, a series of comfortable chambers for the use of monastic officials or guests were built; elsewhere, such as Hailes Abbey, the west range was turned into a private dwelling of great elegance for the abbot. The ruins of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be sure of their purpose in the latter part of the medieval period.|$|E
40|$|Several noninvasive techniques, {{including}} radionuclide angiography and Doppler echocardiography, {{have attempted}} to measure the regurgitant volume in patients with mitral regurgitation; however, none of these techniques are entirely satisfactory. Utilizing a computerized light pen method for tracing the left atrial endocardial border during systole and diastole in two orthogonal planes (apical four and two chamber views), biplane volume determinations were calculated in 12 normal subjects and 30 patients with nonrheumatic mitral regurgitation. <b>Left</b> atrial <b>emptying</b> volume determinations were performed by subtracting the left atrial end-diastolic volume from the left atrial end-systolic volume. The degree of mitral regurgitation was visually assessed as normal (0, trivial, Group I, 12 patients), mild (1 +, Group II, 4 patients), moderate (2 +, Group III, 8 patients), moderately severe (3 +, Group IV, 12 patients) and severe (4 +, Group V, 6 patients) by contrast left ventricular angiography and also quantitatively by regurgitant fraction at cardiac catheterization. All 18 patients with moderately severe (Group IV) and severe (Group V) mitral regurgitation had a <b>left</b> atrial <b>emptying</b> volume greater than 40 ml compared {{with none of the}} normal subjects and patients with mild (Group II) or moderate (Group III) mitral regurgitation. There was good correlation between <b>left</b> atrial <b>emptying</b> volume and mitral regurgitant fraction (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 01). Thus, in patients with nonrheumatic mitral regurgitation, <b>left</b> atrial <b>emptying</b> volume is useful in separating mild from severe mitral regurgitation...|$|R
