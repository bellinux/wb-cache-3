40|$|Magnetoreception of the light-dependent {{magnetic}} compass in birds is suggested to be mediated by a radical-pair mechanism {{taking place in}} the avian retina. Biophysical models on magnetic field effects on radical pairs generally assume that the light activating the magnetoreceptor molecules is nondirectional and unpolarized, and that light absorption is isotropic. However, natural skylight enters the avian retina unidirectionally, through the cornea and the lens, and is often partially polarized. In addition, cryptochromes, the putative magnetoreceptor molecules, absorb light anisotropically, i. e., they preferentially absorb light of a specific direction and polarization, implying that the light-dependent {{magnetic compass}} is intrinsically polarization sensitive. To test putative interactions between the avian magnetic compass and polarized light, we developed a spatial orientation assay and trained zebra finches to magnetic and/or overhead polarized light cues in a four-arm "plus" maze. The birds did not use overhead polarized light near the zenith for sky compass orientation. Instead, overhead polarized light modulated light-dependent magnetic compass orientation, i. e., how the birds perceive the magnetic field. Birds were well oriented when tested with the polarized <b>light</b> <b>axis</b> aligned parallel to the magnetic field. When the polarized <b>light</b> <b>axis</b> was aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the birds became disoriented. These findings are the first behavioral evidence to our knowledge for a direct interaction between polarized light and the light-dependent magnetic compass in an animal. They reveal a fundamentally new property of the radical pair-based magnetoreceptor with key implications for how birds and other animals perceive the Earth's magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|A new ultraprecise {{profiler}} {{has been}} developed to measure, for example, asymmetric and aspheric profiles. The principle of our measuring method is that the normal vector at each point on the surface is determined by making the incident light beam on the mirror surface and the reflected beam at that point of coincident. The gradient at each point is calculated from the normal vector, and the surface profile is then obtained by integrating the gradients. The measuring instrument was designed {{in accordance with the}} above principle.

The CDAD {{is derived from}} the analysis of the complete molecular frame angular distribution (MFPAD) I(χ,θ e,φ e), where χ is the orientation of the molecule with respect to the <b>light</b> propagation <b>axis</b> and (θ e,φ e) the electron emission direction in the MF, using the vector correlation method. The CDAD is quantified by the θ e dependence of the left-right emission asymmetry maximum in the plane perpendicular to the <b>light</b> propagation <b>axis</b> k, for a space fixed molecule orthogonal to k. The experimental results for selected valence shell photoionization (PI) reactions in NO, O 2, N 2 O compare very well with the multichannel Schwinger configuration interaction (MCSCI) ab initio calculations.

However, {{because of the}} nature of the LANDSAT orbit, there are almost no lineaments in the same direction as the sun angle. In this report, a new technique which can generate virtual LANDSAT images with any sun directions is described. In order to eliminate shadows from the original LANDSAT image, a shadow-free land cover classification was first applied. Shadow areas were classified into four categories using spectral features. Pixel values in each categories of the original image were scaled to the values of corresponding categories in no-shadow areas, by coinciding the mean and standard deviation of each spectral bands. Next, a three-dimensional model of the object area was constructed from the National Land Information Data Base. Assuming a specific sun elevation and azimuth, the shadowed areas can be calculated from this model. A cosine correction was made using the angle between the sun <b>light</b> <b>axis</b> and the plane direction. In addition, reflective intensities were calculated according to a three dimensional reflective model. An artificially shadowed LANDSAT image with specific sun angle was thus obtained. For lineament extraction, a sun azimuth was selected perpendicular to the real sun azimuth. A complete set of lineaments was obtained by combining the two results extracted from these two images. Furthermore, the influence of sun elevation on lineament enhancements is also discussed. In conclusion, a technique to generate a virtual LANDSAT image with illumination at any sun angle was established. with the aid of this virtual image, lineament extraction becomes more complete...|$|R

40|$|Information {{exchange}} between neural systems {{occurs at the}} level of populations of neurons. Thus in order to understand how this information exchange occurs, it is indispensible to understand the role of underlying neuronal systems. Electrophysiological techniques have enhanced our understanding of the nervous system by enabling the study of properties of single ion channels to that of ensembles of neurons. While electrophysiological measurements offer excellent temporal resolution, they lack spatial resolution as this method provides a readout of the electrical signals from single or ensembles of neurons {{in the vicinity of the}} electrodes (Scanziani et al, 2009). Imaging techniques have gained a lot of prominence because they are non-invasive and provides excellent spatial resolution (Scanziani et al, 2009). The advent of fluorescent genetically encoded optical probes and other fluorescent synthetic indicators has enabled the study of network functions of neurons (Handel et al, 2008). There are various imaging techniques but the one most suited to study network activity is Multiphoton emission (MPE) microscopy because of its ability to image at greater depths in the tissue.

40|$|Despite teleosts {{being the}} largest and most diverse group of vertebrates, fish models {{currently}} used to study photoperiodic effects on fish physiology have been limited to a few species, most of which are temperate seasonal breeders. The overall aim of this work was to expand our knowledge on circadian biology and environmental physiological effects in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus), a continuous breeding species of tropical-subtropical origin. The circadian <b>light</b> <b>axis</b> of Nile tilapia is described with regards to melatonin production. Circadian melatonin profiles of fish under 12 L: 12 D photoperiods were observed to be low at day and high at night, suggesting melatonin to be an entraining signal as observed in all other vertebrates. When constant light (LL) was used, such day and night fluctuations where abolished. However when fish where exposed to constant darkness (DD) a strong robust endogenous melatonin rhythm was found, suggesting the presence of circadian oscillators in this species. Importantly, this endogenous rhythm was observed to be maintained for at least three weeks under darkness and proved to be circadian in nature. Moreover, although the melatonin system was able to produce day and night melatonin rhythms when exposed to a different (6 L: 6 D) photocycle, the oscillator appeared to not be entrainable to such a short photo cycle when exposed to DD, as melatonin levels remained high. When comparing the circadian organization of different teleost species including Nile tilapia, preliminary studies showed at least three divergent circadian light organizations in teleosts. Nile tilapia was characterised by a pineal gland far less sensitive than in other fish species as demonstrated through in vitro studies. Furthermore, pineal melatonin production was clearly dependent on the light perceived by the eyes as ophthalmectomy resulted in basal plasma melatonin levels during the dark period. These findings are the first to be reported in a teleost and could be comparable to the circadian light organization of higher vertebrates such as mammals. The onset of puberty of Nile tilapia was studied with regards to the newly discovered Kiss 1 /GPR 54 system. Such a system has recently been discovered in mammals and found to be the primary switch of the brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis. The results of this study not only suggest a link between the Kiss 1 /GPR 54 system and the onset of III puberty in this tropical batch spawning teleost, that would be a highly conserved feature across vertebrates, but also that the transcriptional mechanisms regulating GPR 54 expression could be directly or indirectly influenced by light. Finally, a study was conducted on the effects of different intensities of continuous light (LL) on the growth and sexual development of Nile tilapia up to first maturation. The results showed a significant growth response of fish in all LL treatments compared to control fish. Importantly, this confirmed that LL enhances growth in this species and suggests that it is the light regime more than the intensity which is having an effect. This work thus provides important basic knowledge of the light entrainment pathway and circadian melatonin rhythms in Nile tilapia. Of special importance is the discovery of a strong endogenous melatonin oscillator and a novel circadian organization in fish which would seem to be homologous to that observed in higher vertebrates. Moreover, this work provides evidence that the newly discovered Kiss 1 /GPR 54 system has a similar role in fish as has been found in mammals and that such a system could be directly or indirectly regulated by light. If so, Nile tilapia and other fish species could become important models in the chronobiology and reproduction fields. Finally, this work not only increases our basic and applied knowledge of this species, but also broadens our understanding of the circadian <b>light</b> <b>axis</b> in teleosts and its mediatory effects on reproduction...|$|R

Although measurement of such ultrafast pulse width is crucial, no methods applicable to hard X-rays are currently available. In this report, we show that intensity interferometry, which is a technique initially developed by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss [1] and recently extended to the X-ray region [2, 3], is capable of measuring X-ray pulse width (32 ps in FWHM) at SPring- 8 [4]. Notably, the method can be easily extended to fs region by using simpler monochromators. Most hard X-ray sources that are either currently available or under development, including self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) free electron laser (FEL) in the linear regime, are Fig. 1. Schematic view of the experimental setup. Undulator radiation is premonochromatized with a Si 111 double crystal monochromator (DCM).

Two semi-transparent avalanche photo diodes (APDs) were aligned in tandem on the <b>light</b> <b>axis.</b> Outputs of the detectors were connected to the coincidence circuit. considered to generate chaotic light.

In both cells, in the presence of different intensities of background illumination, the slope of the intensity–response curve is maintained as the curve moves along the <b>light</b> intensity <b>axis.</b> Adaptation is relatively slo...|$|R

This paper proposes a prospective {{view of how}} the Web 2. 0 {{can be used in}} the context of e-democracy. After a review of both concepts, the main perceptions of internet users concerning their political activity on the internet are highlighted by an online survey realised in January–March 2007. Various Web 2. 0 applications are then discussed in the <b>light</b> of VEDELs <b>axis</b> – information, discussion and decision-making – in order to identify how they may enhance the implication of citizens in the political process through the internet. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
