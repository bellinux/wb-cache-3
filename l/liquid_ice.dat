As a <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>ice</b> cream parlor, Lab Made makes use of the super cold liquid nitrogen, minus 196℃, to freeze its ice cream.

Thus, it gives off a much smoother texture. The company was founded in 2012 and owned by Ronnie Cheng Hong-wang and Jennifer Chiu, who first fell in love with <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>ice</b> cream when they tasted it in England. Captivated by this dessert, the couple returned home, to Hong Kong, and introduced this treat to the city.

40|$|In certain circumstances, millimeter-wavelength Doppler radar {{velocity}} spectra {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the microphysical composition of both phases of mixed-phase clouds. This distinction is possible when the cloud properties are such that they produce a bimodal Doppler velocity spectrum. Under these conditions, the Doppler spectrum moments of the distinct <b>liquid</b> and <b>ice</b> spectral modes may be computed independently and used to quantitatively derive properties of the <b>liquid</b> droplet and <b>ice</b> particle size distributions. Additionally, the cloud liquid spectral mode, which is a tracer for clear-air motions, {{can be used to}} estimate the vertical air motion and to correct estimates of ice particle fall speeds.

The case of interest occurred on 29 July 2002 when a supercooled liquid cloud layer based at 5 km AGL and precipitating ice crystals advected over a ground measurement site. Ground-based measurements from both 35 - and 94 -GHz radars revealed clear bimodal Doppler velocity spectra within this cloud layer.

In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, pumpable ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the grapes. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the pumpable ice machine. The juice is pumped through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat concentrated juice. <b>Liquid</b> <b>ice</b> returns to the accumulation tank, {{in which there is a}} natural (according to Archimedes law) separation of ice and juice.

5000|$|The {{existence}} of frigorigic mixtures {{can be viewed}} as a consequence of the Gibbs phase rule, which describes the relationship at equilibrium between the number of components, the number of coexisting phases, and the number of degrees of freedom permitted by the conditions of heterogeneous equilibrium. Specifically, at constant atmospheric pressure, in a system containing [...] linearly independent chemical components, if +1 phases are specified to be present in equilibrium, then the system is fully determined (there are no degrees of freedom). That is, the temperature and the compositions of all phases are determined. Thus, in for example the chemical system H2O-NaCl, which has two components, the simultaneous presence of the three phases <b>liquid,</b> <b>ice,</b> and hydrohalite can only exist at atmospheric pressure at the unique temperature of -21.2 °C. The approach to equilibrium of a frigorific mixture involves spontaneous temperature change driven by the conversion of latent heat into sensible heat as the phase proportions adjust to accommodate the decrease in thermodynamic potential associated with the approach to equilibrium.|$|E
