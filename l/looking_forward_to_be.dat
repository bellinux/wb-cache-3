6000|$|... ... Thank you {{for your}} welcome letter, so kind in its candour, I angry that you should prefer 'The Seraphim'! Angry? No indeed, indeed, I am {{grateful}} for 'The Seraphim,' and not exacting for the 'Drama,' and all the more because of a secret obstinate persuasion that the 'Drama' will have a majority of friends in the end, and perhaps deserve to have them. Nay, why should I throw perhapses over my own impressions, and be insincere to you who have honoured me by being sincere? Why should I dissemble my own belief that the 'Drama' is worth two or three 'Seraphims'--my own belief, you know, which is worth nothing, writers knowing themselves so superficially, and having such a natural leaning to their last work. Still, I may say honestly to you, that I have a far more modest value for 'The Seraphim' than your kindness suggests, and that I have seemed to myself {{to have a clear}} insight into the fact that that poem was only borne up by the minor poems published with it, from immediate destruction. There is a want of unity in it which vexes me to think of, and the other faults magnify themselves day by day, more and more, in my eyes. Therefore it is not that I care more for the 'Drama,' but I care less for 'The Seraphim.' Both poems fall short of my aspiration and desire, but the 'Drama' seems to me fuller, freer and stronger, and worth the other three times over. If it has anything new, I think it must be something new into which I have lived, for certainly I wrote it sincerely and from an inner impulse. In fact, I never wrote any poem with so much sense of pleasure in the composition, and so rapidly, with continuous flow--from fifty to a hundred lines a day, and quite in a glow of pleasure and impulse all through. Still, you have not been used to see me in blank verse, and there may be something in that. That the poem is full of faults and imperfections I do not in the least doubt. I have vibrated between exultations and despondencies in the correcting and printing of it, though the composition went smoothly to an end, and I am prepared to receive the bastinado to the critical degree, I do assure you. The few opinions I have yet had are all to the effect that my advance on the former publication is very great and obvious, but then I am aware that people who thought exactly the contrary would be naturally backward in giving me their opinion.... Indeed, I thank you most earnestly. Truth and kindness, how rarely do they come together! I am very grateful to you. It is curious that 'Duchess May' is not a favorite of mine, and that I have sighed one or two secret wishes towards its extirpation, but other writers besides yourself have singled it out for praise in private letters to me. There has been no printed review yet, I believe; and when I think of them, I try to think of something else, for with no private friends among the critical body (not that I should desire to owe security in such a matter to private friendship) it is awful enough, this <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reviewed. Never mind, the ultimate prosperity of the book lies far above the critics, and can neither be mended nor made nor unmade by them.|$|E

50|$|Burke first {{appeared}} on reality television when she took part in Star for a Night. By doing that, she became the youngest person who was competing within the competition. Burke became the runner-up of the show and was beaten to the winner's title by Joss Stone. She later went on to audition for the second series of The X Factor where she {{made it all the}} way to the judges houses stage before mentor Louis Walsh decided she was too young to continue in the competition. She later returned in series five, was assigned Cheryl Cole as her mentor, and went on to win the competition, with 58% of the views votes. Burke returned to reality television on BBC One when she assigned as a guest judge on So You Think You Can Dance UK, a first for any The X Factor contestant as she was the first to have a judging role. Burke featured as a guest judge throughout a number of the Auditions and Choreography camp stages. It was revealed that BBC producers decided to cast Burke in as she had a big fanbase and the show's rating's were poor, in order to gain more views they asked Burke to become a guest judge. She later returned to The X Factor as a judge during series eight live finals. She took the place on the seat alongside, Burke's former series two mentor Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos. Burke was said to be really <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seeing what it's like to be on the otherside of the show, meaning what it will be like as a judge and not a contestant.|$|E
40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War was {{followed}} by a period of euphoric romanticism in Russia over its future relationship with Europe and the United States. Russians enthusiastically embraced the end of hostility and were <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted on equal terms in Europe. The situation changed when the country failed to utilize peace dividends and the economy suffered a serious breakdown. The Russian political elite expressed concerns that this policy was the Euro-Atlantic community's attempt to underscore the dimension of Russian humiliation and to further limit Russian influence in the international arena. Russia adamantly opposed NATO advancement to the territory of the former USSR; by exploiting this hard stance Moscow, indeed, provided NATO aspirants with arguments to join the Alliance. There is a tendency in Russia to view its relationship with NATO through the prism of the U. S. dominant role in the Alliance. This perception explains why Moscow tries to assert its position by focusing on a big power dialogue. Russian leaders attitudes toward NATO enlargement are strongly tied to their estimates of the strength of the country and their influence in the international arena...|$|E
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the patient's {{post-operative}} condition after a total hip replacement of the left. My patient during my study underwent an elective surgery for a long-term hip pain caused by coxarthritis which was unresponsive to conservative treatment. She has undergone the same surgery on the right hip. I visited the patient during the second postoperative day, she lay in the standard inpatient department and felt reasonably to her condition. She was glad that the operation was managed without complications and was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-sufficient again. The work is divided into a clinical and a nursing part. In the clinical section, we became familiar with the physiology in more detail, with a notion of total joint replacement and with reasons for this implementation. For the processing of the case study I used the most important information found by a physician during the reception of the patient. In the nursing theory are described the Marjory Gordon's nursing model and nursing process. According that I worked up the anamnesis - the information are obtained from the patient during the interview. The anamnesis helped to me to establish nursing diagnoses, the current ones and the potential ones. Based on the patient's current state of needs I set short and long-term care plan...|$|E

30|$|Moore's law has {{predicted}} {{that the number of}} transistors, which are placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit, doubles approximately every 2 years. This trend is expected to be maintained until at least 2020. Nowadays, 65 -nm technology node of the most advanced microprocessors in production has transistor gate lengths of 35 nm, which is <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 22 nm in 2016 [1, 2]. However, the inherent scaling limitations of electron devices bring many technical challenges from traditional work mode, i.e., material and basic device physics; therefore, researchers should promptly overcome or improve some of these challenges with various research breakthroughs. Ultrathin III-V compound semiconductor film growth on Si-based substrate has attracted significant attention because of the combination of the high mobility of III-V semiconductors and the well established, low-cost processing of Si technology. Paralleling with silicon-on-insulator technology, XOI was used to represent compound semiconductor-on-insulator platform [3 – 6]. Semiconductor NCs provide size-tunable optical and electrical properties, based on quantum confinement of charge carriers within them, high surface-to-volume ratios, and other attributes that have {{led to the development of}} a new generation of materials and devices [7 – 10]. Because of their various unique properties, there has been considerable interest in the synthesis of high-quality III-V compound NCs [11, 12]. InSb has the smallest effective mass, the narrowest bandgap, and the highest intrinsic electron mobility of III-V semiconductors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{my paper}} is {{exploring}} how image contributes on building the brand identity of specific organisations {{and how the}} meaning of the image can be resignified by the action of the players in a specific market. In particular, I will focus on the competition between three brands, Ibm, Apple, Microsoft. on the information technology market. My work is <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a continuation of the essay “Le vie du Logo” published in “Identités visuelles” by Jean Marie Floch about the visual competition between Apple and Ibm. I will use the tools of sociosemiotics, plastic and figurative analysis, screening more than 20 years of competition starting from 1984, the year in which the analysis of Jean Marie Floch ends up. The analysis will proceed on a “total look” perspective, analysing the visual existence of the brands, getting started from the logos up to the advertising visuals and commercial videos, blending semiotics tools with the anthropology reflection and marketing analysis, driving semiotic theory towards social and marketing research on positioning. My contribution will clearly identify the critical trasformations of the brands in exam (mainly in a visual perspective) underlining how these changes are progressively trasforming the shape of the market itself (for example, the Microsoft entrance on the market, the Apple crisis, the Ipod generation, the Ibm and Linux alliance [...] .), proposing a model that is explaining and summing up the relationships between all these brands in a temporal and oppositive point of view...|$|E
