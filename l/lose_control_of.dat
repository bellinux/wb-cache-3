5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, {{each with its own}} personality and methods, although they are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|Following his birth, Nemo {{develops}} a smaller right fin due to {{damage to his}} egg, which limits his swimming ability. Worried about Nemo's safety, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip. Nemo disobeys his father and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, and is captured by scuba divers. As the boat departs, a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet three Australian sharks– Bruce, Anchor and Chum– who claim to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> himself and enter a violent feeding frenzy. The pair escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea.|$|E
5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956).|$|E

5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
5|$|Itala driver Maurice Fabry {{started the}} fastest of the competitors; {{he covered the}} first {{kilometre}} in 43.4seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52minutes and 25.4seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position {{on the road and}} into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

While they are celebrating, Natasha and Ed almost kiss. Andrew asks Natasha {{to talk to a}} blogger about the app without Ed, which she thinks is wrong. When Ed learns what has happened, he accuses Natasha and Andrew of using him. Natasha tries to apologise, but Ed insists that she and Andrew pay him for his help and then they can go their separate ways. Ed and Natasha eventually make up and she asks him out on a date. Andrew reveals that an offer as been made for the app, but Natasha refuses to sell it. During a car journey to the city with her friends, Natasha learns that Andrew faked her signature to sell the app behind her back and an argument breaks out. Andrew tries to stop Natasha from calling the police and he bumps Chris' arm, causing him to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the car and crash. Natasha frees herself from the car, before pulling Ed from the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him to slide sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his driveshaft failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track to make heavy contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a five-place grid penalty for the gearbox change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — Shockwave intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army Shockwave summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead Brainstorm. Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his new friend, Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws Shockwave into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to <b>lose</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his chronal drive, setting his mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. Horrified at what he has become, Shockwave allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E
