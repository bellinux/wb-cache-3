5|$|Much of the {{electricity}} generated by Hydro-Québec Generation comes from hydroelectric dams located far from <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> such as Montreal. Of the 33,000MW of electrical power generated, over 93% of that comes from hydroelectric dams and 85% of that generation capacity comes from three hydroelectric generation centers: James Bay, Manic-Outardes, and Churchill Falls.|$|E
25|$|The great {{distance}} between generating {{sites on the}} Nelson River and <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> in southern Manitoba required the use of high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission lines to bring the energy to market. When these lines began operation as the Nelson River Bipole in 1972, they were the longest and highest-voltage direct current lines in the world. The Dorsey converter station is 26km northwest of Winnipeg, Manitoba.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, {{especially}} the southern part, has abundant wind potential {{that can be}} harnessed to generate renewable electricity. It is estimated that Ontario has an area of about 300,000km² within {{the reach of the}} transmission system {{that can be used for}} generating electricity from wind energy. This area approximates the size of Germany, which is the leading country for producing electricity from wind energy. If Ontario could intensively use wind energy like Germany, wind-based electricity would contribute up to 13% of the province's demand. Generating electricity from wind energy is considered cost-effective in southern Ontario because of closeness to transmission lines and <b>load</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E
2500|$|In {{a booklet}} {{published}} by the public relations branch of Hydro-Québec in August 1965, shortly after the commissioning of the second unit, the utility explains its decision to upgrade the plant by [...] "the urgent need to ensure extra capacity now and the advisability of creating an adequate reserve for future operations", adding {{that the role of}} the plant would change over its operating life. Cheaper to build than a hydroelectric power station and located closer to the major <b>load</b> <b>centres,</b> the plant could be used as spare capacity to supply peak-hour energy to the system, supplement hydro production in low-water years, and could come on-line during power outages or act as synchronous condensers, providing reactive power to control the voltage on the grid.|$|E
2500|$|Because of what {{happened}} in Quebec in the winter of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The De-icer is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a De-icer it is used as a Static Var Compensator, SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher amount of voltage to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the main <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E

50|$|Considered in the study, {{together}} with the increased demand, was {{the effect on the}} transmission system of the rapid advances in generator design resulting in projected power stations of 2,000-3,000 MW's installed capacity. These new stations were mostly to be sited where advantage could be taken of a surplus of cheap low-grade fuel and adequate supplies of cooling water, but these situations did not coincide with the <b>load</b> <b>centres.</b> West Burton with 4 x 500 MW machines, sited at the Nottinghamshire coalfield near the River Trent, is a typical example. These developments shifted the emphasis on the transmission system, from interconnection to the primary function of bulk power transfers from the generation areas to the <b>load</b> <b>centres,</b> such as the anticipated transfer in 1970 of some 6,000 MW from The Midlands to the Home counties.|$|E
