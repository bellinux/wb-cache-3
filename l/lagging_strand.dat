25|$|Further {{optimization}} can {{be achieved}} by designing oligos that target the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> in DNA replication because targeting the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> results in a higher frequency of recombinants. In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. This discontinuous synthesis results in the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> being more exposed which allows for easier beta-mediated annealing of the oligo to the target DNA than when compared to annealing to the leading strand.|$|E
25|$|Primase adds RNA primers {{onto the}} <b>lagging</b> <b>strand,</b> which allows {{synthesis}} of Okazaki fragments from 5' to 3'. However, primase creates RNA primers {{at a much}} lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the leading strand. DNA polymerase on the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> also has to be continually recycled to construct Okazaki fragments following RNA primers. This makes the speed of <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> synthesis much lower than that of the leading strand. To solve this, primase acts as a temporary stop signal, briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the leading strand from overtaking the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe studied {{nucleotide}} usage biases in 4 -fold degenerated {{sites of}} all the genes from leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> of 30 bacterial genomes. The level of guanine in 4 -fold degenerated sites (G 4 f) is significantly lower in genes from <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> than in genes from leading strands, probably because of the faster rates of guanine oxidation in single-stranded DNA leading to G to T transversions. The rates of cytosine deamination causing C to T transitions are also higher in <b>lagging</b> <b>strands.</b> We showed {{that the level of}} codons able to form stop-codons by the way of G to T transversions and C to T transitions is always higher than the level of codons able to form stop-codons by the way of C to A transversions and G to A transitions.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} review, we {{summarized}} current knowledge on replicative strand asymmetries in prokaryotic genomes. A cornerstone {{for the creation}} of a theory of their formation has been overviewed. According to our recent works, the probability of nonsense mutation caused by replication-associated mutational pressure is higher for genes from <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> than for genes from leading strands of both bacterial and archaeal genomes. Lower density of open reading frames in <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> can be explained by faster rates of nonsense mutations in genes situated on them. According to the asymmetries in nucleotide usage in fourfold and twofold degenerate sites, the direction of replication-associated mutational pressure for genes from <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> is usually the same as the direction of transcription-associated mutational pressure. It means that <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> should accumulate more 8 -oxo-G, uracil and 5 -formyl-uracil, respectively. In our opinion, consequences of cytosine deamination (C to T transitions) do not lead to the decrease of cytosine usage in genes from <b>lagging</b> <b>strands</b> because of the consequences of thymine oxidation (T to C transitions), while guanine oxidation (causing G to T transversions) makes the main contribution into the decrease of guanine usage in fourfold degenerate sites of genes from <b>lagging</b> <b>strands.</b> Nucleotide usage asymmetries and bias in density of coding regions can be found in archaeal genomes, although, the percent of “inversed ” asymmetries is much higher for them than for bacterial genomes. “Homogenized ” and “inversed ” replicative strand asymmetries in archaeal genomes can be used as retrospective indexes for detection of OriC translocations and large inversions...|$|R
25|$|DNA {{is always}} {{synthesized}} in the 5' to 3' direction.

In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, primase adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high processivity, while the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> is extended discontinuously from each primer forming Okazaki fragments. RNase removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps.

The divergence rate of sequences which changed their positions, with respect to the direction of replication fork movement, is not stable—sequences which have recently changed their positions are the most prone to mutation accumulation.

25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E

But a small fraction of the leading strands pass through the proximal inverted repeat, IRII. This is consistent with IRI being the functional inverted repeat in arresting the clockwise fork.

25|$|Although {{synthesis}} of the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing Okazaki fragments is about twice that required to synthesize the leading strand.

Processing of Okazaki fragments is therefore very common and crucial for DNA replication and cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|PCNA fully encircles the DNA {{template}} strand {{and must be}} loaded onto DNA at the replication fork. At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated.

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{scrutiny}} {{that has been}} directed for years at the yeast genome, relatively {{little is known about}} the impact of replication on the substitution dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30 % between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. In addition, we found a mutational asymmetry associated with the polarity of replication resulting in higher rates of substitutions toward C and A than toward G and T in leading strands (reciprocally more substitutions toward G and T in <b>lagging</b> <b>strands).</b> Such mutational asymmetries applied over long evolutionary periods should generate compositional skews between the two DNA strands. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in <b>lagging</b> <b>strands).</b> We also show that the nucleotide frequencies at mutational equilibrium predict a compositional skew at equilibrium very close to the observed skew between leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>strands,</b> suggesting that compositional equilibrium has been nearly attained in the present day genome of S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, the direction of this skew is inverted compared with the one in the human genome...|$|R

25|$|Because DNA {{polymerase}}s {{require a}} primer {{on which to}} begin DNA synthesis, polymerase α (Pol α) acts as a replicative primase. Pol α is associated with an RNA primase and this complex accomplishes the priming task by synthesizing a primer that contains a short 10 nucleotide stretch of RNA followed by 10 to 20 DNA bases. Importantly, this priming action occurs at replication initiation at origins to begin leading-strand synthesis and also at the 5' end of each Okazaki fragment on the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} implicates the supplementary role of {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA ligase I's function of joining Okazaki fragments. When the PCNA binding site on DNA ligase I is inactive, DNA ligase I's {{ability to connect}} Okazaki fragments is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes Okazaki fragments, the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA ligase I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the <b>lagging</b> <b>strand,</b> and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.|$|E
25|$|Flap {{endonuclease}} 1 (FEN1) {{is responsible}} for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5' ribonucleotide and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during <b>lagging</b> <b>strand</b> synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E
50|$|The second {{school of}} thought {{describes}} the mechanism of GC and AT skew as resulting from differential selective pressure between the leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>strands.</b> Examination of the prokaryotic genome shows a preference in third codon position for G over C and T over A.

In addition, the highly transcribed genes, such as ribosomal proteins, {{have been shown to be}} located mostly on the leading strand in bacteria. Therefore, a bias in the third-position codon choice of G over C can lead to GC skew. Additionally, some signal sequences are rich in guanine and thymine, such as chi sequences, and these sequences might have a higher frequency of occurrence in one strand compared to the other.|$|R
