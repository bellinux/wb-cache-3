40|$|For bursty sources, {{statistical}} Multiplexing in ATM networks {{leads to}} better utilization of network resources than does peak rate admission. In this dissertation we investigate several ATM admission control policies {{which are based}} on statistically multiplexing cells at the input to each link in an ATM network. The admission policies under investigation differ by whether the cells are segregated or multiplexed across service types. For the case where the services are separately multiplexed, the allocation of bandwidth for services can be either static or dynamic. In the network context, admission policies are further differentiated by the degree of multiplexing permitted among the VCs with different routes. For each of the admission policies we determine explicit expressions for the VC admission region and show how VC blocking can be obtained from a product-form expression. These admission regions involve nonlinear inequality constraints, thus generalizing the admission regions for multiservice loss networks with peak rate admission. We then apply the theory to a three-link network with three service types: voice, video conference, and <b>LAN</b> <b>interconnect</b> data. We show that Monte Carlo summation is an effective tool for computing VC blocking probabilities resulting from the different admission policies, which enables us to evaluate and compare the various admission policies. We also show that reduced load approximation can be applied to some of the admission policies to approximate VC blocking probabilities when used in conjunction with a heuristic to derive a conservative linear admission region. Using the results obtained from the numerical example as a guide, we discuss the tradeoffs between implementation complexity and VC connection performance of the various admission policies. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a reliable multicast transport protocol. The aim of the protocol is to provide a service equivalent to a sequence of reliable sequential unicasts between a client and a number of servers, whilst using the broadcast nature of some networks to reduce both the number of packets transmitted and the overall time needed to collect replies. The service interface of the protocol offers several types of service, ranging from the collection of a single reply from any one of a set of servers to the collection of all replies from all known servers. The messages may be of effectively arbitrary size, and the number of servers may be quite large. To support this service over real networks, special flow control mechanisms are used to avoid multiple replies overrunning the client, Reliable delivery is ensured using timeouts and a distributed acknowledgement scheme. The protocol is implemented over a network layer which supports multicast destination addressing and packet delivery. The behaviour of the protocol over both <b>LANs</b> and <b>LANs</b> <b>interconnected</b> by WAN lines is discussed.

The control software is inherently distributed, since {{it is based on}} <b>LANs</b> <b>interconnecting</b> several control workstations (WS) and specialized microprocessor boards (Local Control Unit, LCU). The workstation provide user interface and high level functions, while the LCUs handle real-time control. A basic layer of common software provides, on both workstations and LCUs, services for interprocess communication, synchronization among CPUs, On-Line Real Time Database, errors and alarms handling, events logging and booking of equipment for security and protection. On the workstation side, this software is based on the services given by Rtap, while on the LCUs specialized software implements all the necessary functionality with the same software interface. The On-Line Real Time Database is heavily distributed. Every unit in the system (WS or LCU) has its own hierarchical local database, where all the system parameters are stored and where real time data are collected.

Using these extensions, a set of related points can be grouped in a class. This allows extensive reuse of common database structures defining instances of the classes or using inheritance to create new specialized classes.
