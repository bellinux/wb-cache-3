60|$|Now, {{just after}} sundown, when all my work {{was over and}} I {{was on my way}} to my berth, it {{occurred}} to me that I should like an apple. I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at the helm was watching the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> and whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The Beer Luggers, which {{normally}} have the tack of the sail set {{to a small}} bowsprit where untacking it is difficult, will have the lazy sheet forward of the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> and will use it haul the whole sail around its own luff, leaving the old working but now lazy sheet again forwards around the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> or front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> {{would be}} <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to [...] "luff" [...] or shake when sailing {{too close to}} the wind; ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{downhaul}} may {{be attached}} to the boom near the gooseneck to pull the boom down and increase tension on <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> (forward edge) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> If no downhaul is present, the gooseneck is usually fixed vertically to the mast and a cunningham may be used to control luff tension.|$|R
5000|$|Like the pinas, the bedar over 45 feet (LOD), carried two masts, {{one in the}} bow, called [...] "topan", {{slightly}} raked forward; The main mast, called [...] "agung" [...] {{was placed}} a bit forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat. The bedar had a very long bowsprit, slightly bent downwards by the bobstay. Both masts carried a fully battened lug or [...] "junk-sail" [...] of typical Chinese design. These sails were not made of cloth but of a matting material called [...] "tikal" [...] that is also used for floor matting and other purposes. Like most junk <b>sails</b> <b>the</b> battens were made of bamboo, usually creating 6 individual panels to <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> <b>The</b> halyard was attached almost in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> and since <b>the</b> <b>luff,</b> or edges, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> was nearly straight and only about half <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> markedly convex leech, the yard, when hoisted, was sitting in an angle of about 15° - 20° with the vertical.|$|R
5000|$|... {{adjust the}} tension in the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> by {{adjusting}} the throat halyard, downhaul, gooseneck or any combination of these.|$|E
5000|$|... the luff hauling parrel, whose {{function}} is to tame the wrinkles in the junk sail cloth {{as a result of}} the middle battens creeping forward when the sail is trimmed. It is rigged from the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> at the batten to the mast in shoestring fashion such that when it is hauled, it will pull the middle battens aft; ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cunningham}} {{differs from}} a typical downhaul {{in the way}} that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the mast or boom below the foot of the mainsail. It is then passed through a cringle in the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> near the foot, but above the tack, and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast or boom or on deck.|$|E
5000|$|Like the symmetric, the Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} {{is often}} {{stored in a}} turtle, with the corners on top for easy access. While a symmetric spinnaker is flown with a [...] "guy" [...] and a [...] "sheet", an asymmetric spinnaker is flown with a tackline and a [...] "sheet." [...] The tack attaches to the bow or (often retractable) bowsprit, and the two sheets attach to the clew. <b>The</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> {{is attached to the}} spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> <b>The</b> sheets are passed to either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forestay, attached to the clew; they may be passed forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetric, or aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetric, between the tack line and the forestay. The sheet on the downwind (lee) side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull is used to trim <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> and <b>the</b> opposite sheet is left slack. Often a tack line is used at leading edge to provide adjustable tension on <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinnaker. To keep the tack near <b>the</b> centerline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat, it may be attached to the forestay with a sliding collar (often riding over the furled jib on parrel beads, tacker or similar device) adjustable with a down haul, or tack line [...] This allows the tack to slide up and down the forestay to adjust the luff tension. [...] On racing boats, <b>the</b> tack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetric is often rigged to a retractable bowsprit, which increases the foretriangle area and prevents interference with the jib. As this trend becomes more popular in racing boats, it may result in similar adaptations to cruising boats as well.|$|R
50|$|Some boats even carry two code zeros, usually {{referred}} to as the masthead zero (MH0) and the fractional zero (FR0). <b>The</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masthead zero will run from the tack to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast. <b>The</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractional zero will run from the tack to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forestay on a boat that is a fractional rig. This means that the FRO is usually smaller than the MHO. Sailors will often pronounce MHO as 'mo', like the slang for a mohawk and the FRO as 'fro' like the slang for an afro haircut.|$|R
6000|$|Just then {{a sort of}} {{brightness}} {{fell upon}} me in the barrel, and looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fore-sail; and almost {{at the same time}} <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lookout shouted, [...] "Land ho!" ...|$|R
50|$|Carved {{images of}} the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, {{forestay}} and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a beitass by the Norse). This was used to push the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> out into the wind.|$|E
50|$|The {{tension in}} the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is {{adjusted}} {{using a combination of}} the halyard and the cunningham (where fitted). The primary advantage of adjusting the cunningham is the speed and ease with which the luff tension can be changed while sailing or racing. By either hauling or easing the line, the {{tension in the}} luff can be changed, thereby shifting the point of maximum draft of the sail forward or aft respectively, optimizing sail shape—and therefore—performance. It is a fine control which is used more frequently on racing sailboats than on cruising or day-sailing boats.|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, luffing {{refers to}} when a sailing vessel is steered far enough toward the {{direction}} of the wind ("windward"), or the sheet controlling a sail is eased so far past optimal trim, that airflow over the surfaces of the sail is disrupted and the sail begins to [...] "flap" [...] or [...] "luff" [...] (the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is usually where this first becomes evident). This is not always done in error; for example, the sails will luff when the bow of the boat passes through {{the direction of}} the wind as the sailboat is tacked.|$|E
50|$|Bolt ropes are sewn onto <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to {{reinforce}} them, or to fix <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> foil <b>of</b> a roller-furling jib.|$|R
50|$|Stackers are {{nominally}} {{rated for}} {{capacity in tonnes}} per hour (tph). They normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard. A stacker can usually move {{in at least two}} directions: horizontally along the rail and vertically by luffing (raising and lowering) its boom. <b>Luffing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom minimises dust by reducing the distance that material such as coal needs to fall to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stockpile. The boom is luffed upwards as <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stockpile increases. Some stackers can rotate the boom. This allows a single stacker to form two stockpiles, one on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conveyor.|$|R
60|$|Herrick {{gave her}} a spoke or two in silence; his eye, as it skirted from the needle to <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foresail, passed the man by without speculation. But Huish was really dull, a thing he could support with difficulty, having no {{resources}} <b>of</b> his own. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> a private talk with Herrick, {{at this stage of}} their relations, held out particular inducements to a person of his character. Drink besides, as it renders some men hyper-sensitive, made Huish callous. And it would almost have required a blow to make him quit his purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Both masts {{carried a}} fully battened lug or [...] "Junk"-sail of typical Chinese design. These sails {{were not made}} of cloth but of a matting {{material}} called [...] "tikal" [...] that is also used for floor matting and other purposes. Like most junk sails the battens were made of bamboo, usually creating 6 individual panels to the sail. The haliard was attached almost {{in the middle of}} the yard, and since the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> was nearly straight and only about half the length of the markedly convex leach, the yard, when hoisted, was sitting in an angle of about 15° - 20° with the vertical.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> {{is bound}} to the mast, but unlike the gaff rig where the head {{is bound to}} a spar, this rig {{supports}} the leech of the sail {{by means of a}} diagonal spar or spars named a sprit. [...] The forward end of the sprit spar is attached to the mast, with the after end of the sprit spar attached to the peak. The sprit is steadied and controlled from the deck by a pair of wire vangs attached to the peak of the sail. It {{is said to be the}} ancestor from which the common gaff rig evolved in 16th-century Holland. The foot of the sail may be bent to a boom, or be loose-footed and just controlled by its sheets.|$|E
5000|$|Tell-tales {{can also}} be {{attached}} to a sail, used as a guide when trimming (adjusting) a sail. On the mainsail tell-tales may {{be placed on the}} leech (aft edge) and when trimmed properly should be streaming backwards while on a beat (upwind). When placed on the luff (forward or mast edge of the mainsail) they are used to indicate that the sail is luffing or coming head to wind. The solution is to bear away from the wind or sheet in. On the jib there may be tell-tales {{on both sides of the}} <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> As a general guide, the windward tell-tale should stream aft (backwards) with an occasional lift, the leeward front tell-tail should stream aft when on a beat to windward. If one tell-tail begins to spiral, it is indicating the sail has detached air flow on that side. To correct this the sail needs to move towards the opposite side. [...] "Tiller to tatteling tail" [...] is a good phrase to remember which direction to push the tiller when the tail is spiraling. Alternatively, the sail itself can be sheeted in or out towards the tell-tale which is not streaming.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the yard}} {{in context with}} <b>the</b> modern junk <b>sail</b> is <b>the</b> {{supporting}} spar along <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> from <b>the</b> throat and peak. The yard is a stout spar relative to the battens because it supports <b>the</b> full weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> when <b>the</b> halyard is hauled and <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is raised. It also elevates <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> when trimmed.|$|R
25|$|Patent Sails, {{invented in}} 1819 by William Cubitt, combine <b>the</b> {{shutters}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spring <b>Sail</b> with <b>the</b> automatic adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roller Reefing <b>Sail.</b> Single Patents have shutters on <b>the</b> trailing side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> Double Patents have shutters {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> for its whole length.|$|R
50|$|P <b>The</b> <b>luff</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mainsail}} measured along <b>the</b> aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom to {{the highest}} point that the mainsail can be hoisted at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast.|$|R
5000|$|The sheet is {{attached}} midway along the boom {{or at the}} free end, typically {{by means of a}} block. The block is typically attached to the boom by means of a bail, which is a U-shaped piece of metal, flattened at the ends to allow attachment with screws or rivets. In smaller boats such as dinghies it is used to control the angle of the sail to the wind on each point of sail. On largest boats this function is largely assumed by the traveller and the main sheet is used to adjust the twist of the sail to present the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to the wind all of the way up the mast. Easing the main sheet increases twist and the twist is usually adjusted so that the aft end of the top batten in the main sail runs parallel to the boom. The traveller is a track running {{from one side of the}} boat to the other upon which sits a car to which the other end of the sheet {{is attached}}. Moving the car from side to side alters the angle of the boom to the centreline of the boat while minimising the effect on the twist of the sail.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile sailing offwind, the trimmer {{typically}} {{adjusts the}} downwind sail " {{on the verge}} of luff-ing ", occasionally letting the <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> flap. Due to the unsteadiness of the spinnaker itself, maintaining the luff {{on the verge of}} luffing requires continual adjustments. The propulsive force generated by the offwind sail depends on this trimming and is highly fluctuating. During a flapping sequence, the aerodynamic load can fluctuate by 50 % of the average load. On a J/ 80 class yacht, we simultaneously measured time-resolved pressures on the spinnaker, aerodynamic loads, boat data and wind data. Significant spatio-temporal patterns were detected in the pressure distribution. In this paper we present averages and main fluctuations of pressure distributions and of load coefficients for different apparent wind angles as well as a refined analysis of pressure fluctuations, using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. POD shows that pressure fluctuations due to luffing of the spinnaker can be well represented by only one proper mode related to a unique spatial pressure pattern and a dynamic behavior evolving with the Apparent Wind Angles. The time evolution of this proper mode is highly correlated with load fluctuations. Moreover, POD can be employed to filter the measured pressures more efficiently than basic filters. The reconstruction using the first few modes makes it possible to restrict the flapping analysis to the most energetic part of the signal and remove insignificant variations and noises. This might be helpful for comparison with other measurements and numerical simulations...|$|E
50|$|The throat halyard hoists <b>the</b> throat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> (<b>the</b> end {{closer to}} the mast) at <b>the</b> forward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaff and bears <b>the</b> main weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> and <b>the</b> tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>luff.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Windshaft - A {{particularly}} important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> frame, <b>the</b> windshaft is the cylindrical piece that translates <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> into <b>the</b> machinery within the windmill.|$|R
60|$|By {{lowering}} the gaff the spanker was imperfectly bent; {{that is to}} say, it was bent on the upper leach. The boom was got in under cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane-house, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bundle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail; the out-hauler was bent, the boom, replaced, <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> being hoisted with a little and a hurried lacing, to the luff. This was not effected without a good deal <b>of</b> hazard, though <b>the</b> nearness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel to the rocks prevented most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabs from perceiving what passed so far aft. Still, others nearer to the shore caught glimpses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors, and several narrow escapes were the consequence. The second mate, in particular, had a shot through his hat {{within an inch of}} his head. By a little management, notwithstanding, <b>the</b> <b>luff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spanker was made to stand tolerably well; and the ship had at least <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> this one sail.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The leechlines {{are clearly}} visible running inwards and upwards from <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> <b>The</b> buntlines up <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> {{can be seen}} too, but their run to the blocks on the shrouds is {{obscured}} because <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is set on a lifting yard.|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar <b>sail</b> includes {{key areas}} such as structures, sail deployment, space environmental effects, materials, power systems, telemetry, communications, attitude control, thermal control, and trajectory analysis.

25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce <b>sail</b> twist in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> where <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is set at a different angle <b>of</b> attack from <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> in order to change the lift distribution with height. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> wind gradient can be factored into <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> twist in <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust <b>the</b> trim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|R
5000|$|Stock - the {{arm that}} {{protrudes}} from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> windmill holding <b>the</b> frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> in place, this is <b>the</b> main support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> {{and is usually}} made of wood.|$|R
50|$|The Spritsail {{is another}} rig with a four-sided fore-aft <b>sail.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> gaff rig where the head hangs from a spar along its edge, this rig {{supports}} <b>the</b> leech <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> by means <b>of</b> a spar named a sprit. <b>The</b> forward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sprit {{is attached to}} the mast but bisects <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> with <b>the</b> after end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sprit attaching to the peak and/or <b>the</b> clew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} Bermuda rig, <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> located in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast {{generally}} deliver {{a higher percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving force. The stay that supports <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> causes far less turbulence than a mast, resulting in better airflow across <b>the</b> lee side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> To {{take advantage of this}} fact, Bermuda rigs are shifting towards larger fore-sails and smaller mainsails. Fore-sails include jibs, genoas and staysails. The cutter, with its use of multiple foresails, achieves <b>the</b> same goal <b>of</b> placing a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> area in staysails.|$|R
50|$|Retrieving the {{asymmetric}} {{is similar}} to the process for the symmetric. The sheets are released, allowing <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to collapse to <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat. <b>The</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is then gathered, and the halyard released and <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> lowered, where it is packed into the turtle.|$|R
