40|$|In the {{research}} area of dynamic traffic assignment, <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> times {{can be derived}} from link cumulative inflow and outflow curves which are generated by dynamic network loading. In this paper, the profiles of cumulative flows are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate cumulative flows over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time models are developed. We prove that these two types of <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|R

40|$|<b>Link</b> <b>travel</b> time plays a {{significant}} role in traffic planning, traffic management and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). A public probe vehicle dataset is a probe vehicle dataset that is collected from public people or public transport. The appearance of public probe vehicle datasets can support travel time collection at a large temporal and spatial scale but at a relatively low cost. Traditionally, <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time is the aggregation of travel time by different movements. A recent study proved that <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time of different movements is significantly different from their aggregation. However, there is still not a complete framework for estimating movement-based <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time. In addition, probe vehicle datasets usually have a low penetration rate but no previous study has solved this problem. To solve the problems above, this study proposed a detailed framework to estimate movement-based <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time using a high sampling rate public probe vehicle dataset. Our study proposed a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression method to increase travel time samples using incomplete trajectory. An incomplete trajectory was compared with historical complete trajectories and the <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time of the incomplete trajectory was represented by its similar complete trajectories. The result of our study showed that the method can significantly increase <b>link</b> <b>travel</b> time samples but there are still limitations. In addition, our study investigated the performance of k-NN regression under different parameters and input data. The sensitivity analysis of k-NN algorithm showed that the algorithm performed differently under different parameters and input data. Our study suggests optimal parameters should be selected using a historical dataset before real-world application...|$|R
