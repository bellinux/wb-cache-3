It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan <b>Legislative</b> <b>Office</b> Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest {{building in}} the complex and was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office and Reception Room. Today it houses the offices {{of the members of the}} Pennsylvania House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|The West Virginia Legislature is bicameral. It {{consists}} of the House of Delegates and the Senate. It is a citizen's legislature, meaning that <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> is not a full-time occupation, but rather a part-time position. Consequently, the legislators often hold a full-time job in their community of residence.|$|E

He thought that, {{with the help of}} the McKinley Administration, he could win it. McKinley was assassinated and his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, {{preferred}} Dawes's opponent. In 1902, following this unsuccessful attempt at <b>legislative</b> <b>office,</b> Dawes declared that he was done with politics. He organized the Central Trust Company of Illinois, where he served as its president until 1921.|$|E

25|$|Austin was {{a member}} of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In 1978, at the age of 26, he {{defeated}} a three-term incumbent in the 39th Legislative District primary election by over a 2-1 margin. Austin received 5,116 votes to Democrat incumbent George Miscevich's 2,428. Austin went on to win the November 1978 general election with 12,055 votes to his Republican opponent's 3,196, in one of the largest pluralities in state legislative races that year. The Austin campaign emphasized door-to-door campaigning, local volunteers, and creative media advertising. Austin was an effective campaigner and burst onto the Pittsburgh political scene quickly. He was the first full-time legislator in the 39th District and the first to open and staff a <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> in the Mon Valley district.|$|E

25|$|However, many {{regulatory}} {{barriers to}} entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights {{in the face of}} rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council <b>Legislative</b> <b>Office</b> suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to protesting, ACORN also developed and strengthened its {{political action committees}} and encouraged its members to run for office. For the 1984 election ACORN wanted to endorse a candidate, setting a 75% support in polls among members as its requirement. No candidate reached that level, though there was strong support for Jesse Jackson. ACORN also established a <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> that year in Washington, DC. During this period ACORN also focused on local election reform {{in a number of}} cities, including Pittsburgh, Columbia, South Carolina, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. They encouraged cities to change legislative bodies whose members were elected at-large to electing members by single-member district, which resulted in more participation by minorities, including women. At-large voting tends to favor candidates who can appeal to the majority and who can command more campaign funding, reducing participation by a wider variety of citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Women's Indian Association (WIA) {{was founded}} in 1917. It sought votes for women {{and the right to}} hold <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> on the same basis as men. These {{positions}} were endorsed by the main political groupings, the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. British and Indian feminists combined in 1918 to publish a magazine Stri Dharma that featured international news from a feminist perspective. In 1919 in the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being monarchies). In Bengal province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.|$|E

500|$|By early 1974, the Senate had {{rejected}} nineteen government bills, ten of them twice. With a half-Senate election due by mid-year, Whitlam looked {{for ways to}} shore up support in that body. [...] Queensland senator and former DLP leader Vince Gair signalled his willingness to leave the Senate for a diplomatic post. [...] Gair's term would not expire until the following half-Senate election (or upon a double dissolution election). With five Queensland seats {{at stake in the}} half-Senate election, the ALP would probably win only two, but if six (including Gair's) were at stake, the party likely would win a third. Possible control of the Senate was therefore at stake; Whitlam agreed to Gair's request and had Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck appoint him ambassador to Ireland. Word leaked of Gair's pending resignation, and Whitlam's opponents attempted to counteract his manoeuvre. On {{what became known as the}} [...] "Night of the Long Prawns", Country Party members secreted Gair at a small party in a <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> as the ALP searched for him to secure his written resignation. As Gair enjoyed beer and prawns, Bjelke-Petersen advised the Queensland governor, Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for only the usual five vacancies, since Gair's seat was not yet vacant, effectively countering Whitlam's plan.|$|E

As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment, and instead served his sentence by doing unpaid social community work. Because he had been sentenced to a gross imprisonment for more than two years, a new Italian anti-corruption law led to the Senate expelling and barring him from serving in any <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> for six years.

2500|$|The Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism rallied against Duke's gubernatorial campaign. Beth Rickey, a {{moderate}} {{member of the}} Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a PhD student at Tulane University, began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her of his worldview: the Holocaust was a myth, notorious Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele was a medical genius, and that blacks and Jews were responsible for various social ills. [...] Rickey released transcripts of their conversations {{to the press and}} also provided evidence establishing that Duke sold Nazi literature (including Mein Kampf) from his <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> and attended neo-Nazi political gatherings while he held elective office.|$|E
2500|$|Rickey {{followed}} Duke to {{a national}} gathering in Chicago, Illinois, where she taped him making a racist remark. She released the tape and arranged for detectives to visit Duke's residence and <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> where he was found selling Nazi books. As a Republican central committee member, she introduced a resolution to censure Duke, but the move was tabled [...] because the committee has jurisdiction only over its own members, and Duke {{has never been a}} member of the state committee. The publicity generated by Rickey hurt Duke among Republican leaders and voters who questioned his Nazi ties. Signs appeared saying, [...] "Vote for the Crook. It's Important", a reference to Edwards' ethical conduct. The campaign was also known as [...] "the election from Hell."

2500|$|Local {{historians have}} {{pronounced}} the Blair–Dunning House {{the most important}} house {{in the city of}} Bloomington, except perhaps for buildings on the Indiana University campus. [...] In recognition of its status, the house was designated a historic site by the city of Bloomington on July 5, 1979. [...] This designation, which was granted in response to a request from the owners, prohibited significant modifications without permission from the city planning commission. [...] At that time, the city was considering extending Third Street through the western side of the city; this designation prevented such an extension. [...] As a result, the designation was controversial; some officials mildly opposed this designation, and others saw this opposition as a rejection of the very idea of historic preservation. [...] Four years later, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, due primarily to its status as the home of Paris Dunning, the only Indiana politician to have held every elected executive and <b>legislative</b> <b>office</b> in state government. [...] Today, the Blair–Dunning House is seen as {{the most important part of}} the Prospect Hill Historic District; added to the National Register in 1991, Prospect Hill encompasses one of Bloomington's oldest neighborhoods.|$|E
