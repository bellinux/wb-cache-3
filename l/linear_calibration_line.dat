40|$|Simultaneous {{determination}} of guanine and adenine contents in DNA, RNA and synthetic oligonucleotides an a Nafion-ruthenium oxide pyrochlore modified electrode is described. This chemically modified electrode shows very pronounced electrocatalytic effects towards the oxidation of guanine and adenine. The experimental parameters for individual determinations of guanine and adenine on the modified electrode were first optimised. Excellent detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0. 86 ng ml(- 1) (5. 7 nM) and 2. 7 ng ml(- 1) (20 nM) for guanine and adenine, respectively, were obtained. Simultaneous {{determination of}} guanine and adenine {{in a mixture}} was also optimised. The denatured calf thymus DNA and yeast RNA showed oxidation peaks corresponding to guanine and adenine with a <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> up to 5 mu g ml(- 1) in pH 4. 0 phosphate buffer. The detection limit estimated for these nucleic acids were 11. 5 ng ml(- 1) and 37. 7 ng ml(- 1) for guanine and adenine, respectively. The new method provides an alternative to estimate the guanine and adenine contents more selectively and sensitively than currently applied techniques...|$|E
40|$|An {{accelerator}} is {{an indispensable}} organic additive for the bottom-up filling of copper electroplating in nano- or micro-scale features. However, its effective concentration {{is too low}} to be easily determined and controlled. Herein, a new electrochemical analysis method based on self-assembly monolayers of thiol molecules on a gold electrode was developed to accurately determine a trace amount of accelerator. The accelerator employed in copper plating solutions is bis-(3 -sulfopropyl) disulfide (SPS), {{which is the most}} common accelerator for the filling of vias and trenches of interconnects. The SPS concentration in copper plating solutions ranged from 0. 3 to 9. 0 ppm. Following selective chemisorption of SPS onto the gold electrode, the SPS-modified gold electrode was transferred into a specific electrolyte composed of CuSO 4, H 2 SO 4, polyethylene glycol and chloride ions to run cyclic voltammetry (CV) for copper deposition and stripping. A specific peak current of copper reduction formed in the CV, and its peak area depended on the SPS concentration in the copper plating solution. A good <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> was obtained by using this electrochemical analysis method, which can determine a trace amount of SPS in a concentration range of 0. 3 - 1. 0 ppm, which is a significant challenge for traditional instruments...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling {{as an alternative}} for classical venous sampling is increasingly recognized, with multiple applications in, e. g., therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicology. Although DBS sampling has many advantages, it is associated with several issues, the hematocrit (Hct) issue being the most widely discussed challenge, given its possible strong impact on DBS-based quantitation. Hitherto, no approaches allow Hct prediction from nonvolumetrically applied DBS. Following a simple and rapid extraction protocol, K+ levels from 3 mm DBS punches were measured via indirect potentiometry, using the Roche Cobas 8000 routine chemistry analyzer. The extracts’ K+ concentrations were {{used to calculate the}} approximate Hct of the blood used to generate DBS. A <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> was established, with a Hct range of 0. 19 to 0. 63 (lower limit of quantification, LLOQ, to upper limit of quantification, ULOQ). The procedure was fully validated; the bias and imprecision of quality controls (QCs) at three Hct levels and at the LLOQ and ULOQ was less than 5 and 12 %, respectively. In addition, the influence of storage (pre- and postextraction), volume spotted, and punch homogeneity was evaluated. Application on DBS from patient samples (n = 111), followed by Bland and Altman, Passing and Bablok, and Deming regression analysis, demonstrated a good correlation between the “predicted Hct” and the “actual Hct”. After correcting for the observed bias, limits of agreement of ± 0. 049 were established. Incurred sample reanalysis demonstrated assay reproducibility. In conclusion, potassium levels in extracts from 3 mm DBS punches can be used to get a good prediction of the Hct, {{one of the most important}} “unknowns” in DBS analysis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ion trap}} mass {{spectrometer}} is a tandem-in-time instrument that has promise as an extremely sensitive device for practical tandem mass spectrometry assays. An approach for the quantitative analysis of unknown drug levels in crude extracts, using combined capillary gas chromatography and the ion trap mass spectrometer in the tandem mode, is described. One-gram plasma samples were spiked with an anti-inflammatory drug at levels of 1 – 100 ng, and with 50 ng {{of a chemical}} analog internal standard. Crude extracts of the plasma samples are analyzed by using scan functions that utilize combined radiofrequency (rf) and dc voltages. The need for combined rf- and dc-voltage sequences for analysis of such extracts is demonstrated by comparison to attempted analyses using only rf voltages. Limitations of the method are: (1) the need for accurate calibration of ionization times to obtain <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>lines,</b> and (2) the lack of automatic gain control for scans using combined rf and dc voltages to control and optimize parent ion populations and to allow a simpler analysis of “unknowns. ...|$|R
40|$|As paleoceanographic archives, {{deep sea}} coral skeletons offer the {{potential}} for high temporal resolution and precise absolute dating, but have not been fully investigated for geochemical reconstructions of past ocean conditions. Here we assess the utility of skeletal P/Ca, Ba/Ca and U/Ca in the deep sea coral D. dianthus as proxies of dissolved phosphate (remineralized at shallow depths), dissolved barium (trace element with silicate-type distribution) and carbonate ion concentrations, respectively. Measurements of these proxies in globally distributed D. dianthus specimens show clear dependence on corresponding seawater properties. Linear regression fits of mean coral Element/Ca ratios against seawater properties yield the equations: P/Cacoral (lmol/mol) = (0. 6 ± 0. 1) P/Casw(lmol/mol) – (23 ± 18), R 2 = 0. 6, n = 16 and Ba/Cacoral(lmol/mol) = (1. 4 ± 0. 3) Ba/Casw(lmol/mol) + (0 ± 2), R 2 = 0. 6, n = 17; no significant relationship is observed between the residuals of each regression and seawater temperature, salinity, pressure, pH or carbonate ion concentrations, suggesting that these variables were not significant secondary dependencies of these proxies. Four D. dianthus specimens growing at locations withOarag 6 0. 6 displayed markedly depleted P/Ca compared to the regression based on the remaining samples, a behavior attributed to an undersaturation effect. These corals {{were excluded from the}} calibration. Coral U/Ca correlates with seawater carbonate ion: U/Cacoral(lmol/mol) = (? 0. 016 ± 0. 003) ½CO 2 ? 3 ? (lmol/kg) + (3. 2 ± 0. 3), R 2 = 0. 6, n = 17. The residuals of the U/Ca calibration are not significantly related to temperature, salinity, or pressure. Scatter about the <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> is attributed to imperfect spatialtemporal matches between the selected globally distributed specimens and available water column chemical data, and potentially to unresolved additional effects. The uncertainties of these initial proxy calibration regressions predict that dissolved phosphate could be reconstructed to ± 0. 4 lmol/kg (for 1. 3 – 1. 9 lmol/kg phosphate), and dissolved Ba to ± 19 nmol/kg (for 41 – 82 nmol/kg Basw). Carbonate ion concentration derived from U/Ca has an uncertainty of ± 31 lmol/kg (for 60 – 120 lmol=kg CO 2 ? 3). The effect of microskeletal variability on P/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca was also assessed, with emphasis on centers of calcification, Fe–Mn phases, and external contaminants. Overall, the results show strong potential for reconstructing aspects of water mass mixing and biogeochemical processes in intermediate and deep waters using fossil deep-sea corals...|$|R

With GCE, {{it is possible to}} verify that the oxidative mechanism is irreversible, independent of pH, and the maximum intensity current was observed at + 1. 20 V vs. AgCl/Ag at pH 1. 9. A <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> was obtained from 1. 0 x 10 - 4 to 8. 0 x 10 - 4 mol L- 1 with SWV method. To complete the electrochemical knowledge of ETF pesticide, the reduction was also explored with HMDE. A well-defined peak was observed at – 1. 00 V vs. AgCl/Ag in a large range of pH with higher signal at pH 7. 0. Linearity was obtained in 4. 2 x 10 - 6 and 9. 4 x 10 - 6 mol L- 1 ETF concentration range. An immediate alkaline hydrolysis of ETF was executed, producing a phenolic compound (2 -ethylthiomethylphenol) (EMP), and the electrochemical activity of the product was examined. It was deduced that it is oxidized on GCE at + 0. 75 V vs. AgCl/Ag with a maximum peak intensity current at pH 3. 2, but the compound had no reduction activity on HMDE. Using the decrease of potential peak, a flow injection analysis (FIA) system was developed connected to an amperometric detector, enabling the determination of EMP over concentration range of 1. 0 x 10 - 7 and 1. 0 x 10 - 5 mol L- 1 at a sampling rate of 60 h- 1.

40|$|The {{restrictive}} {{properties of}} compositional data, that is multivariate data with positive parts that carry only relative information in their components, call for special {{care to be}} taken while performing standard statistical methods, for example, regression analysis. Among the special methods suitable for handling this problem is the total least squares procedure (TLS, orthogonal regression, regression with errors in variables, calibration problem), performed after an appropriate log-ratio transformation. The difficulty or even impossibility of deeper statistical analysis (confidence regions, hypotheses testing) using the standard TLS techniques can be overcome by calibration solution based on linear regression. This approach can be combined with standard statistical inference, for example, confidence and prediction regions and bounds, hypotheses testing, etc., suitable for interpretation of results. Here, {{we deal with the}} simplest TLS problem where we assume a linear relationship between two errorless measurements of the same object (substance, quantity). We propose an iterative algorithm for estimating the <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> and also give confidence ellipses for the location of unknown errorless results of measurement. Moreover, illustrative examples from the fields of geology, geochemistry and medicine are included.

The calcium concentration can be estimated from the measured CT number of the nodule and a CT number vs calcium concentration <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> that is derived from CT scans {{of two or more}} calcium reference standards. To account for CT number nonuniformity in the reconstruction field, such <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> may be obtained at multiple locations within lung regions in an anthropomorphic phantom. The authors performed a study to investigate the effects of patient body size, anatomic region, and calibration nodule size on the derived <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> at ten lung region positions using both single energy (SE) and dual energy (DE) CT techniques. Simulated spherical lung nodules of two concentrations (50 and 100 mg∕cc CaCO 3) were employed. Nodules of three different diameters (4. 8, 9. 5, and 16 mm) were scanned in a simulated thorax section representing the middle of the chest with large lung regions. The 4. 8 and 9. 5 mm nodules were also scanned in a section representing the upper chest with smaller lung regions. Fat rings were added to the peripheries of the phantoms to simulate larger patients. Scans were acquired on a GE-VCT scanner at 80, 120, and 140 kVp and were repeated three times for each condition. The average absolute CT number separations between the <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> were computed. In addition, under- or overestimates were determined when the <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> for one condition (e. g., small patient) were used to estimate the CaCO 3 concentrations of nodules for a different condition (e. g., large patient). The authors demonstrated that, in general, DE is a more accurate method for estimating the calcium contents of lung nodules. The DE <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> within the lung field were less affected by patient body size, calibration nodule size, and nodule position than the SE <b>calibration</b> <b>lines.</b> Under- or overestimates in CaCO 3 concentrations of nodules were also in general smaller in quantity with DE than with SE. However, because the slopes of the <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> for DE were about one-half the slopes for SE, the relative improvement in the concentration estimates for DE as compared to SE was about one-half the relative improvement in the separation between the <b>calibration</b> <b>lines.</b> Results {{in the middle of the}} chest thorax section with large lungs were nearly completely consistent with the above generalization. On the other hand, results in the upper-chest thorax section with smaller lungs and greater amounts of muscle and bone were mixed.

40|$|Regarding the {{expression}} of the reliability of measurement results, an international consensus is emerging that analytical values are expressed in combination with the uncertainty of their measurement. This paper proposes basic procedures for the estimation of uncertainty in analytical methods used for laboratory testing. There are two situations where uncertainty estimation is necessary: (1) estimation of the uncertainty of routine test values and (2) estimation of the uncertainty of assigned values of calibrators and quality assurance (QA) samples. For each of these situations, methods of uncertainty estimation are discussed in four cases: the cases where the analytical procedures are calibrated at every batch of assay, where the calibration takes place only at the first batch of assay, where multipoint <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> is performed, and where calibration is performed using a calibration curve. Key words: uncertainty of measurement, estimation method, routine test value, assigned value of calibrator and quality assurance sample, traceability, metrology, reliability, measurand, component of uncertatinty, reference material, <b>linear</b> <b>calibration,</b> nonlinear calibration, repeatability...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{photon-counting}} technique {{which provides}} direct digital read-out of data {{has been developed}} and evaluated for the reaction rate determination of glucose. The enzyme catalyzed oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide with the subsequent reaction of hydrogen peroxide with excess iodide to produce tri-iodide {{is followed by the}} change in the absorbance of the solution. Equations are derived which relate the photometer response to the rate of change of the tri-iodide concentration in the solution. Optimum results for high or low glucose concentration ranges were obtained with a low or high enzyme concentration respectively. Methods for obtaining <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> curves with or without using a blank solution are discussed. <b>Linear</b> <b>calibration</b> curves were obtained for glucose concentrations from 10 - 110 ppm with a reproducibility of about 2 ppm...|$|R

This redox reaction was studied by cyclic voltammetry in aqueous acidic solution. Well-resolved oxidation waves were observed and the voltammetric peaks exhibited naphthol concentration dependence. <b>Linear</b> <b>calibration</b> curves were obtained after a simple electrochemical anodic pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|Piperacillin-tazobactam is a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase {{combination}} antibiotic used {{in patients}} with moderate to severe infection. Dosing of piperacillin-tazobactam requires an understanding of this patient group to maximise {{the effectiveness of this}} antibiotic and limit a further emergence of resistant pathogens. This is the first method that measures piperacillin and tazobactam simultaneously, across this range of clinically-relevant biological matrices. The <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> was <b>linear</b> across the concentration range of 0. 5 – 500 μg/mL for piperacillin and 0. 625 – 62. 5 μg/mL for tazobactam. All validation testing for matrix effects, precision and accuracy, specificity and stability were within 15 %. A calibration equivalence study was performed to investigate the suitability of applying calibration curves prepared in an alternative matrix, with a mean bias of − 10. 8 % identified for the application of a <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> prepared for tazobactam in plasma only. Bias for all other <b>calibration</b> <b>lines</b> prepared in alternate matrices was within the 5 % acceptance criteria. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of a critically ill patient receiving renal replacement therapy, with the results included...|$|R

50|$|Hydrostatic gauges (such as {{the mercury}} column manometer) compare {{pressure}} to the hydrostatic force per unit area {{at the base of}} a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very <b>linear</b> <b>calibration.</b> They have poor dynamic response.|$|R
40|$|A new {{calibration}} {{model of}} a radio telescope that includes pointing error is presented, which considers nonlinear errors in the azimuth axis. For a large radio telescope, in particular for a telescope with a turntable, {{it is difficult to}} correct pointing errors using a traditional <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> model, because errors produced by the wheel-on-rail or center bearing structures are generally nonlinear. Fourier expansion is made for the oblique error and parameters describing the inclination direction along the azimuth axis based on the <b>linear</b> <b>calibration</b> model, and a new calibration model for pointing is derived. The new pointing model is applied to the 40 m radio telescope administered by Yunnan Observatories, which is a telescope that uses a turntable. The results show that this model can significantly reduce the residual systematic errors due to nonlinearity in the azimuth axis compared with the linear model...|$|R
