We analyze and model grain damage on samples recovered from impact tests of dry and water saturated sandstone at stress levels and duration similar to that of perforation loading. Analyses of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images and laser particle size measurements on portions of the recovered samples characterize grain damage and changes in grain size distribution. Hybrid modeling that combines the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), and includes mesoscale representation of grain/pore structure, shows how grain damage evolves for dry and wet conditions. Modeling defines behavior in accord with recovered sample analyses as follows: (1) Increase in grain damage is obtained with an increase in stress <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> duration. (2) The grains in dry samples are extremely and irregularly fragmented with extensive reduced porosity. (3) Less grain damage and higher porosity is obtained in saturated samples.

30|$|Demand {{response}} {{is a basic}} tool used to develop modern power systems and electricity markets. Residential and commercial segments account for 40 %– 50 % of the overall electricity demand. These segments need to overcome major obstacles {{before they can be}} included in a demand response portfolio. The objective {{of this paper is to}} tackle some of the technical barriers and explain how the potential of enabling technology (smart meters) can be harnessed, to evaluate the potential of customers for demand response (end-uses and their behaviors) and, moreover, to validate customers’ effective response to market prices or system events by means of non-intrusive methods. A tool based on the Hilbert transform is improved herein to identify and characterize the most suitable loads for the aforesaid purpose, whereby important characteristics such as cycling frequency, power <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> width are identified. The proposed methodology allows the filtering of aggregated load according to the amplitudes of elemental loads, independently of the frequency of their behaviors that could be altered by internal or external inputs such as weather or demand response. In this way, the assessment and verification of customer response can be improved by solving the problem of load aggregation with the help of integral transforms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The surge {{protective}} device (SPD), as buildings over-voltage {{protective device}}, has been widely used in building’s power distribution system. A novel SPD based on hollow cathode effects is designed. In both air and nitrogen gas, the relationship of discharging voltage and gas pressure are measured, and the critical pressure ranges are determined in the condition of Up< 4 kV (Up is pulse voltage protection level). The results indicate that, in {{the condition of the}} gap distance D= 3 mm and the small hole diameter φ = 3 mm, the operating gas pressure ranges are from 50 to 5 × 104 Pa. With the gap distance D increasing, the pulse voltage protection level Up is decreasing slightly. While D= 3 mm, φ = 3 mm, and gas pressure (nitrogen) is 600 Pa, the DC voltage protection <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> protection level are 784 V and 2. 4 kV, respectively. In the action of 10 / 350 µs pulse current waveform, the quantity of transferred charge Q is 48. 26 C, and the ratio energy W/R is up to 2 MJ/Ω.

40|$|Continuous {{measurement}} of oxygen <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate {{is very important}} for aged people, pregnant women and in many other critical situations. This is commonly monitored by a pulse oxymeter. This paper presents a low-cost and a miniaturized pulse oxymeter to continuously measure patient‟s blood-oxygen saturation level (SpO 2) and pulse rate. Change in intensity of light transmitted through tissue due to arterial blood pulse can be measured as a voltage signal called the photoplethysmographm (PPG). Oxygenated blood has different light absorption characteristics than deoxygenated blood under red and infra red wavelengths. So the hardware implementation is included placing of two LEDs (red and infra red) on the patient‟s finger and a photo detector on opposite side of the LEDs to get the corresponding PPG signals which are used to estimate the SpO 2 by comparing the absorption characteristics of the two different colored light (red and infra red). As the PPG signal is mostly corrupted by patient‟s hand movement, it is given to LabView window by DAQ card for further signal processing. In this paper a low pass filter is used for removing motion artifacts and a moving average algorithm is applied to remove high frequency noise content. The SpO 2 is calculated by computing the AC and DC components of both the red and infra red LEDs corresponding PPG signals. The pulse rate is determined by time domain peak detection algorithm in LabView signal processing module...|$|E

Furthermore, much progress has been achieved with regard to the ultrasound-assisted extraction of grape peel, anthocyanins and resveratrol (Cho et al. 2006; Li et al. 2010 a, b; Ghafoor et al. 2009; Tao et al. 2014). Moreover, the effects of solvent type, extraction temperature, solvent/solid ratio, amplitude <b>level,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> duration/pulse interval ratio on the yield of phenolics extraction could be optimized to improve quantity the and quality of recovery compounds (Goula et al. 2016). Pan et al. (2012) reported that UAE reduced the extraction time of phenolic compounds from pomegranate peels by 87 % and presented an antioxidant activity greater than 22 % greater than those obtained by maceration. Carrera et al. (2012) also reported a reduction in the time of extraction of phenolic compounds from grapes with UAE requiring 10 times less extraction time than that of maceration. All the above studies reported that this improvement in extraction with the use of ultrasound favors the rupture of the cell wall, with the subsequent increase in the penetration of the solvent. Propagation of the ultrasonic waves through a liquid medium causes damage to the vegetal wall resulting in high solvent penetration and the subsequent release of the content of polyphenolic compounds (Medina-Torres et al. 2017). The UAE 9 i previously described has also been used for dietary fiber extraction, suggesting that it is a good alternative for the extraction of pectin from grape pomace on an industrial scale (Minjares-Fuentes et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Most {{auditory}} prostheses use modulated electric pulse {{trains to}} excite the auditory nerve. There are, however, scant data regarding {{the effects of}} pulse trains on auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses across the duration of such stimuli. We examined how temporal ANF properties changed with <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate across 300 -ms pulse trains. Four measures were examined: (1) first-spike latency, (2) interspike interval (ISI), (3) vector strength (VS), and (4) Fano factor (FF, an index of the temporal variability of responsiveness). Data were obtained using 250 -, 1, 000 -, and 5, 000 -pulse/s stimuli. First-spike latency decreased with increasing spike rate, with relatively small decrements observed for 5, 000 -pulse/s trains, presumably reflecting integration. ISIs to low-rate (250 pulse/s) trains were strongly locked to the stimuli, whereas ISIs evoked with 5, 000 -pulse/s trains were dominated by refractory and adaptation effects. Across time, VS decreased for low-rate trains but not for 5, 000 -pulse/s stimuli. At relatively high spike rates (> 200 spike/s), VS values for 5, 000 -pulse/s trains were lower than those obtained with 250 -pulse/s stimuli (even after accounting for the smaller periods of the 5, 000 -pulse/s stimuli), indicating a desynchronizing effect of high-rate stimuli. FF measures also indicated a desynchronizing effect of high-rate trains. Across {{a wide range of}} response rates, FF underwent relatively fast increases (i. e., within 100  ms) for 5, 000 -pulse/s stimuli. With a few exceptions, ISI, VS, and FF measures approached asymptotic values within the 300 -ms duration of the low- and high-rate trains. These findings may have implications for designs of cochlear implant stimulus protocols, understanding electrically evoked compound action potentials, and interpretation of neural measures obtained at central nuclei, which depend on understanding the output of the auditory nerve...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{often have}} lower (white coat effect) or higher (masked effect) ambulatory/home blood {{pressure}} readings compared to clinic measurements, resulting in misdiagnosis of hypertension. The present study assessed whether {{blood pressure and}} patient characteristics from a single clinic visit can accurately predict the difference between ambulatory/home and clinic blood pressure readings (the ‘home-clinic difference’). A linear regression model predicting the home-clinic blood pressure difference was derived in two datasets measuring automated clinic and ambulatory/home blood pressure (n= 991) using candidate predictors identified from a literature review. The model was validated in four further datasets (n= 1, 172) using Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis. A masked effect was associated with male sex, a positive clinic blood pressure change (difference between consecutive measurements during a single visit) and a diagnosis of hypertension. Increasing age, clinic blood pressure <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure were associated with a white coat effect. The model showed good calibration across datasets (Pearson’s correlation 0. 48 - 0. 80) and performed well predicting ambulatory hypertension (AUROC 0. 75, 95 %CI 0. 72 - 0. 79 [systolic]; 0. 87, 95 %CI 0. 85 - 0. 89 [diastolic]). Used as a triaging tool for ambulatory monitoring, the model improved classification of a patient’s blood pressure status compared with other guideline recommended approaches (93 % [92 - 95 %] classified correctly; US 73 % [70 - 75 %]; Canada 74 % [71 - 77 %]; UK 78 % [76 - 81 %]). This study demonstrates that patient characteristics from a single clinic visit can accurately predict a patient’s ambulatory blood pressure. Utilisation of this prediction tool for triaging of ambulatory monitoring could result in more accurate diagnosis of hypertension and hence more appropriate treatment...|$|E
40|$|Pulse tube {{refrigerators}} (PTR) are robust, rugged cryocoolers that do {{not have}} a moving component at their cold ends. They are often employed for cryogenic cooling of high performance electronics in space applications where reliability is paramount. Miniaturizing these refrigerators has been a subject of intense research interest because of the benefits of minimal size and weight for airborne operation and because miniature coolers would be an enabling technology for other applications. Despite much effort, the extent of possible PTR miniaturization is still uncertain. To partially remedy this, an investigation of the miniaturization of pulse tube refrigerators has been undertaken using several numerical modeling techniques. In support of these models, experiments were performed to determine directional hydrodynamic parameters characteristic of stacked screens of # 635 stainless steel and # 325 phosphor bronze wire mesh, two fine-mesh porous materials suitable for use in the regenerator and heat exchanger components of miniature PTRs. Complete system <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> tube component level CFD models incorporating these parameters were then employed to quantitatively estimate the effects of several phenomena expected to impact the performance of miniature PTRs. These included the presence of preferential flow paths in an annular region near the regenerator wall and increased viscous and thermal boundary layer thicknesses relative to the pulse tube diameter. The effects of tapering or chamfering the junctions between components of dissimilar diameters were also investigated. The results of these models were subsequently applied to produce successively smaller micro-scale PTR models having total volumes as small as 0. 141 cc for which sufficient net cooling was predicted to make operation at cryogenic temperatures feasible. The results of this investigation provide design criteria for miniaturized PTRs and establish the feasibility of their operation at frequencies up to 1000 Hz with dimensions roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those that have recently been demonstrated, provided that challenges related to their regenerator fillers and compressors can be addressed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To examine {{potential}} {{associations between}} body height, cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference (TLCPD) and prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in a population-based setting. METHODS: The population-based Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 {{individuals with a}} mean age of 64. 6 ± 9. 8 years (range: 50 - 93 years). A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed. Based on a previous study with lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) measurements, CSFP was calculated as CSFP[mmHg] = 0. 44 × Body Mass Index[kg/m(2) ] + 0. 16 × Diastolic Blood Pressure[mmHg]- 0. 18 × Age[Years]- 1. 91. RESULTS: Data of IOP and CSFP were available for 3353 (96. 7 %) subjects. Taller body height was associated with higher CSFP (P< 0. 001; standardized correlation coefficient beta: 0. 13; regression coefficient B: 0. 29; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 25, 0. 33) after adjusting for male gender, urban region of habitation, higher educational <b>level,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate. If TLCPD instead of CSFP was added, taller body height was associated with lower TLCPD (P< 0. 001;beta:- 0. 10;B:- 0. 20; 95 %CI:- 0. 25,- 0. 15). Correspondingly, higher CSFP was associated with taller body height (P = 0. 003;beta: 0. 02;B: 0. 01; 95 %CI: 0. 00, 0. 02), after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, pulse, systolic blood pressure, and blood concentration of cholesterol. If IOP was added to the model, higher CSFP was associated with higher IOP (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 02;B: 0. 02; 95 %CI: 0. 01, 0. 03). TLCPD was associated with lower body height (P = 0. 003;beta:- 0. 04;B - 0. 02, 95 %CI:- 0. 04,- 0. 01) after adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, pulse, blood concentrations of triglycerides, axial length, central corneal thickness, corneal curvature radius, and anterior chamber depth. Adding the prevalence of OAG to the multivariate analysis revealed, that taller body height was associated with a lower OAG prevalence (P = 0. 03;beta:- 0. 03;B:- 1. 20; 95 %CI:- 2. 28,- 0. 12) after adjusting for educational level and gender.

40|$|Athletes, coaches, {{and sports}} {{academics}} are constantly working to maximize the, so called, sports form {{during the most}} important competitions. The form peak is usually achieved by decreasing the training load in the pre-scheduled period before the competition. This period of "cut-down" training {{is referred to as}} the tapering (or the taper). Tapering is a complex process affected by the number of factors, including volume, intensity, and frequency of training. If this process is successful, it is possible to achieve the peak form at the time of the major competitions. Tapering can thus become one of the most decisive factors in preparing an athlete for a competition. Aim of the paper and research questions. The research was undertaken under the grant RSA 2 023 52 aimed at supporting the academic sport. The aim of the study was to identify the type and size of tapering used by coaches from the athletic section of KS AZS AWF Wroclaw in relation to top ranked athletes competing for the Academic World Championships, World and European Championships, and the Olympic Games. The utilitarian purpose was to develop recommendations for optimal tapering strategies. Method and test material The method of observation and measurement was applied. The training loads and responses to these loads during the direct competing preparation mesocycle (BPS) were recorded during the athlete's training cycle in 2014. The study involved two training groups coached by the TT and MR coaches from the athletic section of AZS AWF in Wrocław. The research material consisted of coaches' recordings, training diary entries, and records of training loads measurements performed during training units. These data were verified by lactate <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate measurements, which allowed controlling the selected physiological effects of training. The most important information from the study is that both coaches performed tapering only in the volume of training. In no case did the training frequency change. The structure of the 7 -day microcycle was kept until the start day. No training unit had been canceled. Both coaches had never decreased the intensity of the means used, and they even motivated the athletes by measurements of the running time to increase the intensity, i. e. the speed for the running sections. Therefore, the tapering strategy adopted by the coaches did not concern either the frequency or the intensity of trainings, but only the volume of training measures used. Based on the results of the research and their analysis, the following conclusions can be formulated: 1. Trainers implement personal tapering programs. 2. In the analyzed cases, the tapering period amounted to approximately 16 days. 3. Tapering consisted in reducing the volume of workload to 30 - 60 %, depending on the training unit type. 4. No workload intensity and training frequency have been decrease...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the research and}} development of a decision support tool for determining a medical patient's suitability for surgical anaesthesia. At present, there is a change in the way that patients are clinically assessedp rior to surgery. The pre-operative assessment, usually conducted by a qualified anaesthetist, is being more frequently performed by nursing grade staff. The pre-operative assessmenet xists to minimise the risk of surgical complications for the patient. Nursing grade staff are often not as experienced as qualified anaesthetists, and thus are not as well suited to the role of performing the pre-operative assessment. This research project used data collected during pre-operative assessments to develop a decision support tool that would assist the nurse (or anaesthetist) in determining whether a patient is suitable for surgical anaesthesia. The three main objectives are: firstly, to research and develop an automated intelligent systems technique for classifying heart and lung sounds and hence identifying cardio-respiratory pathology. Secondly, to research and develop an automated intelligent systems technique for assessing the patient's blood oxygen <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> waveform. Finally, to develop a decision support tool that would combine the assessmentsa bove in forming a decision as to whether the patient is suitable for surgical anaesthesia. Clinical data were collected from hospital outpatient departments and recorded alongside the diagnoses made by a qualified anaesthetist. Heart and lung sounds were collected using an electronic stethoscope. Using this data two ensembles of artificial neural networks were trained to classify the different heart and lung sounds into different pathology groups. Classification accuracies up to 99. 77 % for the heart sounds, and 100 % for the lung sounds has been obtained. Oxygen saturation and pulse waveform measurements were recorded using a pulse oximeter. Using this data an artificial neural network was trained to discriminate between normal and abnormal pulse waveforms. A discrimination accuracy of 98 % has been obtained from the system. A fuzzy inference system was generated to classify the patient's blood oxygen level as being either an inhibiting or non-inhibiting factor in their suitability for surgical anaesthesia. When tested the system successfully classified 100 % of the test dataset. A decision support tool, applying the genetic programming evolutionary technique to a fuzzy classification system was created. The decision support tool combined the results from the heart sound, lung sound and pulse oximetry classifiers in determining whether a patient was suitable for surgical anaesthesia. The evolved fuzzy system attained a classification accuracy of 91. 79 %. The principal conclusion from this thesis is that intelligent systems, such as artificial neural networks, genetic programming, and fuzzy inference systems, can be successfully applied to the creation of medical decision support tools.

40|$|Background: Essential oils {{have been}} used as an {{alternative}} and complementary treatment in medicine. Citrus fragrance has been used by aromatherapists for the treatment of anxiety symptoms. Based on this claim, the aim of present study was to investigate the effect of aromatherapy with essential oil of orange on child anxiety during dental treatment. Materials and Methods: Thirty children (10 boys, 20 girls) aged 6 - 9 years participated in a crossover intervention study, according to the inclusion criteria, among patients who attended the pediatric department of Isfahan Dental School in 2011. Every child underwent two dental treatment appointments including dental prophylaxis and fissure-sealant therapy under orange aroma in one session (intervention) and without any aroma (control) in another one. Child anxiety level was measured using salivary cortisol <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate before <b>and</b> after treatment in each visit. The data were analyzed using t-test by SPSS software version 18. Results: The mean ± SD and mean difference of salivary cortisol <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate were calculated in each group before and completion of treatment in each visit. The difference in means of salivary cortisol <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate between treatment under orange odor and treatment without aroma was 1. 047 ± 2. 198 nmol/l and 6. 73 ± 12. 3 (in minutes), which was statistically significant using paired t-test (P = 0. 014, P = 0. 005, respectively). Conclusion: It seems that the use of aromatherapy with natural essential oil of orange could reduce salivary cortisol <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> rate due to child anxiety state...|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the laser}} {{settings}} most commonly advised for cavity preparation, {{the most important}} parameters are energy <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition rate because they {{are related to the}} laser’s ablation ability and to the deposition of residual heat on dental substrates (Souza-Gabriel et al. 2009). Use of the lower parameters (200 – 300  mJ, 2  Hz) for preparation with the Er:YAG laser produced dentin microindentation hardness results similar to those for bur-prepared cavities (Souza-Gabriel et al. 2009). Similarly, Chinelatti et al. (2010) have shown that high Er:YAG laser energy levels (260 – 360  mJ, 3  Hz) reduced the subsurface microindentation hardness of superficial and deep dentin because of the denaturation of the dentin organic matrix with a strong modification of the collagen chain. In this study, microindentation hardness measurement was performed under cavity preparations at distances of 25  μm {{from the middle of the}} cavity floor (superficial dentin) with Er:YAG laser irradiation used at low power settings (250  mJ/ 4  Hz), which may be a possible explanation of the similar microindentation hardness measurement for laser- and bur-prepared dentin.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} measurement methods for dosimetry and exposimetry quantities that were developed in the EMRP project “Dosimetry for Ultrasound Therapy -DUTy” by comparing the measurement results for three common quantities from three national laboratories. It further aims to investigate the general feasibility of possible future (key) comparisons for dosimetry and exposimetry quantities and to identify possible open challenges towards this goal. The general format {{is similar to a}} metrological comparison, with which the National Metrological Institutes, NMIs, are already familiar. The first step involved the agreement of the protocol that was to specify the set of transducers to be circulated and the measurement conditions. Two transducers were circulated and different drive voltage <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulsing</b> regimes were defined and tissue mimicking materials (TMMs) characteristics were specified. Each lab was asked to prepare the TMMs for their own measurements with the inclusion of formulations and preparation instructions specified in the protocol. Uncertainties of the input data were to be declared by the participating laboratories...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} process between co-propagating signal <b>and</b> control <b>pulses</b> {{has been}} proposed and demon-strated numerically, based on semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA). Results show that a Gaussian signal pulse with picosecond duration can be simultaneously amplified and compressed in a SOA by utilizing a co-propagating high-intensity control pulse. To obtain high quality signal pulse with high peak power <b>level</b> <b>and</b> short <b>pulse</b> width, the center carrier wavelengths of two pulses should locate in the gain region of the SOA. The initial delay time between both pulses should be tuned suitably before entering the SOA.

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{microwave}} irradiation {{to accelerate the}} onset of equilibrium and improve ELISA performance was examined using ELISAs {{for the detection of}} the plant toxin ricin and gliadin. The ricin ELISA normally requires several one hour incubations at 37 °C, a total assay time of approximately five hours, and employs a complex buffer containing PBS, Tween- 20 ®, and non-fat milk. Different energy <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> designs were compared to the use of abbreviated incubation times at 37 °C for the detection of ricin in food. The use of microwave irradiation had no significant advantage over the application of heat using an oven incubator and performed worse with some foods. In contrast, a gliadin ELISA that relied on 30 min incubation steps at room temperature and a salt-based buffer performed better upon irradiation but also displayed improvement upon incubating the microtiter plate at 37 °C. Whether microwave irradiation was advantageous compared to incubation in an oven was inconclusive. However, by abbreviating the incubation time of the ricin ELISA, it was possible to cut the assay time to less than 2 hours and still display LOD values < 10 ppb and recoveries of 78 %– 98 %...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the laser beam welding of tips to central and side spark plug {{electrodes}} made of a nickel-chromium alloy. The tips attached to the central electrodes were made from a solid iridium wire 0. 8 mm in diameter and 2 mm in length, while the tips connected to the side electrodes were made from a platinum wire 1. 5 mm in diameter and 0. 25 mm in thickness. In both cases, accurate positioning of the tips was required before they were resistance welded to the electrodes. Then, a fillet weld was produced with an Nd:YAG laser using single, partly overlapping conductive pulses. The laser welding was performed at different laser power <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> durations. Metallographic sections of the joints were prepared to observe changes in the microstructure and determine their correlation with {{the changes in the}} process parameters. The results were used to select appropriate welding parameters for the materials joined. The microscopic analysis indicated welding imperfections such as micro cracks at the interface between the elements joined. The tips welded to the spark plug electrodes can help extend the service life of spark plugs in highly corrosive environments...|$|R
