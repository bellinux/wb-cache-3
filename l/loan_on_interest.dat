40|$|This paper {{raises the}} issue of an initial structure-objective {{mismatch}} in the launching of Islamic finance. The abolition of interest and promotion of growth with equity were goals of the conceived system. These goals expressed a long run vision to improve {{the condition of the}} Muslim communities across the world. However, the organizational form adopted for Islamic finance was of the existing commercial banks which provided essentially short-term <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> to trade industry and commerce. The choice thus involved an intrinsic mismatch between the structure and objectives of Islamic finance. The mismatch did carry some advantages, but on a more important side it exposed Islamic finance to commitments and influences which could not mostly align well with the goals the pioneers had in mind. Note that in focus here is not the reversal of the mismatch but its consequences that have forced the nascent Islamic system to convergence and competition with the mature conventional finance the West dominates. It is not the ground realities that are being adapted to Shari’ah norms; it is the norms that are being stretched to limit for meeting the demands of the conventional system. Ordinary Muslims who hoped to benefit from Islamic financing remain unattended. Thus, what Islamic finance can or cannot change will depend on where its ongoing integration with the conventional system leads it to. Currently, most merits claimed for the Islamic system defy evidence. The basic reforms financial systems require in the face of current crisis are the control of credit, leverage lure, and speculation. Islamic finance is in principle better equipped to achieve these ends. ...|$|R

60|$|Turgot himself, however, found time, in his {{industry}} at Limoges, {{to make a}} contribution to a kind of literature which has seriously modified the practical arrangements and social relations of the western world. In 1766 he published his Essay on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth--a short but most pithy treatise, in which he anticipated some of the leading economic principles of that greater work by Adam Smith, which was given to the world ten years later. Turgot's Essay has none of the breadth of historic outlook, and none of the amplitude of concrete illustrations from real affairs, which make the Wealth of Nations so deeply fertile, so persuasive, so interesting, so thoroughly alive, so genuinely enriching {{to the understanding of the}} judicious reader. But the comparative dryness of Turgot's too concise form does not blind the historian of political economy to the merit of the substance of his propositions. It was no small proof of originality and enlightenment to precede Adam Smith by ten years in the doctrines of free trade, of free industry, of <b>loans</b> <b>on</b> <b>interest,</b> of the constitutive elements of price, of the effects of the division of labour, of the processes of the formation of capital. The passage <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> will bear reproducing once more:--'We may regard the rate of interest as a kind of level, below which all labour, all cultivation, all industry, all commerce ceases. It is like a sea spreading out over a vast district; the tops of the mountains rise above the waters and form fertile and cultivated islands. If the sea by any chance finds an outlet, then in proportion as it goes down, first the slopes, next the plains and valleys, appear and clothe themselves with productions of every kind. It is enough that the sea rises or falls by a foot, to inundate vast shores, or to restore them to cultivation and plenty.' There are not many illustrations at once so apt and so picturesque as this, but most of the hundred paragraphs that make up the Reflections are, notwithstanding one or two of the characteristic crotchets of Quesnai's school, both accurate and luminous.|$|R

Our database covers the period 2006 – 2009 for a total of 560 339 firms and 214 banks. Our analysis shows that collateral guarantee affects the cost of credit for Italian firms by systematically reducing the interest rate of secured loans. This effect was larger during the crisis. Personal guarantees show no systematic effect <b>on</b> <b>interest</b> rates, but favour firms’ access to credit. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers, i. e., the decrease in interest rates due to the presence of guarantees is larger for the former than for the latter...|$|R

However, when loans become non-performing, they tend to have some serious effects on the financial health of banks. In view of the critical role banks play in the economy of a country, it is worth finding out the causes of non-performing loan. The study was carried out to identify the impact of non-performing <b>loan</b> <b>on</b> <b>loan</b> <b>interest</b> income, and lending fund, focusing on Dashen Bank Mekelle Area Bank. The study also looked at the trend of non-performing loans during the five-year period under review and the factors that account for non-performing loan from both borrower and lending institution side. Primary and secondary data were used in the study. Primary data gathering tools such as structured questionnaires and personal interviews were used. Regarding secondary data, client’s files, report directives, and annual reports of the bank were used. The findings showed that the bank recorded huge amount of non-performing loan during the period under consideration (2005 - 2009). It was identified that the non-performing loan negatively affected the financial performance of the bank through reduction in loan interest income and lending funds. The study identified ineffective loan monitoring and poor credit appraisal as the major factors accounting for non-performing loan from the lending institution side and lack of proper education on business area, lack of sufficient income, absence of sufficient infrastructure, lack of sufficient supervision from the bank, lack of saving account, high consumption expenditure and high interest charge were identified as the causes for non-performing loan from the borrower side. To improve {{on the quality of the}} bank’s loan portfolio, the management commonly uses loan rehabilitation. Some measures have been recommended to management of the bank to minimize the existing burden of non-performing loan those are Credit training programs, effective loan monitoring i. e. giving good on sight supervision to client, full filling required credit staff and giving awareness to clients to present adequate collateral and advising clients to have good knowledge on the business area they engaged...|$|R
