5|$|The first {{shooting}} thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by {{the sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} <b>Latin</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union.</b> Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series of shooting thalers, following the standards of the <b>Latin</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union,</b> began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the Monetary Union ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series of shooting thalers in 1934 in honor of the shooting festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses. Production of shooting thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series of shooting thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based coin dealer Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal fineness and are not considered legal tender.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper uses {{a dynamic}} {{stochastic}} {{general equilibrium model}} with three countries to {{study the effects of}} implementation of an open <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> on international fluctuations. We consider the effects of unanticipated country specific shocks on technology and government spending. We compare the resulting fluctuations to a benchmark case with three independent currencies. We find that the implementation of <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> reverses the expenditure switching effects between the goods produced inside the <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> and that the implementation of <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> stabilizes the fluctuations caused by shocks emerging inside the <b>monetary</b> <b>union.</b> We also find that countries benefit more from positive technology shocks when they are members of a <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> and that in the <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> the negative spillovers resulting from fiscal expansion by one member country are rather small...|$|R

Consequently, in 1889, Romania {{unilaterally}} joined the <b>Latin</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> and adopted a gold standard. Silver coins were legal tender only up to 50 lei. All taxes and customs dues were to be paid in gold and, owing to the small quantities issued from the Romanian mint, foreign gold coins were current, especially French 20-franc pieces (equal at par to 20 lei), Turkish gold lire (22.70), old Russian imperials (20.60) and British sovereigns (25.22).|$|E

40|$|While the European <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (EMU) {{is now a}} reality, {{debate among}} economists {{nonetheless}} continues about the design and desirability of <b>monetary</b> <b>unions.</b> Since {{an essential element of}} a <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> is the delegation of monetary power to a single centralized entity, one of the key issues in this debate is whether a <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> will limit the effectiveness of stabilization policy. If so, <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> will not necessarily be welfare improving. In this paper, we study a two-country world economy and consider various designs of <b>monetary</b> <b>union.</b> We argue that the success of <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> depends on : (i) the commitment ability of the single central bank, (ii) the policy flexibility of the national fiscal authorities and the central monetary authority and (iii) the cross country correlation of shocks. If, for example, the central bank moves before the fiscal authorities, then a <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> will increase welfare as long as fiscal policy is sufficiently responsive to shocks. However, if the fiscal authorities have a restricted set of tools and/or the monetary authority lacks the ability to commit to its policy, then <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> may not be desirable. ...|$|R

The currency was devalued by 30% following the devaluations of the British pound, U.S. dollar and French franc. In 1945, Switzerland joined the Bretton Woods system and pegged the franc to the U.S. dollar {{at a rate of}} $1 = 4.30521 francs (equivalent to 1 franc = 0.206418grams of gold).

25|$|The period {{preceding}} the Long Depression {{had been one}} of increasing economic internationalism, championed by efforts such as the <b>Latin</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union,</b> many of which then were derailed or stunted by the impacts of economic uncertainty. The extraordinary collapse of farm prices provoked a protectionist response in many nations. Rejecting the free trade policies of the Second Empire, French president Adolphe Thiers led the new Third Republic to protectionism, which led ultimately to the stringent Méline tariff in 1892. Germany's agrarian Junker aristocracy, under attack by cheap, imported grain, successfully agitated for a protective tariff in 1879 in Otto von Bismarck's Germany over the protests of his National Liberal Party allies. In 1887, Italy and France embarked on a bitter tariff war. In the United States, Benjamin Harrison won the 1888 US presidential election on a protectionist pledge.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} thirty-one he {{was already}} Minister of Finance {{at the end of}} 1873.

In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the <b>Latin</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> and he baptised the new domestic currency, the dinar, after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, a yoke of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.|$|E

The twenty-cent piece was to be equivalent to one French franc in that system, and if in proportion to the smaller silver coins being struck, would weigh five grams, a fact which appealed to advocates of the metric system in Congress. Another purpose for a large issue of silver coins, regardless of denomination, was to retire the fractional currency—low-value paper money or [...] "shinplasters".
