Refrigeration of high-boiling LPC is needed to increase its density and to create cold reserve for compensation of heat flows existing during fueling and prelaunch operations of space rockets. The method and results of simulation of LPC refrigeration in the recuperative heat exchangers with heat carrier which is <b>refrigerated</b> by-turn with <b>liquid</b> nitrogen sparging. The refrigerating system consists of two tanks (for the chilled coolant and LPC), LPC and heat carrier circulation loops with heat exchanger and system of heat carrier refrigeration in its tank with bubbler. Application of intermediate heat carrier between LPC and liquid nitrogen allows to avoid LPC crystallization on cold surfaces of the heat exchanger. Simulation of such systems performance is necessary to determine its basic design and functional parameters ensuring effective <b>refrigerating</b> of <b>liquid</b> propellant components, time and the amount of liquid nitrogen spent on refrigeration operation. Creating a simulator is quite complicated because of the need to take into consideration many different heat exchange processes occurring in the system. Also, to determine the influence of various parameters on occurring processes it is necessary to take into consideration the dependence of all heat exchange parameters on each other: heat emission coefficients, heat transfer coefficients, heat flow amounts, etc. The paper offers an overview of 10 references to foreign and Russian publications on separate issues and processes occurring in <b>liquids</b> <b>refrigerating,</b> including LPC refrigeration with liquid nitrogen. Concluded the need to define the LPC refrigerating conditions to minimize cost of liquid nitrogen. The experimental data presented in these publications is conformed with the application of the simulator and its parts. In the proposed algorithm of calculations a simulator consists of three blocks with data and intermediate results exchange with each other. Blocks contain subsimulator of heat gain in the LPC and heat carrier circulation loops, cooling-heating subsimulator of LPC and the heat carrier in the heat exchanger and heat exchange subsimulator of LPC and heat carrier in its tanks. Functional dependence of thermophysical properties of LPC and heat carrier and its temperatures, as well as characteristics of the pumps are taken into consideration in calculations. Pump heat gain subsimulator includes hydrauliccirculation loop calculation and the calculation of the heat flow emitted by pump. Subsimulator of the heat exchanger is based on differential equations of static heat exchange, where the integration variable is length coordinate of heat exchanger. The output data of these subsimulators are input data in heat exchange subsimulator of LPC and heat carrier in its tanks, which is based on the differential equations of quasi-stationary heat exchange. Simulation results are interpolated functions of LPC, heat carrier and the metal shells temperatures. Analyzing these functions graphs one can determine the performance indicators of the refrigerating system: refrigerating time and the relative costs of liquid nitrogen (mass of liquid nitrogen spent, referred to the weight of the refrigerated LPC). For example in the case of refrigerating portions 13260 kg and 3300 kg of high-boiling oxidizer with various combinations of design and functional parameters the refrigeration time is 2. 8 [...] . 78. 3 hours, and the relative costs of nitrogen amounted to 0, 178 [...] . 0, 322.

Nevertheless, it can have a determining impact on wheat processing or on final product yield or quality, hence the use of xylanases to optimize wheat applications. In the last 20 years knowledge on xylanase functionality has been gradually building up. The presence and impact of wheat kernel associated xylanases has, however, largely been overlooked and was the object of several studies. Results of these studies indicated that xylanases associated with wheat kernels consist of wheat endogenous xylanases {{on one hand and}} kernel-associated microbial endoxylanases on the other hand. Levels and ratios between different types of enzymes were shown to vary significantly with harvest year and wheat variety. In some cases, wheat kernel-associated microbial endoxylanases accounted for over 90 % of the total wheat-associated xylanase activity. The impact of these xylanases on two systems, i. e. refrigerated doughs subjected to longer term storage and wheat bread doughs subjected to a normal fermentation process, was investigated. Using debranning as a tool to remove the majority of kernel-associated microbial xylanases prior to milling, we were able to show that the onset and extent of dough syruping (the undesirable appearance of a brown <b>liquid)</b> during <b>refrigerated</b> dough storage was drastically reduced when using flour samples which contained reduced levels of xylanases. In normal bread doughs, mainly inhibition insensitive endogenous xylanases were active, and led to increased solubilization of arabinoxylan in the dough, probably affecting the end product.

The dielectric cooling liquid represents an effective thermal management solution for high-power LEDs due to their superior heat transfer characteristics compared with air. The new proposed configuration, based on phosphor converted blue LEDs, is investigated by setting up a thermal model and validated through performed experimental tests. A series of experiments were performed on four LED configurations (air/silicon oil as cooling agent, and with/without heat sink) in steady state and heating/cooling transient processes to evaluate the heat dissipation performances. The thermal modeling and experimental results were compared and highlighted, demonstrating good agreement.

40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the dynamic {{reliability}} of safety systems and {{its application to}} a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>liquid</b> cryogenic ammonia storage tank is presented. The method {{is based on the}} theory of Markov chains and can model dynamic phenomena of the process and its safety systems. It offers the capability of modelling realistically the competing process of repairing failed safety systems and the exceeding of safe limits by some critical physical parameters of the process. The results of the Markovian analysis are compared to those of the classical Fault Tree/Event Tree methods and it is shown that the proposed method offers a substantial improvement over the classical approach. The probability of failure from overpressure of a cryogenic ammonia storage tank depends in general on the level of the ammonia in the tank at the time of accident initiation. Assuming a uniform distribution for the ammonia level in the tank, the average upper and lower limits for the failure probability over a year provided by the FT/ET methods span three orders of magnitude [1. 4 x 10 (- 1) - 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) ] depending on whether repair is considered or not.

Seven problems of medium large spaces in these fields are presented. Numerical models were developed and used for the simulation of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer for these problems. Governing equations representing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved numerically resulting in the solution of velocity, pressure, temperature, and species concentration(s). Numerical solutions were presented as 2 -D and 3 -D plots that provide more insightful understanding of the relevant transport phenomena. Parametric studies on geometric dimensions and/or boundary conditions were carried out. Four designs of ZBO cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage tank were studied for their thermal performance under heat leak from the surroundings. Steady state analyses show that higher flow rate of forced fluid flow yields lower maximum fluid temperature. 3 -D simulation provides the visualization of the complex structures of the 3 -D distributions of the fluid velocity and temperature. Transient analysis results in the patterns of fluid velocity and temperature for various stages of a proposed cooling cycle and the prediction of its effective operating term. A typical refrigerated warehouse with a set of ceiling type cooling units were modeled and simulated with both 2 -D and 3 -D models. It was found that if the cooling units are closer to the stacks of stored packages, lower and more uniform temperature distribution can be achieved. The enhancement of thermal comfort in an air-conditioned residential room by using a ceiling fan was studied and quantified to show that thermal comfort at higher temperature can be improved with the use of ceiling fan.
