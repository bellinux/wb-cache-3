50|$|The railway in Parattah {{served as}} an {{important}} point on the Main line from Hobart to Launceston, being the halfway stopping point for the Tasman Limited, and the terminus for suburban and inter-regional passenger services on the Tasmanian Government Railways. Within the timetables, Parattah was allocated as a station where refreshments could be purchased, or where train, taxi or airplane connections could be arranged. Because of the high volume of traffic the station received, it was {{the location of a}} coaling stage and water refilling station for steam locomotives, a wye for turning locomotives around, as well as sidings and a <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> for freight and goods traffic.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear model predictive control scheme {{for the two}} main axes of an overhead travelling crane, which guarantees both tracking of desired trajectories for the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> and an active damping of <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> oscillations. The main idea of the used NMPC algorithm consists in a minimization of the tracking error {{at the end of}} the prediction horizon. That way the computation load can be kept relatively small. The varying length of the rope is considered by gain-scheduling techniques. The position of the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> is measured by a CMOS camera using the spatial filtering principle. Desired trajectories for the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> position in the three-dimensional workspace can be tracked independently with high accuracy. Experimental results from an implementation on a test rig show a high control performance...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{bulkiness}} of the ammunition, only 14 rounds {{could be}} carried, of {{which one was}} already loaded, with another in the loading tray. The rest were carried in two storage racks. To help with the loading of ammunition into the vehicle, a <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> was fitted {{at the rear of}} the superstructure next to the loading hatch. Even then, the entire five man crew had to help with the loading.|$|E

50|$|Nome had no harbor for ships {{during the}} rush, only one for local boats. Ships {{anchored}} offshore {{and people were}} shuttled ashore in boats. In early summer the coast could still be covered with ice. In that case passengers would be put off {{on the ice and}} brought ashore by dog sledges. In 1901 a <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> was built and in 1905 a wharf. This was by 1907 replaced by or combined with a tramway. Together with the tramway, which was 1,400 feet long, people and freight were brought ashore by wire-pulled lighters.|$|E

It has an extended bed and is used to supply the combat units with mass consumables like ammunition and fuel. Between 1976 and 1985, MAN built two versions. Type 454 only had a 5-ton winch by Rotzler and depended on fork lift trucks and the like. The type 464 had a 1-ton <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> by Atlas-Weyhausen, mounted {{in the middle of the}} bed to the left. Because of the crane, this type can only carry nine EUR-pallets.|$|E
5000|$|R-14 — under acting {{command of}} Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas - {{ran out of}} usable fuel and lost radio {{communications}} in May 1921 while on a surface search mission for the seagoing tug [...] about [...] southeast of the island of Hawaii. Since the submarine's electric motors {{did not have enough}} battery power to propel her to Hawaii, the ship's engineering officer Roy Trent Gallemore came up with a novel solution to their problem. Lieutenant Gallemore decided they could try to sail the boat to the port of Hilo, Hawaii. He therefore ordered a foresail made of eight hammocks hung from a top boom made of pipe bunk frames lashed firmly together, all tied to the vertical kingpost of the torpedo <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> forward of the submarine's superstructure. Seeing that this gave R-14 a speed of about 1 kn, as well as rudder control, he ordered a mainsail made of six blankets, hung from the sturdy radio mast (top sail in photo). This added [...]5 kn to the speed. He then ordered a mizzen made of eight blankets hung from another top boom made of bunk frames, all tied to the vertically placed boom of the torpedo <b>loading</b> <b>crane.</b> This sail added another [...]5 kn. Around 12:30 pm on 12 May, Gallemore was able to begin charging the boat's batteries. [...] After 64 hours under sail at slightly varying speeds, R-14 entered Hilo Harbor under battery propulsion on the morning of 15 May 1921. Douglas received a letter of commendation for the crew's innovative actions from his Submarine Division Commander, CDR Chester W. Nimitz, USN.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the lifting}} of the entire track, the MVR has {{physically}} survived well. The section between Knowle Junction and the West Meon Viaduct is now an 11 mi bridleway (rail trail), the Meon Valley Trail. On this section, all bridges, embankments and cuttings are intact and serviceable, except for two minor bridges north of Droxford which were removed in the 1960s to allow farm traffic to use the lanes they crossed. Along this part of the line, there are still occasional remains of trackside huts, signal posts and telegraph lines. At Mislingford Goods Yard, sleepers are still in the ground, a concrete loading gauge remains in place and the cast iron base of the <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> still stands next to the remains of a {{what appears to be a}} wagon.|$|E
5000|$|The station, {{which is}} located at line-kilometre 98.23 of the Dresden-Werdau railway, was opened on 15 November 1858. At first, the station was in neither Hohenstein nor Ernstthal, but in Oberlungwitz in the {{district}} of Abtei. The station site was later purchased by Hohenstein. From 1860 to 1887, the Hohenstein post office was located in the station building. In 1913, the station included 13 tracks. From 17 March 1913 to 26 March 1960, the station forecourt was the starting point of the Hohenstein-Ernstthal-Oelsnitz Tramway. The freight traffic of the tramway was handled next to the freight yard and two loading tracks, a transhipment track, a wooden transhipment hall with a <b>loading</b> <b>crane</b> and a siding to the freight shed were built. Until the summer timetable change on 30 May 1976, the so-called Stadt- und Vorortbahnverkehr ("urban and suburban railway service", an S-Bahn-like system) operated between Hohenstein-Ernstthal and Flöha.|$|E
50|$|Verwood {{station was}} 14 miles and 38 chains from Alderbury Junction, {{some way to}} the west of the village on the B3081. This crossed the line on an over-bridge just to the north of the station. The station {{consisted}} of a passing loop with two platforms plus goods facilities. The up platform was used in both directions when ths signalbox was closed. When the signalbox was open there were two single line sections West Moors to Verwood and Verwood to Fordingbridge, operated by Tylers No 6 tablets, when shut the two token were locked away behind the lever frame (lever 11 was the section locking lever) and a long section staff was withdrawn for a section from West Moors to Fordingbridge. The main station building was a single-storey, double gabled brick building, with platform canopy, on the up platform. Next to it was the LSWR Type 1 signal box and beyond that a parcels store. On the down platform was a timber shelter. At the southern end of the down platform a ground frame was located, this had to be operated for the passage of all down trains when the signalbox was open, it also was required for access to the sidings. In the station yard was the Albion Hotel. The goods yard was at the southern end of the up platform and consisted of a number of sidings, some serving the nearby brick works. A single siding ran between a cattle loading dock and the up platform. Verwood was the only station, other than Fordingbridge, to be equipped with a <b>loading</b> <b>crane.</b> In the later years that the station was open timber for various railway works was forward to the works after being loaded by the hand crane. The Albion Hotel (now the Albion Inn) and the road bridge are the only remaining structures with the road being rerouted across the station site.|$|E

The main crane pedestal, which is the supporting structure of the crane on the main deck of the vessel, is always under high level loads when the ship is in operation condition. In this paper, the structural strength analysis of main crane pedestal of the jack-up wind turbine installation vessel was presented. The direct calculated method was used to evaluate the strength of the main crane pedestal. The FE model of main crane pedestal was established with refined mesh, and the adjoining hull structure was also modeled to provide accurate boundary condition. Considering the permanent <b>loads,</b> variable <b>loads</b> (<b>crane</b> <b>loads)</b> and wind loads on the pedestal, the load combinations were defined for the ultimate limit state for every 45 degree. The deformation and stress of the pedestal and the hull structures were calculated and checked. The results showed that all stress results were within the maximum allowable stresses. The critical areas are often located at the link region of hull and pedestal...|$|R
