5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrester.</b> Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
25|$|In {{telegraphy}} and telephony, a <b>lightning</b> <b>arrester</b> is {{a device}} placed where wires enter a structure, {{in order to}} prevent damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near the structures. Lightning arresters, also called surge protectors, are devices that are connected between each electrical conductor in a power or communications system, and the ground. They help prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high-voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Arresters are used to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{that aims to}} detect and diagnosis faults in <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters,</b> using the thermovision technique. Thermovision is a non-destructive technique used in diverse services of maintenance, having the advantage not to demand the disconnection of the equipment under inspection. It uses a set of neuro-fuzzy networks to achieve the <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> fault classification. The methodology also uses a digital image processing algorithm based on the Watershed Transform {{in order to get}} the segmentation of the <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters.</b> This procedure enables the automatic search of the maximum and minimum temperature on the <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters.</b> These variables are necessary to generate the diagnosis. By appling the methodology is possible to classify <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> operative condition in: faulty, normal, light, suspicious and faulty. The computacional system generated by the proposed methodology train its neuro-fuzzy network by using a historical thermovision data. During the train phase, a heuristic is proposed in order to set the number of networks in the diagnosis system. This system was validated using a database provided by the Eletric Energy Research Center, with a hundreds of different faulty scenaries. The validation error of the set of neuro-fuzzy and the automatic digital thermovision imagem processing was about 10 percent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} how the lightning strikes and their effects on power distribution systems can be modeled, where the results give {{a clear picture of}} how to eliminate the devastating impact, caused by lightning, by using <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters.</b> The program ATP-Draw (Alternative Transient Program) was used to simulate the problem and was applied on a part of a power network. The simulation was done once when the lightning strikes a transmission line and a substation with no <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> in use and once more with their use. The source of the lightning was represented by the ATP models (Type- 15 surge function and Type- 13 ramp function) and the surge arrester was represented by the MOV-Type 92 component. The voltage was recorded at the substation 110 / 22 kV and at all loads in the electric network, and was drawn by the PlotXWin program. The results obtained indicate that the voltages induced by the lightning can reach values of the order of millions over insulation flashover levels for 22 kV equipment, where is clearly seen in Fig. 12 to 16 and Tab. 10, which requires the installation of <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> in electric power systems.

5000|$|A {{potential}} {{target for}} a lightning strike, {{such as a}} television antenna, {{is attached to the}} terminal labeled A in the photograph. Terminal E is attached to a long rod buried in the ground. Ordinarily no current will flow between the antenna and the ground because there is extremely high resistance between B and C, and also between C and D. The voltage of a lightning strike, however, is many times higher than that needed to move electrons through the two air gaps. The result is that electrons go through the <b>lightning</b> <b>arrester</b> rather than traveling on to the television set and destroying it.|$|E

Other designs of lightning arresters use a glow-discharge tube (essentially like a neon glow lamp) connected between the protected conductor and ground, or voltage-activated solid-state switches called varistors or MOVs.|$|E
