5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A <b>light-year</b> is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 <b>light-year</b> diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} <b>light-year.</b>|$|E

Their nature is unclear as to whether they are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive globular cluster. Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of globular clusters in M87.|$|E
5|$|There are {{relatively}} few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, {{which is about}} 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair {{at a distance of}} 0.2 <b>light-year.</b> In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun. The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9ly), Wolf 359 (7.8ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3ly).|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{published}} red shift, (Hubble Constant of 62 km/s per Mpc) a rough distance estimate for NGC 1055 is 52 million <b>light-years,</b> with {{a diameter of}} about 115,800 <b>light-years.</b> The separation between NGC 1055 and M77 is about 442,000 <b>light-years.</b>|$|R
50|$|NGC 4559 (also {{known as}} Caldwell 36) is an {{intermediate}} spiral galaxy {{with a weak}} inner ring structure in the constellation Coma Berenices.

25|$|Distances {{expressed}} in <b>light-years</b> include those between {{stars in the}} same general area, such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster. Galaxies themselves span from a few thousand to {{a few hundred thousand}} <b>light-years</b> in diameter, and are separated from neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters by millions of <b>light-years.</b> Distances to objects such as quasars and the Sloan Great Wall run up into the billions of <b>light-years.</b>|$|R
25|$|The fastest outward-bound {{spacecraft}} yet sent, Voyager 1, {{has covered}} 1/600th of a <b>light-year</b> in 30 {{years and is}} currently moving at 1/18,000th the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The <b>light-year</b> is {{most often}} used when expressing {{distances}} to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications. The unit usually used in professional astrometry is the parsec (symbol: pc, about 3.26 light-years; the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc).|$|E
25|$|Fomalhaut {{traditionally}} {{represents the}} mouth of the fish. Its companion Fomalhaut b was thought to be the first extrasolar planet ever detected by a visible light image, thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope, but infrared observations have since retracted this claim: it is instead a spherical cloud of dust. TW Piscis Austrini can be seen close by and is possibly associated with Fomalhaut as it lies within a <b>light-year</b> of it. Of magnitude 6.5, it is a BY Draconis variable.|$|E

25|$|In June 1983, Valdes and Freitas {{used the}} 26 m radiotelescope at Hat Creek Radio Observatory {{to search for}} the tritium hyperfine line at 1516MHz from 108 {{assorted}} astronomical objects, with emphasis on 53 nearby stars including all visible stars within a 20 <b>light-year</b> radius. The tritium frequency was deemed highly attractive for SETI work because (1) the isotope is cosmically rare, (2) the tritium hyperfine line is centered in the SETI waterhole region of the terrestrial microwave window, and (3) in addition to beacon signals, tritium hyperfine emission may occur as a byproduct of extensive nuclear fusion energy production by extraterrestrial civilizations. The wideband- and narrowband-channel observations achieved sensitivities of 5–14 x 10−21 W/m²/channel and 0.7-2 x 10−24 W/m²/channel, respectively, but no detections were made.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{unit was}} likely first {{suggested}} in 1913 by the British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner. Named as a portmanteau of the parallax of one arcsecond, it was defined {{so as to}} make calculations of astronomical distances quick and easy for astronomers from only their raw observational data. Partly for this reason, it is still the unit preferred in astronomy and astrophysics, though the <b>light-year</b> remains prominent in popular science texts and common usage. Although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within the Milky Way, multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe, including kiloparsecs (kpc) for the more distant objects within and around the Milky Way, megaparsecs (Mpc) for all but the closest galaxies, and gigaparsecs (Gpc) for many quasars and the most distant galaxies.|$|E
25|$|If a {{spaceship}} travels to a planet one <b>light-year</b> (as {{measured in the}} Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be {{less than one year}} as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a proper velocity. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth {{at the same time as}} the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.|$|E

500|$|In {{their paper}} announcing the {{discovery}} of Sedna, Mike Brown and his colleagues described it as the first observed body belonging to the Oort cloud, the hypothetical cloud of comets thought to exist nearly a <b>light-year</b> from the Sun. They observed that, unlike scattered disc objects such as Eris, Sedna's perihelion (76AU) is too distant for it to have been scattered by the gravitational influence of Neptune. Because {{it is a great}} deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the planetoid as being an [...] "inner Oort cloud object", situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.|$|E
500|$|The Sun orbits {{the center}} of the Milky Way, and it is {{presently}} moving {{in the direction of the}} constellation of Cygnus. The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is [...] roughly elliptical with orbital perturbations due to the non-uniform mass distribution in Milky Way, such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms. In addition, the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. It has been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on Earth, perhaps due to increased impact events. It takes the Solar System about 225–250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a galactic year), so it is thought to have completed 20–25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun. The orbital speed of the Solar System about {{the center of}} the Milky Way is approximately 251km/s (156mi/s). At this speed, it takes around 1,190 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 <b>light-year,</b> or 7 days to travel 1 AU.|$|E
