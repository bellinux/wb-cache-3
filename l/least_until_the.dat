5|$|As Christianity {{became the}} {{dominant}} religion, Attic {{began to be}} used in Christian writings in addition to and often interspersed with koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 12th century, Attic remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods.|$|E
5|$|Brampton Manor {{probably}} {{stood on}} the site of the New Road Industrial Estate. After the manor was destroyed the site was known as Brampton Field, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 18th Century, and indeed one of the streets of the housing estate which covers the site today is named Brampton Field.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance {{in terms of}} both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.|$|E

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E
5|$|The British thus {{gained a}} respite, and peace lasted at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> time Gildas was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, {{from around the}} end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth. Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of {{southern}} England was {{under the control of the}} continental invaders.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|As far as known, Oryzomys gorgasi has a disjunct {{distribution}} in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Curaçao. In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America. The Colombian population is {{known from the}} holotype only, caught at Loma Teguerre (7°54'N, 77°W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the Río Atrato, at about 1m above sea level. The location is apparently a freshwater swamp, and Hershkovitz suggested that O.gorgasi probably occurred throughout the swamp forests in the Río Atrato basin. On Curaçao, it is known from cave faunas at Tafelberg Santa Barbara, Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and Hermanus. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), indicating that the population persisted at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> first European contact in 1499.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, Neuner {{admitted}} {{struggling for}} {{motivation for the}} upcoming season, having won every title in the sport at only 23 years old. However, she vowed to continue her career at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 2012 world championships in Ruhpolding. In December 2010 she suffered from a cold, missing the season's first World Cup in Östersund {{for the second year}} in a row. She started the 2010–11 season in Hochfilzen, where she managed two seventh-place finishes, and was part of the winning German relay team. At the third stop of the season in Pokljuka, she won the sprint race in spite of two shooting errors, claiming her 20th career victory.|$|E

5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
5|$|Leonard died peacefully in Buxton on 25 November 1971, and his ashes {{were placed}} in St Paul's Church in Halifax on 17 September 1972. His memory lived on in the Royal Canadian Navy, where the Admiral L.W. Murray Trophy for Gunnery Proficiency was awarded {{annually}} at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s. Since his death, a number of commemorative steps have been taken, including the placing of a memorial in his honour in Pictou, a collection of his medals and related naval artifacts in the Canadian Naval Operations School (CFNOS) in Halifax, the naming of a Maritimes Branch of the Royal Canadian Naval Association, the renaming of Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps NEW GLASGOW in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia to Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps ADMIRAL MURRAY, and the naming of several naval buildings, including CFNOS building at CFB Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Old Trafford's {{most recent}} expansion, {{which took place}} between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an {{increase}} of around 8,000 seats {{with the addition of}} second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground. Part of the new seating was used {{for the first time on}} 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied. In 2009, a reorganisation of the seating in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 255 to 75,957, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> next expansion.|$|E

50|$|Liechtenstein ("bright stone") Castle is {{the origin}} of the name of the Liechtenstein family, the ruling house of the country of the same name, which owned the castle from at <b>least</b> 1140 <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 13th century and again from 1807 onwards.|$|R
5|$|Unas' most {{immediate}} legacy is his funerary cult, which continued at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time {{following the death of}} Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of Pepi II and the last one dates to {{the very end of the}} Old Kingdom (c. 2180 BC). The priests of the cult of Unas adopted basilophorous names, incorporating that of the king, possibly upon taking office.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} Menkauhor enjoyed a funerary cult {{centered}} on his pyramid complex. The cult lasted at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of}} the Sixth Dynasty, nearly 150 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in dedicated agricultural domains that were established during Menkauhor's lifetime. Products of these domains were delivered to Menkauhor's sun and mortuary temples and distributed to the priests of the cult, who could use them for their sustenance or their own funerary cults. Personified representations of Menkauhor's agricultural domains are depicted bringing offerings {{on the walls of the}} mastabas of these priests. Most of the depictions are located in Saqqara North, near the pyramid complex of Djoser. This area comprises the tombs of Neferiretptah, Raemankh, Duare, Iti, Sekhemnefer, Snofrunefer, Akhethotep, Ptahhotep and Qednes, all priests of the funerary cult of Menkauhor. Further tombs of priests of this cult are found to the north, in Abusir South, with the mastaba of Isesiseneb and Rahotep and in Giza.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{administration}} of Harry Truman had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, at <b>least</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of {{the threat posed by}} Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission {{to go ahead with the}} plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan.|$|E
