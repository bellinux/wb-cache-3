50|$|The {{legal system}} places {{varying degrees of}} {{limitation}} on self-help, and laws vary widely among different jurisdictions. Often, self-help will be allowed as long as no law is broken, and no breach of the peace occurs (or is likely to occur). Also, the usual <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> for actions of an agent will not apply; if one uses an agent such as an independent contractor to perform the self-help action, the principal will be held strictly liable if anything goes wrong. Courts will often place stricter limits on repossession of certain types of merchandise and on eviction of tenants. Creditors and landlords who resort to self-help in such situations are prone to tort liability, and in some jurisdictions, to criminal liability.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has triggered a renewed emphasis on corporate directors’ duty to exercise oversight. In {{contrast to the}} area of discrete decision-making, where academics only rarely dispute the board’s almost complete insulation from liability, there is considerable resistance to the idea that oversight should be subject to equally strict limits to hold directors responsible. Yet, Delaware courts {{have made it clear that}} they continue to severely limit, and not expand, directors’ oversight liability, leading Delaware in the opposite direction than that which many of its critics would advocate. Both policy and theoretical considerations, however, support Delaware’s decision to maintain strict <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> oversight <b>liability.</b> Such restraints protect directors’ ability to exercise independent business judgment, encourage risk taking and board service by qualified individuals, and prevent directors from assuming the role as insurers of business risks. In addition, <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> oversight <b>liability</b> reduce monitoring costs and promote efficient functioning of boards. Thus, as this Article argues, Delaware’s current solution works and strikes the correct balance between directors’ accountability and authority. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

40|$|Over {{a decade}} ago, the Federal Judicial Conference warned of an {{asbestos}} litigation “disaster of major proportions. ” The Supreme Court of the United States {{has described the}} litigation as a “crisis. ” According the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, {{by the end of}} 2000, more than 600, 000 asbestos claims were filed. RAND estimates that as many as three million more plaintiffs may eventually file claims. Most new claimants are not sick. The flood of claims has forced almost sixty companies into bankruptcy; many of these bankruptcies are very recent. As a result, defendants with only remote connections to asbestos – known as peripheral defendants – are being dragged into the litigation. Some of these companies have also begun to declare bankruptcy. Experts predict that, absent meaningful reform, asbestos cases may continue to be a major legal and public policy problem for decades to come. In this Article, Professor Cupp argues that courts and legislatures should impose ad hoc public policy limitations <b>on</b> joint <b>liability</b> in asbestos and other appropriate cases. The Article analyzes holdings that support asbestos-specific <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> joint <b>liability,</b> and explains why unlimited and unrestrained joint liability represents unsound public policy in the current asbestos litigation environment.

40|$|Limited {{liability}} {{has been}} known in Europe {{since at least the}} twelfth century, and developed later in England and throughout the developed world. Limited liability can be achieved by private contractual arrangements, by the use of limited liability forms of enterprise, by other statutory <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability,</b> and by bankruptcy. The principal advantage of limited liability is in encouraging investment by passive investors in risky enterprises, particularly where these investors are poor monitors of managers. Joint and several liability is a particular deterrent to investment by wealthy investors, who are likely to bear all of the costs of judgment. Pro rata liability shifts collection costs from wealth investors who must seek contribution from other investors to judgment creditors, who must collect from all investors if they are to recover the entire judgment. It is generally agreed that in the context of contractual liability, the costs of <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>on</b> contract creditors will be fully internalized, as the cost of credit rises to reflect increased risk of firm bankruptcy shifted to these creditors. Determining the efficient rule in the context of tort liability is much more complex. While it is generally true that limited liability allows firms to become judgment proof and frustrate tort creditor recovery, this is only the beginning of the inquiry. First, tort creditors may benefit from efforts of contract creditors to minimize firm risk. Second, {{it is not clear that}} unlimited liability would deter risky firm activities if widely dispersed shareholders are poor monitors of risky firm activities, or if many tort liabilities are uncertain in their incidence and extent of harm. Third, it is not clear that shareholders are necessarily the superior risk-bearers where mass torts involve class actions where each claim is relatively small, if some shareholders would bear a large amount of liability.

25|$|The {{common law}} of privity of {{contract}} is a sub-rule of consideration because it restricts who can enforce an agreement {{to those who have}} brought consideration to the bargain. In an early case, Tweddle v Atkinson, it was held that because a son had not given any consideration for his father in law's promise to his father to pay the son £200, he could not enforce the promise. Given the principle that standing to enforce an obligation should reflect whoever has a legitimate interest in its performance, a 1996 report by the Law Commission entitled Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties, recommended that while courts should be left free to develop the common law, some of the more glaring injustices should be removed. This led to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Under section 1, a third party may enforce an agreement if it purports to confer a benefit on the third party, either individually or a member as a class, and there is no expressed stipulation that the person was not intended to be able to enforce it. In this respect there is a strong burden on the party claiming enforcement was not intended by a third party. A third party has the same remedies available as a person privy to an agreement, and can enforce both positive benefits, or <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability,</b> such as an exclusion clause. The rights of a third party can then only be terminated or withdrawn without her consent if it is reasonably foreseeable that she would rely upon them.|$|R

It predicts that both quits and discharges are negatively correlated with the steepness of the age-earning profile. The discharge prediction is contrary to a job matching or pure human capital model. The predictions of the model are tested on a sample of firms from the Belgian manufacturing sector. We find that 1) the dispersion of pay policy across firms is similar in Belgium and the U. S., 2) this dispersion does not reflect simple rent-sharing or omitted variables, 3) about 8 % of workers separate annually with discharges concentrated in the first years, and 4) steeper seniority profiles are associated with lower quit and discharge rates. ...|$|R
