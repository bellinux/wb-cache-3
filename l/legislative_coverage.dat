40|$|Background: The {{pharmaceutical}} security {{can only}} be ensured taking into account its multidimensional and systemic character; the partial or one-sided approach will not ensure the feasibility and the sustainability of such security. A major condition to ensure pharmaceutical safety is {{the existence of a}} legislative base. The purpose of the paper is to highlight regulatory gaps affecting the pharmaceutical security of the Republic of Moldova. Material and methods: Based on a logical analysis, all conditions, the compliance with which would ensure the pharmaceutical security of the state and of each citizen were determined. The existence or absence of legal provisions legalizing the application of various ways, methods, processes, procedures, regulations and other measures that would impose compliance with pharmaceutical security conditions was highlighted. The level of <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> of the requirements for the provision of pharmaceutical security was determined. The quantification scale regarding the level of <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> for the provision of pharmaceutical security was developed. Results: The research resulted {{in the development of the}} methodical toolbox by means of which the <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> level of the pharmaceutical security was identified. The calculations demonstrated that the legislation of the Republic of Moldova does not sufficiently cover the pharmaceutical security. This fact refers mostly to the insufficient regulation of the good quality of pharmaceutical services, of the proper functioning of the entire pharmaceutical system and of ensuring physical and economic availability of drugs. Conclusions: The impact of the governmental factor in the Republic of Moldova concerning certain aspects of the pharmaceutical security was highlighted. The toolbox of methods for the analysis of the level of <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> of pharmaceutical security was drawn up...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{shown in}} the Presidential Architecture Commission’s Report for 2009, Romania’s natural and {{man-made}} heritage is in a permanent state of destructive aggression. Disappearance of national heritage due to negligence or destruction is becoming a more frequent phenomenon and reflects a process contrary to sustainable development. Protected areas and historic city centers are under attack by real estate speculation and poorly planned short-term development projects. Decentralization of responsibilities to local authorities was made without providing adequate measures and tools for heritage protection under the law. A major lack of <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> allows circumvention {{of the law in}} many cases, interpretation of the law in bad faith, abusive or incompetent application of the law, encouraging abuse and illegality. The main purpose of this research is to provide detailed information about the “Regional Cultural Project ” for local and regional decision-makers {{to be used in the}} process of local economic development planning. This concept successfully employed by the public authorities throughout Europe, is completely unknown in Romania. In Romanian public administration schools, the curriculum does not comprise disciplines such as “cultural heritage law”and it fails to offer interdisciplinary perspectives towards the study of territorial cultural heritage...|$|E

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{comprehensive}} guide to the development and utilization of authorial moral rights across the key jurisdictions of the English-speaking world and in France and Germany. In recent years, the copyright statutes of the common law countries have been expanded {{by the introduction of}} provisions dealing with purely authorial rights - moral rights. The Moral Rights of Authors and Performers discusses the historical development of the rights in Europe, with particular reference to France and Germany, and shows the growth of moral rights theory and <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> up to the late 1930 s. During the 1920 s the moral rights of authors became the subject of international protection, particularly through the operation of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The book explores the adoption of moral rights into this and other international instruments, explaining the functions that moral rights were intended to perform. The author gives detailed accounts of the operation of moral rights in France and Germany today, addressing both statutory interpretation and doctrinal issues. The provision of case studies gives an impression of the rich jurisprudence associated with the rights in these countries. The book also contains a detailed discussion of the versions of moral rights that have become entrenched in Canada, the UK, the US and Australia, with each country considered independently. It deals separately with the introduction of the rights into each country and their operation and interpretation by courts and commentators. Material on common law analogues to the rights is provided, which indicates alternative actions that practitioners might take. Problems of cross-jurisdictional legal proceedings (especially arising from technological transfer of information) are also addressed, with moral rights protection elsewhere in the world summarized in tabular form. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} high {{strength}} concrete mixtures were {{designed in the}} 1970 s, {{a lot of research}} is performed. Despite the recommendations that were written, full <b>legislative</b> <b>coverage</b> of high strength concrete remained unavailable. The new Eurocodes are also valid for high strength concrete, so the question rises how high strength concrete can be used in the civil engineering sector. This Master’s thesis is therefore aimed at the question which (combinations of) cross sections can be used to create an optimal design for cast in situ high strength concrete bridges. From a consideration of the dominant loads on a concrete plate bridge, it followed that for bending moments the governing cross section is required over a small length of the entire bridge. This also applies to shear forces. It was also found that the self weight of the bridge forms {{a large part of the}} total load on the bridge. Research into the optimal cross section for the three main actions (normal force, bending moment and shear force) learned that for normal and shear forces solid cross sections are optimal. For bending moments on the other hand, I profiles perform best since the material is concentrated at the top and bottom of the cross section. Attempts to improve the performance by including a high strength concrete in a normal strength concrete cross section yielded little success, mainly due to the small difference in stiffness between both materials. Both investigations lead to the development of two strategies for optimisation of the solid, flat plate bridge. The first strategy is to vary the cross sectional height along the length of the bridge. This reduces the bending moment capacity at the locations where the maximum capacity is not required. The other method is to apply the optimal cross sections at the positions where the demand for the corresponding capacity is large. Using the I section at positions where bending moment capacity is required yields a plate with rectangular voids in longitudinal direction. After the benchmark design (the solid flat plate) is optimised, the designs for each strategy were optimised as well. During the optimisation process, as much material as possible is removed while maintaining the designed shapes, until the first structural check failed. The optimal variant that scored best was a one metre high plate with 20 voids. Compared with the initial cross sectional area of the bridge, 33 % is replaced by voids. When comparing the cross sectional area with the benchmark design, the reduction is almost 40 %. Due to the reduction of the plate thickness by 100 millimetres, the span to plate thickness ratio is increased from 35 (rule of thumb) to 42. During the tender process the durability and sustainability of designs becomes more important. Hence the MKI method as used in Rijkswaterstaat’s DuboCalc software is used in order to assess the environmental impact of the various designs. This method incorporates a number of environmental factors and translates this to environmental costs for each construction material (MKI value). Compared with the benchmark design, the optimised design reduces the MKI value by 37 %. Structural and Building EngineeringDesign and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to extricate}} {{the construction of}} Kompas toward news <b>coverage</b> of woman <b>legislative</b> candidate in Legislative Election 2009. Albeit reformation has been occurred since 12 years ago, the relation of woman and politic is still clashed and debated in economic, politic, social, culture and religion contexts. Woman often placed as marginalized human in politic. The terms of ‘public domain’ and ‘private domain’ are a dichotomy which explain role of man and woman in society. Woman is hitherto only involved in internal household. Socio culturally, woman is positioned as inferior party, in famous Javanese philosophy {{it is said that}} woman is confined as ‘konco wingking’ (friend in kitchen). Since Independen day of Indonesia in 1945, the number of woman in legislative board has not been representative compared with the total woman population in Indonesia. Based on the phenomena, this research is proposed to examine central issues which reported by Kompas consistently. As a media industry, Kompas Daily Newspaper is intentionally selected as the research subject caught with the news coverage which nationally based and dominate circulation. In sociocultural area, Kompas often offer ideas and discourse which then contribute an influence to society. This research will simultaneously disclose central issues which reported by Kompas consistently in woman <b>legislative</b> candidate news <b>coverage</b> in <b>legislative</b> election 2009. The method used in this research is framing method. Framing devices which will be applied is Gamson and Modigliani’s which consists of framing devices and reasoning devices. Framing devices is caught directly to central issues which stressed in a news. This devices is simbolized with words using, sentences using, graphic or picture, and certain metaphor. Reasoning devices is regarded cohesion and coherence of media text which refer to certain notion so message can be received as truth, natural, and real.

"July 2011 "This dissertation explores the market reaction to analyst coverage initiations and the factors leading to coverage initiations by analysts for newly public banking stocks. I use two cases to investigate the timeliness and reaction to analyst coverage initiations. The first case serves as a means to examine how the difference in the information environment affects analyst coverage using the expiration of the quiet period to judge analyst behavior for banks. The second case allows me to look longitudinally at analyst coverage initiations and examine the factors that influence the time until coverage is initiated and if the market reacts differently to coverage with more elapsed time between the expiration of the quiet period and the first initiation of analyst coverage. For the first case, I find that analyst coverage is initiated for 15 percent of banks {{at the end of the}} quiet period and those banks experience five-day aggregate returns of - 43 basis points versus 11 basis points for banks without analyst coverage initiations. Contrary to prior research, I find that underpricing is not indicative of analyst coverage. As the number of operational activities for banks increase with <b>legislative</b> changes, analyst <b>coverage</b> increases. For the second case, I find that banks with either high insider ownership after the IPO, lower leverage after the IPO, or larger size tend to have earlier coverage initiations. Banks with stock prices deviating from fundamental value do not have a strong tendency to have rapid analyst coverage following the expiration of the quiet period. However, the evidence suggests that extreme deviation from fundamental value increases the time until analyst coverage is initiated. I find that, while the cumulative aggregate returns for banks when analysts initiate coverage is negative, there is no indication that the market is more informed by the initiation of coverage...|$|R
