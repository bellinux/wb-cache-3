This paper aims at revisiting this competitive âbattleâ. Through a case-based design in a âmultinationalâ domestic market that seems to favour MNEs, we explore how <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> respond to MNEsâ purported superiority.

Therefore, resource-accessing strategies spearheaded by <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> suggest that ownership advantages should not be inherently translated into competitive advantages for the MNEs.

TI was disentangled into the categories of human resource (HR), process technology (PT) and R&D (RD) intensities, and the differences between foreign and <b>local</b> <b>firms.</b> The results show that firms in Korea and Taiwan endowed with superior NS enjoy significantly higher skill intensity, TI and RD than firms in Malaysia and Thailand, which have inferior NS. There were no obvious differences in HR practices between foreign and <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> in the four countries. <b>Local</b> <b>firms</b> enjoyed higher TI and RD than foreign firms in Taiwan. There was no statistical difference involving all the technological categories between foreign and <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> in Korea.

A <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodworkâand still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E

Third, we use qualitative analyses and firm survey data from a Guangzhou software cluster to show that global knowledge linkages and local knowledge networks are of similar importance to the innovation of <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> in a cluster, especially for <b>local</b> innovative <b>firms.</b> Customers, competitors, consultants and new personnel are the four most important knowledge sources to the innovation of <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> from both <b>local</b> knowledge networks and global knowledge linkages.
