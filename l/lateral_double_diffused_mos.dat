To predict aging of circuit performance, tested models for device parameters are needed in which the change in device behavior as function of time, given the biasing and temperature condition of the device in the circuit, is correctly modeled. The time scale here is the lifetime of the product. A circuit simulator in the transient mode can predict circuit aging using a transformation of the dc/ac biasing situation with an appropriate scaling mechanism. Device aging models that can be implemented in such a circuit simulator are presented here for nMOS and DMOS (<b>double</b> <b>diffused</b> <b>MOS)</b> based on measurements and empirical modeling...|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a high-voltage transistor arrangement in CMOS technology. In order to reach a dielectric strength in excess of 20 volts, DMOS (<b>double</b> <b>diffused</b> <b>MOS)</b> technology is used in known high-voltage transistor arrangements in which both source and drain zones aer surrounded by drift zones {{by means of a}} two-stage diffusion of doping atoms. This technology requires a production process with additional process steps. In the arrangement according to the invention, only the drain zone is surrounded by a drift zone, whereas the source zone is embedded directly in the semiconductor substrate. This permits the manufacture of the arrangement with the exclusive use of process steps taken from standard CMOS technology and no additional process steps. The high-voltage transistor arrangement according to the invention, having a dielectric strength in excess of 50 volts and, in special versions, in excess of 100 volts, is specially designed for use in automobile engineering and indus trial plants...|$|R

40|$|This project {{serves as}} a study to {{determine}} the feasibility of the current CMOS toolsets and processes available at Semiconductor 2 ̆ 6 Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory (SMFL) for the fabrication of whole wafer power devices. Several designs and devices were explored. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (LGBT) is a device widely used for high power electronic applications and was selected for this study. This device has bipolar current flow and a MOS gate thus combining advantages of both the <b>Double</b> <b>diffused</b> <b>MOS</b> (DMOS) and Power Bipolar junction transistor.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{high voltage}} power transistor is a vertical device. That is, {{one in which}} the current flow is vertical. This construction technique has evolved from both physical reasons and the relative ease of construction of these devices. Whether the device is a Field Effect Transister (FET) or a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), this vertical current flow results in the substrate, that part of the silicon wafer on which the device is built, being the drain or the collector terminal. If it is wished to integrate circuitry to control the power device on the same chip, the fact that the substrate is a terminal which can change its potential as the load or device characteristics are varied, presents severe common mode problems. A lateral transistor, one in which all terminals are {{on the top of the}} chip and the resultant current flow is lateral to the top, can alleviate these problems to some extent. While this construction technique is not common, numerous examples of these devices exist in the literature. Generally these devices are either low voltage units or, for a given value of voltage/current capability, they use considerably more chip surface than a comparable vertical device. In this study, a new lateral device, The LAteral Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or LABFET, is described. This device replaces the normal n+-drain diffusion, used in the typical <b>Double</b> <b>Diffused</b> <b>MOS</b> (DMOS) transistor with a p-type diffusion. This p-diffusion acts as the emitter of a low gain p- n-p bipolar transistor. The base of this device is the n-substrate or n-well, when the device is part of an integrated circuit. The base current is supplied by turning on the DMOS Field Effect Transistor. The result is a conductivity modulated device, with all terminals on the top of the chip, a voltage withstand capability of 100 V and an on-staAte conductance of. 71 Siemans per cm of gate width. This is comparable with conventional vertical FET devices. The static and dynamic characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 Unit cell 2 ̆ 2 devices are presented with an explanation of the results and a description of the processing to produce them. Finally, suggestions are made which would allow the extension of this concept to a large device suitable for integration into a power integrated circuit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a compact model for sil-icon-on-insulator (SOI) {{laterally}} <b>double</b> <b>diffused</b> (LD) MOSFETs. The model is complete insofar as it uses no subcircuits, and is intended to predict device operation in all regions of bias. The device current is described by two main equations handling the MOS channel and the drift region, {{both of which are}} smooth and continuous in all operating regimes. Attention is also given to the modeling of inversion at the back oxide to ensure correct behavior is predicted for a source follower in power control applications (“high side operation”). A surface-potential-based formulation is used for the inversion/accumulation channel giving smooth transitions between different regions of operation, and care has been taken to ensure all expressions are smooth and infinitely differentiable to achieve the best possible convergence perfor-mance. Self (and coupled) heating effects exert a major influence over the behavior of power SOI devices, and these issues are incorporated in the model core in a consistent fashion. The model has been installed in a commercial SPICE-type circuit simulator and evaluated against individual devices and complete circuits fabricated in an industrial smart power SOI process. Accuracy is significantly improved with respect to the existing LDMOS models, and convergence behavior in switching and linear circuit simulations is comparable with industry standard models of this complexity.
