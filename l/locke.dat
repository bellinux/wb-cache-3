5|$|It is Day 8, September 29, 2004, and Charlie is {{suffering}} from heroin withdrawal since he voluntarily gave his heroin to John <b>Locke</b> (Terry O'Quinn) in the previous episode. After finding him, Charlie asks <b>Locke</b> for the heroin back, and <b>Locke</b> says that he'll give Charlie the drugs the third time he asks, because he wants Charlie to have the choice to quit.|$|E
5|$|John <b>Locke</b> (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company. He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning <b>Locke.</b> At one point <b>Locke</b> tells Randy off and feels great about it. He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she charges by the hour to talk with <b>Locke,</b> {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. <b>Locke</b> reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E

50|$|Spencer is <b>Locke's</b> partner, a seven-foot-tall {{imaginary}} talking panther. A psychological {{byproduct of}} <b>Locke's</b> harrowing childhood, Spencer acts as <b>Locke's</b> instincts as a detective, {{as well as}} his conscience, empathy, and desire to protect the innocent.|$|R
500|$|<b>Locke's</b> {{emphasis}} {{on the role of}} experience {{in the formation of the}} mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to <b>Locke's</b> philosophical theory, points out, this is [...] "one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke." [...] As both he and Tarcov highlight, <b>Locke's</b> writings are full of directives to [...] seek out knowledge actively and reflect on received opinion; in fact, this was the essence of <b>Locke's</b> challenge to innatism.|$|R
5|$|Later Hurley brings Jack and Charlie water, {{he notes}} Charlie doesn't look well but Jack covers for him {{saying that he}} has the flu. Hurley tells him to get better and Charlie looks thankful to Jack. He sees <b>Locke</b> and asks him for his heroin and <b>Locke</b> gives it back. Charlie looks at it for a moment before tossing it into the fire, smiling. <b>Locke</b> tells Charlie he's proud of him and that he always knew he could do it. Charlie and <b>Locke</b> see a moth flying away.|$|E
5|$|<b>Locke</b> {{finds the}} polar bear's cave and rescues Eko from the polar bear. While Charlie fetches {{water from a}} stream, <b>Locke</b> apologizes to an {{unconscious}} Eko for his lack of faith. Eko appears to briefly awaken and tells <b>Locke</b> that he must rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Upon arriving at camp, Hurley informs the camp that Jack and the others have been captured. As an explanation, <b>Locke</b> announces to the survivors {{that he plans to}} rescue Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, as Desmond indicated to Hurley earlier. Hurley mentions to Charlie a sense of déjà vu.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Kate {{return to}} camp, {{and when she}} goes to tell Jack about <b>Locke,</b> Jack sees {{a man in a}} suit walk into the jungle. Jack chases after him and Kate follows, but instead of the mysterious figure, they find <b>Locke,</b> who brings with him a dead boar. That night, the {{fuselage}} is burned while Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) holds a memorial service for the dead passengers using information she found in their passports, wallets, and luggage. Michael thanks <b>Locke</b> for hunting the boar and then asks <b>Locke</b> about the Monster, but <b>Locke</b> says that he did not see anything.

40|$|Berkeley's main aim in his {{well-known}} {{early works}} {{was to identify}} and refute "the grounds of Scepticism, Atheism, and irreligion. " This appears to place Berkeley within a well-established tradition of religious critics of <b>Locke's</b> epistemology, including, most famously, Stillingfleet. I argue that these appearances are deceiving. Berkeley is, in fact, in important respects an opponent of this tradition. According to Berkeley, <b>Locke's</b> earlier critics, including Stillingfleet, had misidentified the grounds of irreligion in <b>Locke's</b> philosophy while all the while endorsing the true grounds of irreligion themselves. <b>Locke's</b> epistemology is innocent; matter and abstraction are to blame...|$|R
5|$|When <b>Locke</b> {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets <b>Locke</b> to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected <b>Locke.</b> The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including <b>Locke.</b> After Ben regains consciousness and finds <b>Locke</b> to be alive, he convinces <b>Locke</b> he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. <b>Locke</b> travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and <b>Locke</b> travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so <b>Locke</b> leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill <b>Locke</b> again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow <b>Locke</b> and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where <b>Locke</b> gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever <b>Locke</b> asks, so <b>Locke</b> convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets <b>Locke</b> and observes <b>Locke</b> has found a loophole. It is revealed that <b>Locke</b> was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of <b>Locke.</b> Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E
5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and <b>Locke.</b> Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, <b>Locke</b> appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, <b>Locke</b> is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot <b>Locke</b> if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting <b>Locke</b> about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Boone informs <b>Locke</b> he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. <b>Locke</b> knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. <b>Locke</b> applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. <b>Locke</b> explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} there is a {{conflict}} between two principles informing <b>Locke’s</b> political philosophy, namely his waste restriction and his strong voluntarism. <b>Locke’s</b> waste restriction is proposed as a necessary, enforceable restriction upon rightful private property holdings and it yields arguments to preserve and redistribute natural resources. <b>Locke’s</b> strong voluntarism is proposed as the liberal ideal of political obligations. It expresses <b>Locke’s</b> view that each individual has a natural political power, which can only be transferred to a political body through the individual’s voluntary, actual consent. On this view, the legitimacy of a political power is dependent upon its subjects’ actual consent to its authority. After briefly outlining these two ideas informing <b>Locke’s</b> conception, I argue that we cannot maintain both at the same time. Therefore, contemporary Lockeans must either derive restrictions upon private property concerned with preserving natural resources from other aspects of <b>Locke’s</b> theory or they must accept weak voluntarism as the ideal of political obligations. I argue that both alternatives pose significant problems for the Lockean project...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I compare John <b>Locke’s</b> and Murray N. Rothbard’s {{theories}} of property. The main aim of that comparison {{is to show}} that <b>Locke’s</b> theory of property, which seems to be crucial for contemporary libertarians, cannot be the foundation for the libertarian theory. The corollary is that <b>Locke’s</b> theory, resp. classical liberalism, cannot be – as many, including M. N. Rothbard, the main proponent of libertarianism, claim – the source of libertarianism in a strict sense...|$|R
40|$|Although Alain <b>Locke’s</b> {{works are}} well known, they have rarely been {{assessed}} for their direct significance as political theory. In this article, the author undertakes such an assessment by exposing {{the political implications}} of <b>Locke’s</b> formulations on race in a number of lectures he conducted in 1916. Specifically, this article shows that although <b>Locke’s</b> works have been interpreted as advocating a critical pragmatism on race, they put forth a new kind of racialism that is neither critical nor conservative, although decidedly radical. Exposing this makes it easier to see the connection between <b>Locke’s</b> works and the earlier thinkers on race before the European Enlightenment as well as ways in which they anticipate important trends in contemporary political thought...|$|R
5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill <b>Locke,</b> screaming that he had killed his sister, but <b>Locke</b> reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to <b>Locke,</b> is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. <b>Locke</b> says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|<b>Locke</b> {{wrote the}} letters that would {{eventually}} become Some Thoughts for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles allowed commoners to think they could acquire {{the same kind of}} character as the aristocrats for whom <b>Locke</b> originally intended the work.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contrasts}} Nicholas Barbon's and John <b>Locke's</b> positions, in the 1690 's English monetary {{debates about}} raising the money. Although Barbon's and <b>Locke's</b> arguments {{were referred to}} the English monetary setting of the 1690 's, {{it can be argued}} that the issues pointed at and the theoretical achievements of the debates were instrumental to the constitution of monetary economics and of economic theory itself, a process unfolded in the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century. <b>Locke's</b> theory, in special, stood as a benchmark to monetary theory for a 150 years long period. The text follows Barbon's review of <b>Locke's</b> position on monetary issues, and tries to make an assessment of both authors contributions to monetary economics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Locke's</b> {{second book}} of poems {{contains}} two named poems The Motel (4 parts) and the much longer Home Territory (45 parts).

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in <b>Locke’s</b> theory was that the Aboriginals were underdeveloped and were living in simply organized societies based on a self-sufficient economy which could not produce any extra profit. In other words, in <b>Locke’s</b> view there existed two economic worlds – one European which had a potential for making profit, and one aboriginal, mainly connected with a barter economy. The research focus is the attempt to deny <b>Locke’s</b> myth about aboriginal economies {{at the time of}} the first contact with European colonizers...|$|R
5|$|On the island, Jack and Sawyer {{meet up with}} Hurley and <b>Locke</b> at the Orchid station.

At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with <b>Locke.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Locke's</b> Some Thoughts Concerning Education was {{a runaway}} best-seller. During {{the eighteenth century}} alone, Some Thoughts was {{published}} in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included <b>Locke's</b> educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. <b>Locke's</b> imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.|$|R
500|$|Along with Rousseau's [...] (1762), <b>Locke's</b> Some Thoughts Concerning Education {{was one of}} the {{foundational}} eighteenth-century texts on educational theory.
