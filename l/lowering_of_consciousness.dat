40|$|The first {{national}} guideline on palliative sedation in The Netherlands {{has been adopted}} by the General Board of the Royal Dutch Medical Association. By law, the physician is obliged to take this guideline into consideration. In this paper, we present the main principles of the guideline. Palliative sedation {{is defined as the}} intentional <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> of a patient in the last phase of his or her life. The aim of palliative sedation is to relieve suffering, and lowering consciousness is a means to achieve this. The indication for palliative sedation is the presence of one or more refractory symptoms that lead to unbearable suffering for the patient. Palliative sedation is given to improve patient comfort. It is the degree of symptom control, not the level to which consciousness is lowered, which determines the dose and the combinations of the sedatives used and duration of treatment. Palliative sedation is normal medical practice and must be clearly distinguished from the termination of lif...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Palliative sedation, the {{intentional}} <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> for refractory and unbearable distress, {{has been much}} discussed during the last decade. In recent years, much research has been published about this subject that {{will be discussed in}} this review. The review concentrates on: a brief overview of the main developments during the last decade, an exploration of current debate regarding ethical dilemmas, the development of clinical guidelines, and the application of palliative sedation. RECENT FINDINGS: Main findings are that palliative sedation is mostly described in retrospective studies and that the terminology palliative sedation in now common in the majority of the studies. In addition, life-shortening effects for palliative sedation are scarcely reported, although not absent. A number of guidelines have been developed and published, although systematic implementation needs more attention. Consequently, palliative sedation has become more clearly positioned as a medical treatment, to be distinguished from active life shortening. SUMMARY: Caregivers should apply palliative sedation proportionally, guided by the symptoms of the patient without striving for deep coma and without motives for life shortening. Clinical and multidisciplinary assessment of refractory symptoms is recommended as is patient monitoring during sedation. Future research should concentrate on proportional sedation rather than continuous deep sedation exclusively, preferably in a prospective design...|$|E

40|$|In December 2005 {{the first}} {{national}} guideline for palliative sedation in the Netherlands was published. This guideline was developed by a committee of the Royal Dutch Medical Association, {{at the request of}} the Dutch government. The guideline defines palliative sedation as 'the intentional <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> of a patient in the last phase of his or her life'. According to the guideline the objective of palliative sedation is to relieve suffering, and lowering consciousness is a means to achieve this. It is very important that palliative sedation is given for the right indication, proportionally, and adequately. It is the degree of symptom control, not the level to which consciousness is lowered, which determines the dose and combinations of the sedatives used and duration of treatment. The assessment and decision-making processes must focus on adequate relief of the patient's suffering, so that a peaceful and acceptable situation is created. Palliative sedation is given in the last phase of life, in the imminently dying patient. Palliative sedation raises several legal questions. In this article we describe the structure and contents of the guideline, with special attention for the main legal issues involved, like the distinction between palliative sedation and euthanasia and the process of informed consen...|$|E
40|$|Background: Palliative {{sedation}} is {{the intentional}} <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{of a patient}} in the last phase of life to relieve suffering from refractory symptoms such as pain, delirium and dyspnoea. Aim: In this systematic review, we evaluated the use of monitoring scales to assess the degree of control of refractory symptoms and/ or {{the depth of the}} sedation. Design: A database search of PubMed and Embase was performed up to January 2010 using the search terms 'palliative sedation' OR 'terminal sedation'. Data sources: Retro- and prospective studies as well as reviews and guidelines containing information about monitoring of palliative sedation, written in the English, German or Dutch language were included. Results: The search yielded 264 articles of which 30 were considered relevant. Most studies focused on monitoring refractory symptoms (pain, fatigue or delirium) or the level of awareness to control the level of sedation. Four prospective and one retrospective study used scales validated in other settings: the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale, the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, the Communication Capacity Scale and Agitation Distress Scale. Only the Community Capacity Scale was partially validated for use in a palliative sedation setting. One guideline described the use of a scale validated in another setting. Conclusions: A minority of studies reported the use of observational scales to monitor the effect of palliative sedation. Future studies should be focused on establishing proper instruments, most adequate frequency and timing of assessment, and interdisciplinary evaluation of sedation depth and symptom control for palliative sedation. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|E
40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} a group of children with the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome', focussing on age of presentation, the clinical symptoms, possible abnormalities of cerebral imaging and the progression in time of this phenomenon, using inclusion new-established criteria. Also to analyze possible risk factors for the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome' – mainly focussing on headache and migraine – as an expression of a genetic predisposition for hemiplegic migraine. Study design. A prevalence study. Methods. We collected children with traumatic brain injury by means of diagnosis codes and screened them for presence of the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome' using our inclusion criteria. We arranged a revision of the children who met the criteria. We collected the necessary information using a questionnaire and conducted a neurological examination. Also, we reassessed the radiological imaging data. Results. Out of a total of 570 children with a brain concussion in the period 01 / 01 / 2008 to 09 / 12 / 2011 we collected nineteen children with the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome', which we divided into three separate groups. The age at the time of head injury averaged at 7. 1 years, the lucid interval averaged at 61. 9 minutes, the decrease in consciousness averaged at 56. 3 minutes and the total duration averaged at 7. 3 hour. The variations were large in all the variables however. Most of the events of the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome' occurred after a fall from a bike or after a fall on the ground after tripping. The clinical symptoms were found to differ greatly in children aged two to four years – with a <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or somnolence, sometimes accompanied by headache or vomiting – compared with older children – with changes in consciousness often accompanied by focal clinical symptoms, and sometimes no changes in consciousness at all – and often there was a gradual progression in the clinical course. None of the children met the criteria for migraine and none met the criteria for the periodic syndromes in childhood. In the first-degree relatives 17 % of the males and 44 % of the women were having migraine. Together, 11 % of the first-degree relatives were having migraine with aura symptoms. Conclusions. The 'juvenile head trauma syndrome' is a relatively rare phenomenon that not only presents in early childhood. The clinical symptoms are very variable. To really test the possible relationship between hemiplegic migraine and the 'juvenile head trauma syndrome' a larger sample is needed together with genetic research. ...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE There are {{no reports}} on reintubation {{incidence}} and its causes and consequences during the postoperative period following elective intracranial surgery. The objective {{here was to}} evaluate the incidence of reintubation and its causes and complications in this situation. DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective cohort study, using data obtained at a tertiary university hospital between 2003 and 2006. METHODS 169 patients who underwent elective intracranial surgery were studied. Preoperative assessment was performed and the patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death. The rate of reintubation with its causes and complications was ascertained. RESULTS The incidence of reintubation was 12. 4 %, and the principal cause was <b>lowered</b> level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> (71. 5 %). There was greater incidence of reintubation among females (P = 0. 028), and greater occurrence of altered level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{at the time of}} extubation (P < 0. 0001). Reintubated patients presented longer duration of mechanical ventilation (P < 0. 0001), longer stays {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) and in the hospital (P < 0. 0001), greater incidence of pulmonary complications (P < 0. 0001), greater need for reoperation and tracheostomy, and higher mortality (P < 0. 0001).

5000|$|A subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is bleeding into the subarachnoid space—the {{area between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Besides from head injury, it may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Symptoms of SAH include a severe headache with a rapid onset ("thunderclap headache"), vomiting, confusion or a <b>lowered</b> level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and sometimes seizures. The diagnosis is generally confirmed with a CT scan of the head, or occasionally by lumbar puncture. Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Since the 1990s, many aneurysms are treated by a minimal invasive procedure called [...] "coiling", which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels.

5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the <b>lower</b> the risk <b>of</b> pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with <b>lowered</b> level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|R

Metabolic {{disorders such as}} diabetes mellitus and uremia can alter consciousness. Hypo- or hypernatremia (decreased and elevated levels of sodium, respectively) as well as dehydration can also produce an altered LOC. A pH outside of the range the brain can tolerate will also alter LOC. Exposure to drugs (e.g. alcohol) or toxins may also lower LOC, as may a core temperature that is too high or too low (hyperthermia or hypothermia). Increases in intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC. It can result from traumatic brain injury such as concussion. [...] Stroke and intracranial hemorrhage are other causes. Infections of {{the central nervous system}} may also be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the most common symptom of encephalitis. Neoplasms within the intracranial cavity can also affect consciousness, as can epilepsy and post-seizure states. A decreased LOC can also result from a combination of factors.A concussion, which is a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC.|$|R

METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study. the study was carried out on 317 subjects submitted to non-emergency intracranial surgery for tumors, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformation. Preoperative assessment was performed and subjects were followed up for the determination of extubation failure until either discharge from hospital or death. RESULTS: Twenty-six (8. 2 %) of the 317 subjects experienced extubation failure following surgery. the following variables were considered for the multivariate analysis: level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> at the time of extubation, duration of mechanical ventilation prior to extubation, sex and the use of intraoperative mannitol. the multivariate analysis determined that the most important variable for extubation failure was the level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> at the time of extubation (P =. 001), followed by female sex, which also showed to be significant (P =. 006).

40|$|Background/ Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} CT scan findings in acute craniocerebral trauma and the relation between these findings and the level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, 800 pati ents with acute (less than 24 hours) craniocerebral trauma were studied over a period of three years. The patients’ level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> (GCS) were determined and a brain CT scan without contrast agent was performed. A third generation General Electrics (GE) CT scanner was utilized and 10 -mm and 5 -mm sections were obtained for the supratento rial and infratentorial parts, respectively. Results: From 800 patients studied, 641 (80. 1 %) were males and 159 (19. 9 %) were females. The peak age was 25 and the mean age was 26. 80 ± 18. 30. The most common mechanism of head trauma was motor vehicle accidents (60. 1 %). 80. M ild head injury was seen in 75 % of patients,while 14 % and 5. 25 % had moderate and severe head injuries, respectively. In 14. 1 %, the CT scan was normal. The most common lesions were as follows: epidural hematoma (EDH) 27. 1 %, subdural hematoma (SDH) 13. 3 %, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 11. 4 %, contusion 32. 9 % and pneumocephalus 12. 1 %. Intracranial hemorrhage, IVH and subdural hygroma were seen in less than 10 percent of patients. The presence of mixed lesions and midline shift regardless of the background lesions were related to statistically significant decreases in GCS. Conclusion: As one of the leading causes of mortality in Iran, craniocerebral trauma needs more considration, This is true especially for road accidents, which are the main cause of multiple traumas. In <b>lower</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> one should consider more complicated lesions and probable surgical inter vention. The presence of mixed lesions and midline shift regardless of the underlying le sion on CT scan were accompan ied by lower GCS, which may be due to major energy transmission and diff use brain tissue damage and compression of the brain stem...|$|R
