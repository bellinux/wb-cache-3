40|$|The typing {{rules for}} the linear λ-calculus are syntax-directed in that the {{principal}} term constructor determines the typing rule which must be used. Nonetheless, the typing rules are not immediately suitable for an efficient type-checking algorithm since {{we would have to}} guess how the <b>linear</b> <b>hypotheses</b> are to be split between the hypothesis in a number of rules. The occurrence constraints introduced in Section?? would be sufficient to avoid this choice, but they are rather complex, jeopardizing our goal of designing a simple procedure which is easy to trust. Fortunately, we have significantly more information here, since the proof term is given to us. This determines the amount of work we have to do in each branch of a derivation, and we can resolve the don’t-care non-determinism directly. Instead of guessing a split of the <b>linear</b> <b>hypotheses</b> between two premisses of a rule, we pass all linear variables to the first premiss.

These problems result from the <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> used in the establishment and maintenance of ITRF, which includes the <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of the coordinates definition of the ITRF reference stations, and the seven coordinate transformation parameters (three translation parameters, three rotation parameters, and one scale parameter) when the ITRF combine solution is constructed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown how a {{generalized}} form of canonical analysis {{can be useful}} to reveal which parametric functions of a MANOVA model, for instance treatment contrasts or combinations of observed variables, are responsible for rejection of a general <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> on these functions. For the decomposition in successive canonical terms {{the choice of a}} matrix norm is crucial.

Thus, some useful interpretations based on canonical variates can be given in terms of the contributions of the various parametric functions to the overall test statistic or to statistics relevant to specific subhypotheses. Corresponding to these possibilities for interpretation, three different types of biplot are proposed. As an example, an agricultural block design experiment is thoroughly analyzed.

40|$|For the <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in a strucural {{equation}} model, {{the properties}} of test statistics based on the two stage least squares estimator (2 SLSE) have been examined since these test statistics are easily derived in the instrumental variable estimation framework. Savin (1976) has shown that inequalities exist among the test statistics for the <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> but {{it is well known}} that there is no systematic inequality among these statistics based on 2 SLSE for the <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in a structural equation model. Morimune and Oya (1994) derived the constrained limited information maximum likelihood estimator (LIMLE) subject to general linear constraints on the coefficients of the structural equation, as well as Wald, LM and Lr Test statistics for the adequacy of the linear constraints. In this paper, we derive the inequalities among these three test statistics based on LIMLE and the local power functions based on Limle and 2 SLSE to show that there is no test statistic which is uniformly most powerful, and the LR test statistic based on LIMLE is locally unbised and the other test statistics are not. Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine the actual sizes of these test statistics and some numerical examples of the power differences among these test statistics are given. It is found that the actual sizes of these test statistics are greater than the nominal sizes, the differences between the actual and nominal sizes of Wald test statistics are generally the greatest, those of LM test statistics are the smallest, and the power functions depend on the correlations between the endogenous explanatory variables and the error term of the structural equation, the asymptotic variance of estimator of coefficients of the structural equation and the number of restrictions imposed on the coefficients. ...|$|E

The proposed test does not impose any restriction {{on the size}} of the model, i. e. model sparsity or the loading vector representing the hypothesis.

We propose to test the moment conditions related to the newly designed restructured regression, where the inputs are transformed and augmented features. These new features incorporate the structure of the null hypothesis directly. The test statistics are constructed in such a way that lack of sparsity in the original model parameter does not present a problem for the theoretical justification of our procedures.

On the basis of Dyadic wavelet fairing algorithm (DWFA), arbitrary resolution wavelet fairing algorithm (ARWFA), and corresponding software, accuracy control of multiresolution fairing was studied for the uncertainty of fairing scale. Firstly, using the idea of inverse problem for reference, <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> was adopted to predict the corresponding wavelet scale for any given fairing error. Although <b>linear</b> <b>hypothesis</b> has error, it can be eliminated by multiple iterations. So faired curves can be determined by a minimum number of control vertexes and have the best faring effect under the requirement of accuracy. Secondly, in consideration of efficiency loss caused by iterative algorithm, inverse calculation of fairing scale was presented based on the least squares fitting. With the increase of order of curves, inverse calculation accuracy becomes higher and higher. Verification results show that inverse calculation scale can meet the accuracy requirement when fitting curve is sextic.
