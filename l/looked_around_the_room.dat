It's not the old left." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Scalper pauses, {{takes another}} <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and finally lets his eye rest {{for some time}} upon a tall black bottle that stands on the shelf of an open cupboard. Then he goes on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find this}} uncivilised," [...] she replied, with fierce intensity, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Then, on <b>the</b> impulse, she added: [...] "I can't stand it! I {{came here to}} live with my mother, but this is too--too horrible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{where is}} Mr. Van Teyl?" [...] she asked, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "I have been ringing {{up for the}} last ten minutes and couldn't get any answer. I did not realise that it was the next suite." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly. It was the French maid who stood there. She <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and beckoned to the dog.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned the}} lamp {{a little higher}} and <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> <b>room</b> was quite a small one and plainly {{furnished}} as a waiting-room.|$|E

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|R

6000|$|... "A thief!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Just an {{ordinary}} self-convicted thief! That's what I call her, and nothing else.

5000|$|Apparently {{marriage}} did {{not change}} Antoine's womanizing ways. Rebecca West (with whom he had a short affair in 1927) called him [...] "a boudoir athlete".

60|$|And Kwaque it was {{who pulled}} Michael through the {{port-hole}} into Dag Daughtry's stateroom {{and waited for}} that worthy to arrive by the roundabout way of the door. After a quick <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and a sniff of the bunk and under the bunk which informed him that Jerry was not present, Michael {{turned his attention to}} Kwaque.|$|R
30|$|Because in <b>the</b> real <b>room</b> {{baseline}} experiment <b>the</b> observer {{was free}} to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{with his or her}} head from the fixed, seated viewing position, we adopted a similar viewing mode in some presentations. Starting with a cube-map (six cube-face renderings from a single viewpoint covering the full spherical view) panoramic rendering of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> an interactive viewing mode was implemented which allowed <b>the</b> observer to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> keeping a natural FOV and mimicking the head movement which was possible in <b>the</b> real <b>room</b> (Pano). This {{can be thought of as}} an intermediate between a static view of a scene and a walk-through, where the latter would require a real-time graphics engine to render new viewpoints as needed. Our Pano presentation takes advantage of the quality of offline rendering but still gives the observer some freedom to <b>look</b> <b>around.</b> Details of <b>the</b> experiment with FOV and interactive panorama viewing are described in [12].|$|R
