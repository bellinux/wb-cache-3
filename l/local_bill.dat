50|$|A charter {{committee}} {{was formed to}} draw up a charter. The committee met almost weekly during July and August 1999, and formulated a new charter, using the Weston charter as a template. A contest was held to name the town, with 122 different names submitted. A vote was held on October 12, 1999 to select one of the top five names, which Southwest Ranches won. Southwest Ranches Homeowners Association members voted to move forward and request a <b>local</b> <b>bill</b> to allow incorporation in 2000 instead of 2001, which was approved. On March 14, 2000, residents voted overwhelmingly to form a new town rather than be annexed.|$|E

50|$|Palm Harbor is an unincorporated part of Pinellas County.

Pinellas County legislators had voted on January 22, 2009, to support a bill allowing voters in Palm Harbor to decide if they wanted their unincorporated community to become the county's 25th city. It passed over the objections of Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala, who said she was appearing in both her official capacity and as a Palm Harbor resident. The Legislature would have needed to first conduct a feasibility study to make sure cityhood made fiscal sense.|$|E

50|$|In 1851, Ironside {{seconded}} {{a council}} motion {{to call a}} public meeting to decide whether a <b>local</b> <b>bill</b> should be applied for that year. The meeting was little-attended, but supported the proposal. The bill claimed for Sheffield {{a wide range of}} powers, which would include the absorption of the Church Burgesses and the Town Trustees. These two measures were later dropped in order to minimise Parliamentary opposition. A public meeting was held in December and was dominated by Chartists. They opposed it {{on the grounds that it}} did not introduce a universal male franchise for the council, and that it would for the first time impose rates on housing with a rateable value of £7 or less per year. The meeting rejected the bill. Ironside also moved to oppose it, but his change in position alienated both colleagues in favour of it and members who had opposed it from the start.|$|E

This meeting and subsequent meetings with the Honolulu women's club prompted Pitman to write to her connections back to home which helped push a bill through Congress authorizing the Hawaii Territorial Legislature with the power to legislate on the issue of women's suffrage.

After days of debate, the rodeo committee determined the award would be presented to the All Around Champion Jim Rodriguez Jr. instead of the High Money Winners, Jim Olds and Bill Armour.

50|$|During World War I, Taylor and {{her friend}} Emilie Widemann Macfarlane {{organized}} knitting units on behalf of Native Hawaiian soldiers fighting in World War I.Around this same period, she became {{a supporter of the}} women's suffrage movement in 1912.

In 1917, she attended a party hosted by Emma Nakuina to honor Almira Hollander Pitman, a visiting suffragist from the mainland United States, and wife of Benjamin F. Pitman, a cousin of Taylor's. The presence of Taylor and other upper class Honolulu suffragists including Wilhelmina Widemann Dowsett, president of the National Women's Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaii, and subsequent meetings with the club prompted Pitman to write to her political connections back home which helped push a bill through Congress authorizing the Territory of Hawaii with the power to legislate on the issue of women's suffrage.

5000|$|The 1920s brought {{prosperity}} to many regions until {{the beginning of}} the Great Depression, which bankrupted many regions. For the City of Asheville and Buncombe County, North Carolina, the Great Depression caused major economic damage that boiled over into other areas: At the end of the 1920s, around 100,000 people lived in Buncombe County which represented an almost five fold increase over twenty years. Many areas were developed during this time including a large part of downtown Asheville. And {{by the end of this}} period, almost every aspect of community lay in financial ruin including local governments. It took county and city governments over forty years to pay off the indebtedness incurred during the boom period. One of the components of local government that defaulted on their debt was our local water districts. These districts were established to provide public water service to many areas of our community. County government agreed to assume the debts of these water districts. Because the county was liable for the debt, the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Sullivan Act. This <b>local</b> <b>bill</b> forced Asheville to provide water service to these districts at the same rates that they charged city residents.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 {{the library}} had again outgrown its building. Surrounding {{counties}} {{at this time}} were being met with great success by petitioning industrialist Andrew Carnegie for funds to construct their own public libraries. Brooks County similarly requested $10,000 from Carnegie in 1911 and secured {{a grant from the}} Carnegie Library Fund. However, despite this Carnegie grant, the lowest bids for construction were $12,000, and the Library Board denied this increased price believing the Carnegie Fund was more than enough to construct their building. After no plans to secure the bid were found, the Carnegie Fund cancelled the gift in 1919. Still in need of a new library, the citizens now resorted to old methods of fundraising. To help, in 1917 the city of Quitman agreed to provide another $50 per month for library purposes. Additionally, in 1925, Brooks County became the state's first county to pass a <b>local</b> <b>bill</b> authorizing the use of general county funds to support libraries. [...] Funding also began to come in from various local clubs. The Quitman Woman's club provided $2,000, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy and Daughters of the America Revolution promised another $300 yearly. With the advent of the Works Progress Administration the county secured another $5,000 library grant. With adequate funding the new building began construction in 1933 and in 1939 was recognized in a pamphlet by the American Library Association as one of the ideal [...] "Small Library Buildings" [...] in the county - the only one chosen in the entire Southeast.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{originally}} {{formed in}} Hertfordshire in Late 1965 as The Little People, and comprised Angus Shirley (lead guitar), Peter [...] "Dino" [...] Dines (organ, vocals), Bob Argent (bass), and Angus' younger brother Jerry Shirley (drums). They began by playing covers of American R&B records, and emulated {{the music of}} their heroes, The Small Faces. After they supported the latter band on a <b>local</b> <b>bill,</b> Steve Marriott became their mentor, and persuaded Andrew Loog Oldham of Immediate Records to sign them in early 1967. Marriott wanted them to change their name to The Nice, but Oldham insisted on them using the name The Apostolic Intervention, giving the name The Nice to another band instead. Marriott offered the band a song that he and Ronnie Lane had written, [...] "Tell Me (Have You Ever Seen Me)", producing their single and playing bass on the record in preference to Bob Argent. The record {{failed to make the}} charts, and the song was soon recorded by The Small Faces themselves on their album Small Faces (issued in the US in a different form as There are But Four Small Faces). Further attempts at recording The Apostolic Intervention were unsuccessful, and the band split up before the end of 1967. Dines and Jerry Shirley joined Tim Renwick in a band known variously as Little Women and the Wages of Sin. Dines later joined the Keef Hartley Band and T. Rex, while Shirley played sessions before joining Steve Marriott in Humble Pie in 1969.|$|E

The Bill authorised the Manukau City Council to make bylaws that would specify certain places in the district where street-soliciting of prostitution could not occur. The Bill failed at its Second Reading, following {{a report by the}} Local Government and Environment Select Committee recommending that it not be passed. The three main justifications given by the Select Committee to this result are discussed in this paper and are determined as to whether they were accurate and appropriate, or if they were rather mere assumptions. These justifications are that existent laws provided a sufficient solution, the Bill would be an implicit amendment to the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, and that the Bill would face enforcement problems if enacted. This paper finds that while the majority of the justifications given by the Select Committee were accurate, this did not stand true for all their reasoning. Ultimately it is argued that greater scrutiny must be given to Select Committee reports...|$|E
