50|$|Regarded by English Heritage as {{the second}} most {{important}} modern building in London, after the Royal Festival Hall, the building had a low brickwork plinth clad in blue-grey glazing. Above this swooped the most striking feature of the building, the complex hyperbolic paraboloid copper roof, made with 25 tonnes of copper donated by the Northern Rhodesia Chamber of Mines. The concept of creating a 'tent in the park' has often been quoted as the inspiration for the shape of the roof, however, according to Sir Roger Cunliffe (the job architect) while Stirrat Marshall-Johnson (the architect partner-in-charge) always saw the building as being 'in the park' there was no conception of 'tent', and the phrase followed form and did not determine it. Its unusual design proved problematic and it was said to have leaked from the outset. Other design and construction faults emerged relatively soon after completion, which in part stemmed from the restricted budget, and the building proved very costly to run and maintain. The gardens incorporated a <b>large</b> <b>water</b> feature, <b>grass</b> lawns, and a flagpole for each member of the Commonwealth. The interior of the building consisted of a dramatic open space, covered in a tent-like concrete shell, with tiered exhibition spaces linked by walkways. The diagonal, diamond-shaped exhibition block was clearly different from the rectangular administration wing and the junction of the exhibition and administration blocks created a considerable design problem.|$|R
