Load coils are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove load coils on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a <b>loading</b> <b>coil.</b> The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> and grounds rather than one, the equivalent <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{autonomous}} coil alignment system (ACAS) for electric vehicles (EVs) with dynamic wireless charging (DWC) {{to mitigate the}} reduction in received power caused by lateral misalignment between the source and load coils. The key component of the ACAS is a novel sensor coil design, which can detect the load coil’s left or right position relative to the source coil by observing the change in voltage phase. This allows the lateral misalignment to be estimated through the wireless power transfer (WPT) system alone, which is a novel tracking method for vehicular applications. Once misalignment is detected, the vehicle’s lateral position is self-adjusted by {{an autonomous}} steering function. The feasibility of the overall operation of the ACAS was verified through simulation and experiments. In addition, an analysis based on experimental results was conducted, demonstrating that 26 % more energy can be transferred during DWC with the ACAS, just by keeping the vehicle’s <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> aligned with the source coil...|$|E

With correctly chosen conditions, the intense green tongue generated by molecular emission of C 2 and CN emission will be visible between the turns of the induction coil but will not extend above the top of the torch (Boorn and Browner 1982).

Here, we present a mat-based design to wirelessly power moving targets based on this technology. Our design is specifically applied to tran-scutaneously power medical implants within free-moving laboratory animals.

This paper also describes a novel power receiver coil design of the same shape as the exterior of the implant, allowing for maximum magnetic coupling, eliminating the space restrictions due to the coil within the implant, and matching the resonant frequencies of the implant and the transmitter coil. Our new transmitter and receiver designs significantly reduce the size of a biomedical implant and may provide a lifetime power supply to implanted circuits without the need for an internal battery.

40|$|Lead and Tl isotope intensities and ratios were {{measured}} in radial and axial plasma profiles using multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Signal profiles for 204 Pb, 206 Pb, 207 Pb and 208 Pb display mass dependent radial and axial distributions in the plasma. In radial profiles lighter isotopes exhibit greater dispersal from the plasma axis than heavier isotopes, {{in agreement with}} ICP-MS elemental observations. However, signal maxima (I max) for heavier Pb isotopes occur closer to the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> than I max for lighter Pb isotopes, the reverse of ICP-MS elemental observations. These mass dependent distributions predict that the radial dispersion and axial I max locations for 203 Tl and 205 Tl isotopes should occur interspersed with the values for simultaneously measured Pb isotopes. Instead however, their values are appropriate for masses greater that 208 Pb, indicating that the observed profiles are not {{the product of a}} single stage mass dependent process and that other element properties also effect the distributions. Isotope ratio (and thus mass bias) variation with sampling depth reflects both the mass dependent separation of the numerator and denominator isotope I max along the axis of the plasma and the distance along the axis of the plasma over which the isotope signals are distributed. Addition of matrix to the plasma significantly reduces the variability of these two characteristics suggesting that more accurate correction of instrumental mass bias and more accurate normalization of sample ratios to standard values could be achieved by addition of a common matrix to samples and standards. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012...|$|E
40|$|The {{inductively coupled plasma}} is an electrodeless {{discharge}} in a gas (usually Ar) at atmospheric pressure. Radio frequency energy {{generated by}} a RF power source is inductively coupled to the plasma gas through a water cooled <b>load</b> <b>coil.</b> In ICP-MS the {open_quotes}Fassel{close_quotes} TAX quartz torch commonly used in emission is mounted horizontally. The sample aerosol is introduced into the central flow, where the gas kinetic temperature is about 5000 K. The aerosol is vaporized, atomized, excited and ionized in the plasma, and the ions are subsequently extracted through two metal apertures (sampler and skimmer) into the mass spectrometer. In ICP-MS, the matrix effects, or non-spectroscopic interferences, {{can be defined as}} the type of interferences caused by dissolved concomitant salt ions in the solution. Matrix effects can be divided into two categories: (1) signal drift due to the deposition of solids on the sampling apertures; and/or (2) signal suppression or enhancement by the presence of the dissolved salts. The first category is now reasonably understood. The dissolved salts, especially refractory oxides, tend to deposit on the cool tip of the sampling cone. The clogging of the orifices reduces the ion flow into the ICP-MS, lowers the pressure in the first stage of ICP-MS, and enhances the level of metal oxide ions. Because the extent of the clogging increases with the time, the signal drifts down. Even at the very early stage of the development of ICP-MS, matrix effects had been observed.
