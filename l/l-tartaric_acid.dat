40|$|The {{inclusion}} of miconazole into cyclodextrin cavity {{has been demonstrated}} by different authors. Preliminary studies have shown which fragment of the molecule {{is involved in the}} inclusion. In the present study, AM 1 approximate molecular orbital calculations have been performed on several cyclodextrins complexes (CD, HP CD and HP CD) with miconazole and acidic compounds (maleic, fumaric and <b>L-tartaric</b> <b>acids)</b> as partners. For all the binary complexes, the {{inclusion of}} the dichlorobenzene–CH 2 –O-group leads to the most stable complex. For the ternary complexes, depending on their conformation and/or their structures, the acids can either stabilize or destabilize the complex.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{accumulation}} {{has been}} found in large areas of estuaries due to emissions from municipal waste incinerators, car exhausts, residues from metalliferous mining and the smelting industry, and the use of sludge or urban composts, pesticides and fertilizers. In these areas, mangroves have been observed to possess a tolerance to high levels of Cd and it is hypothesized that low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) produced at the soil-root interface (rhizosphere) may {{play an important role in}} the availability of Cd to these plants. Changes in both LMWOAs and Cd bioavailability, directly or indirectly related to the Cd stress were studied in the laboratory. A rhizobox technique was used for 6 months under growth in air-conditioned greenhouse with natural illumination and the relative humidity of 85 %, the temperature ranging from 26 to 32 degrees C, in increasing Cd concentration stress conditions (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ppm). Six-month-old Kandelia candel (L.) Druce seedlings which grown in the rhizoboxes were selected to examine their root exudates. The results showed that monocarboxylic acids (formic, acetic, lactic, butyric and propionic acids), and di- and tricarbonxylic acids (maleic, fumaric, citric and <b>L-tartaric</b> <b>acids)</b> were found in root exudates. Citric, lactic and acetic acids being dominant took up 76. 85 - 97. 87 % of the total LMWOAs in root exudations. Fumaric acid was only found where mangroves were growing on 20 ppm Cd. Root exudates reduced pH by 0. 2 - 0. 5 pH units in the rhizosphere compare to the bulk soil. The proportion of exchangeable Cd and Cd bound to carbonate had a positive correlation to total LMWOAs in the rhizosphere soil. Root exudates induced changes in soil Cd species under control conditions, consisting of lower exchangeable Cd compared with increasing stress. Results indicate that the measurement of LMWOAs may be included as early biomarkers in a plant bioassay to assess the phytotoxicity of Cd-contaminated soils on mangrove plants. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The biosynthetic pathway of <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{the form}} most {{commonly}} encountered in nature, and its catabolic ties to vitamin C, remain {{a challenge to}} plant scientists. Vitamin C and <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> are plant-derived metabolites with intrinsic human value. In contrast to most fruits during development, grapes accumulate <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid,</b> which remains within the berry throughout ripening. Berry taste and the organoleptic properties and aging potential of wines are intimately linked to levels of <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> present in the fruit, and those added during vinification. Elucidation of the reactions relating <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> to vitamin C catabolism in the Vitaceae showed that they proceed via the oxidation of l-idonic acid, the proposed rate-limiting step in the pathway. Here we report the use of transcript and metabolite profiling to identify candidate cDNAs from genes expressed at developmental times and in tissues appropriate for <b>l-tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis in grape berries.
