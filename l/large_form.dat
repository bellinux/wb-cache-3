Some have previously been included in a family Heptaxodontidae, {{but there is little}} evidence that the group is truly natural. Giant hutias are known from Jamaica (Clidomys, Xaymaca, and possibly another, very <b>large</b> <b>form),</b> Hispaniola (Quemisia), Puerto Rico (Elasmodontomys, Tainotherium), and Anguilla and Saint Martin in the northern Lesser Antilles (Amblyrhiza).|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its color}} and habit, Hesler and Smith {{originally}} thought the unknown agaric was H.coccinea {{or perhaps a}} <b>large</b> <b>form</b> of H.miniata, but study of its microscopic characteristics revealed that it was distinct from these. They noted that the fibrillose-squamulose texture of the cap (i.e. that {{it appears to be}} made of thin fibers, or covered with small scales) and the large spores suggested a relationship with H.turundus. The type of Hygrocybe appalachianensis is of an immature specimen, and the description of the basidia only accounted for microbasidia (i.e., the smaller of the two forms of basidia in the hymenium). The immature macrobasidia were described as pleurocystidia (i.e., cystidia arising from the side, or face, of the gill), which Hesler and Smith described as [...] "more or less embedded in the hymenium". Microspores (the smaller of the two spore types produced by the fungus) were not accounted for in their original description, although they are present in the type.|$|E

500|$|Ukiyo-e {{displays}} {{an unusual}} approach to graphical perspective, {{one that can}} appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period. [...] Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the Akita ranga painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods {{to create a sense}} of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines. [...] The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore. [...] The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works. [...] Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs. [...] Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method used in Buddhist pictures, where a <b>large</b> <b>form</b> is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's Great Wave, with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.|$|E
2500|$|The Fantasie in C, Op. 17, {{composed}} {{in the summer}} of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of a monument to Beethoven (who had died in 1827). The first movement of the Fantasie contains a musical quote from Beethoven's song cycle, An die ferne Geliebte, Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were to be [...] "Ruins", [...] "Triumphal Arch" [...] and [...] "The Starry Crown". According to Franz Liszt, who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the Fantasie was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (träumerisch) character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: [...] "It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent". Again, according to Hutcheson: [...] "No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice {{to say that it is}} Schumann's greatest work in <b>large</b> <b>form</b> for piano solo".|$|E

There he remained with eyes fixed on the lists or barrier, within which the champions were about to meet. His daughter, having done all she could for his accommodation, stood motionless beside him, divided between anxiety for his health, and for the event of the combat to her beloved brother. Ere yet the fight began, the old men gazed on their chief, now seen for the first time after several years, and sadly compared his altered features and wasted frame with the paragon of strength and manly beauty which they once remembered.

60|$|At {{my first}} {{admission}} into the printing-house I took to working at press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I {{had been used}} to in America, where presswork is mixed with the composing. I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great drinkers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a <b>large</b> <b>form</b> of types in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands; they wondered to see, from this and several instances, that the Water American, as they called me, was stronger than themselves who drank strong beer! We had an alehouse-boy, who attended always in the house to supply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner; a pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he supposed, to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labour. I endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread, and, therefore, if he could eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer. He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that vile liquor: an expense I was free from; and thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.|$|E
6000|$|The rhea {{possesses}} a unique habit, {{which is a}} puzzle to us, although it probably once had some significance--namely, that of running, when hunted, with one wing raised vertically, like a great sail--a veritable [...] "ship of the wilderness." [...] In every way it is adapted to {{the conditions of the}} pampas in a far greater degree than other pampean birds, only excepting the rufous and spotted tinamous. Its commanding stature gives it a wide horizon; and its dim, pale, bluish-grey colour assimilates to that of the haze, and renders it invisible at even a moderate distance. Its <b>large</b> <b>form</b> fades out of sight mysteriously, and the hunter strains his eyes in vain to distinguish it on the blue expanse. Its figure and carriage have a quaint majestic grace, somewhat unavian in character, and peculiar to itself. There are few more strangely fascinating sights in nature than that of the old black-necked cock bird, standing with raised agitated wings among the tall plumed grasses, and calling together his scattered hens with hollow boomings and long mysterious suspira-tions, as if a wind blowing high up in the void sky had found a voice. Rhea-hunting with the bolas, on a horse possessing both speed and endurance, and trained to follow the bird in all his quick doublings, is unquestionably one of the most fascinating forms of sport ever invented, by man. The quarry has even more than that fair chance of escape, without which all sport degenerates into mere butchery, unworthy of rational beings; moreover, in this unique method of hunting the ostrich the capture depends on a preparedness for all the shifts [...] .and sudden changes of course practised by the bird when closely followed, which is like instinct or intuition; and, finally, in a dexterity in casting the bolas at the right moment, with a certain aim, which no amount of practice can give to those who are not to the manner born.|$|E
