40|$|A {{number of}} routing metrics have been {{proposed}} to select a path with better performance in wireless mesh networks. Most of them partially rely on <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rates when evaluating the path’s performance. Thus accurately measuring the <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rate {{is essential to the}} design of effective routing metrics identifying efficient paths. Currently, a broadcast based probe mechanism is commonly used by routing metrics to estimate the <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rates. However, this mechanism often yields inaccurate <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rates. Based on our extensive simulations, we find out that the limitations of this mechanism are due to: 1) the use of basic (lowest) data rate to probe the loss rate while the link might be used with a higher data rate; 2) the assumption that links are symmetric, which is not true in real case; 3) the low number of packet probes used to measure the <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rate. This work proposes appropriate solutions to the above weaknesses. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed modifications can measure the <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> rate accurately. ...|$|E

40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) links provide secure, high {{bandwidth}} data communications. Links to retro-reflectors {{have the advantage}} of a simple retroreflector terminal design. However, the simplicity of the retro-reflector terminal comes at the cost of the complexity of the interrogator terminal. This paper describes a 16 km free-space laser communications link between a high power interrogator terminal and a modulated retro-reflector array at 2 Mbps. This link was the longest high data rate (> 1 Mbps) modulated retro-reflector link ever reported at the time this paper was written. The 16 km free-space optical link to a modulated-retro-reflector was a tremendous technical challenge. The link range was substantially longer than previous similar FSO links. The extreme link range resulted in much higher <b>link</b> <b>losses</b> than incurred on shorter links. The higher <b>link</b> <b>losses</b> were mitigated through interrogator strategies that included a high power Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) transmitter, an extremely small transmitter divergence, and sophisticated pointing and tracking. To maximize the optical power projected across the link, the transmitter divergence was only 100 µrad. The small transmitter divergence required stringent optical alignment, and high speed pointing and tracking. The high speed pointing and tracking system was a custom design employing two fast steering mirrors and a tone tracking quadcell detector. The <b>link</b> <b>losses</b> were also mitigated by the use of an array of 3 modulated retro-reflectors. The array both increased the optical link margin as well as reduced the atmospheric channel fading. The interrogator terminal was developed by the author at the Laboratory for the Physical Sciences. The author was also responsible for the link calculations and logistics. The modulated retro-reflector array was developed by researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory under the supervision of William Rabinovich. This paper describes the 16 km FSO link scenario, the interrogator system, the modulated retro-reflector array, as well as link performance results. The link performance results presented include pointing and tracking performance, channel fading due to atmospheric scintillation, and the communication link performance using various data protocols...|$|R

A propagation model is needed to estimate the ear-to-ear <b>link</b> <b>loss</b> for such binaural hearing aids.

40|$|International audienceBody area {{networks}} (BAN) offer amazing perspectives {{to instrument}} and support humans in {{many aspects of}} their life. Among all possible applications, this paper focuses on body monitoring applications having a body equipped {{with a set of}} sensors transmitting in real time their measures to a common sink. In this context, at the application level, the network fits with a star topology, which is quite usual in the broad scope of wireless networks. Unfortunately, the structure of the network at the physical layer is totally different. Indeed, due to the specificity of BAN radio channel features, all radio links are not stationary and all sensors suffer from <b>link</b> <b>losses</b> during independent time frames. In wireless networks, <b>link</b> <b>losses</b> are often coped with multi-hop transmission schemes to ensure a good connectivity. However, since the radio links are not stationary, the multi-hop routes should adapt quickly to BAN changes. We instead propose in this work a different approach based on opportunistic relaying. The concept relies on electing some sensors to support the transmission of other ones having a worst connection. Instead of changing the relay time to time, we rather select a relay node from a statistical perspective. We evaluate this approach from a theoretical point of view and on realistic simulations using the packet error rate outage probability as a performance criterion...|$|R
