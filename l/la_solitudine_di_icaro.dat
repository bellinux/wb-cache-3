3000|$|... c In {{his text}} <b>La</b> <b>solitudine</b> degli edifici Moneo seeks the {{long period of}} history and {{resistant}} matter, in which the work lives, in its solitude, autonomously from the architect who conceived it, while in Inquietudine teorica he goes further into the aspects of design, gathering processes and methods, rational and hazardous attitudes of central figures of the debate of the Eighties and Nineties. The reflection of the Master from Madrid indicates that design does not only address physical space, but more deeply social, political, material and constructive space. Several sites that interact in the same place. To study further the thoughts on Moneo, refer to the following texts: (Leoni 2003; Quetglas 1997; Moneo 1999; Moneo 2005 a,[b]; Moneo 2007).|$|R
50|$|The period most dense in {{exhibitions}} and retrospectives, {{with the publication}} of important monographs, was the 1980s. In {{the first half of the}} decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (La caduta <b>di</b> <b>Icaro,</b> 1982; Melanconia ermetica, 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (Trionfo della rappresentazione, 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and mythological references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition - its premises and its promises - became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.|$|R

[417] {355} [It is a {{fact that}} Tasso was an {{involuntary}} inmate of the Hospital of Sant' Anna at Ferrara for seven years and four months--from March, 1579, to July, 1586--but the causes, the character, and the place of his imprisonment have been subjects of legend and misrepresentation. It has long been known and acknowledged (see Hobhouse's Historical Illustrations, 1818, pp. 5-31) that a real or feigned passion for Duke Alphonso's sister, Leonora d'Este, was not the cause or occasion of his detention, and that the famous cell or dungeon ("nine paces by six, and about seven high") was not [...] "the original place of the poet's confinement." [...] It was, as Shelley says (see his letter to Peacock, November 7, 1818), [...] "a very decent dungeon;" [...] but it was not Tasso's. The setting of the story was admitted to be legendary, but the story itself, that a poet was shut up in a madhouse because a vindictive magnate resented his love of independence and impatience of courtly servitude, was questioned, only to be reasserted as historical. The publication of Tasso's letters by Guasti, in 1853, a review of Tasso's character and career in Symonds's Renaissance in Italy, and, more recently, Signor Angelo Solerti's monumental work, Vita di Torquato Tasso (1895), which draws largely upon the letters of contemporaries, the accounts of the ducal court, and other documentary evidence, have in a great measure exonerated the duke {{at the expense of the}} unhappy poet himself. Briefly, Tasso's intrigues with rival powers--the Medici at Florence, the papal court, and the Holy Office at Bologna--aroused the alarm and suspicion of the duke, whilst his general demeanour and his outbursts of violence and temper compelled, rather than afforded, a pretext for his confinement. Before his final and fatal return to Ferrara, he had been duly warned that he must submit to be treated as a person of disordered intellect, and that if he continued to throw out hints of designs upon his life and of persecution in high places, he would be banished from the ducal court and dominions. But return he would, and at an inauspicious moment, when the duke was preoccupied with the ceremonies and festivities of a third marriage. No one attended to him or took heed of his arrival; and, to quote his own words, [...] "in a fit of madness" [...] he broke out into execrations of the ducal court and family, and of the people of Ferrara. For the offence he was shut up in the Hospital of Sant' Anna, and for many months treated as an ordinary lunatic. Of the particulars of his treatment during these first eight months of his confinement, apart from Tasso's own letters, there is no evidence. The accounts of the hospital are lost, and the Libri di spesa (R. Arch. di Stato in Modena; Camer. Ducale: Casa; Amministrazione, Solerti, iii. Docu. 47) do not commence till November 20, 1579. Two years later, the Libri di spenderia (Solerti, in. Docu. 51), from January, 1582, onward, show that he was put on a more generous diet; and it is known that a certain measure of liberty and other indulgences were gradually accorded. There can, however, be little doubt that for many months his food was neglected and medical attendance withheld. His statement, that he was denied the rites of the Church, cannot be gainsaid. He was regarded as a lunatic, and, as such, he would not be permitted either to make his confession or to communicate. Worse than all, there was the terrible solitude. [...] "E sovra tutto," [...] he writes (May, 1580), [...] "m'affligge <b>la</b> <b>solitudine,</b> mia crudele e natural nimica." [...] No wonder the attacks of delirium, the [...] "unwonted lights," [...] the conference with a familiar spirit, followed in due course. Byron and Shelley were ignorant of the facts; and we know that their scorn and indignation were exaggerated and misplaced. But the [...] "pity of it" [...] remains, that the grace and glory of his age was sacrificed to ignorance and fear, if not to animosity and revenge. (See Tasso, by E. J. Hasell; History of the Italian Renaissance, by J. A. Symonds; Quart. Rev., October, 1895, No. 364, art. x.; Vita di Torquato Tasso, 1895, i. 312-314, 410-412, etc.)] ...|$|R
