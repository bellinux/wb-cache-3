500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, and it seemed <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed we would not get anywhere, {{and so it was}} a great surprise when we got the nomination." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It {{was a hard}} decision, {{and this}} was not {{remotely}} {{having to do with}} us wanting to upgrade the acting ability or jump the character in age. The twins who play the part (Jaden and Ella Hiller) were not happy. We started feeling <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just being mean to these little girls, making them come to the stage. And the character is reaching an age where she would talk, and {{that was going to be}} an asset to us to have Cam and Mitch communicating with her." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{voting to}} eject the two teams, {{officials}} banned the Soviet {{team from the}} tournament banquet and medal ceremony, but they still invited Canada. McDonald stated the Canadians were not interested, which Sabetzki and Czechoslovak officials responded to by ordering the Canadian team out of the arena within half an hour. [...] They were met by armed soldiers who escorted them across the border and out of Czechoslovakia. [...] The IIHF voided the standing of both teams, including individual statistics. In the words of McDonald, [...] "it was <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> never here." [...] However, the other teams kept the points they gained in the matches against both teams.|$|E
5000|$|After a runner-up finish, Stewart {{said his}} crew chief [...] "is {{doing a great}} job on the box. You can see the {{confidence}} not only in him, but all the guys on the team. Our Chevys are fast right now. I feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gaining on it. What we said, I don't know when we said it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking about you crawl before you walk, walk before you run, run before you jog and job before you sprint. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> definitely running right now. I feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> getting pretty close to this sprint at the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And they mustn't {{ever forget}} what they've ever been once told," [...] crowed Veronica. [...] "We mustn't {{have to tell}} 'em {{the same thing over}} and over again, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> talking to brick walls." ...|$|R
5000|$|Now I am {{very happy}} that in the great Confessions of the Christian world, our Confession—the Westminster Confession—has its Chapter 1 on the Word of God. … Now the Lord says, [...] "I am going to keep my Word—it is like silver that has been tried. I am going to keep that to all generations, all generations." [...] That means {{that no matter what}} the {{conditions}} are, God is going to have on this earth some churches and some pastors until the last generation were taken away who will maintain this Word <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing here and <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeking to do throughout the whole Christian world.|$|R
500|$|Gemini, {{with the}} {{exception}} of two songs which were filmed in Switzerland, was shot at AVM Studios. One of the songs, [...] "Penn Oruthi", was shot at Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe. Part of the song sequence was filmed on a sledge in Switzerland, making it the second Indian film to have done so after the Bollywood film Sangam (1964). Though there were problems in acquiring permission, executive producer M. S. Guhan persisted. The overseas shoots were arranged by Travel Masters, a Chennai-based company owned by former actor N. Ramji. Gemini was completed on schedule and M. Saravanan praised the director, saying, [...] "...we felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working with S. P. Muthuraman himself, such was Saran's efficiency".|$|E
500|$|Matheos asked Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{to write}} lyrics and perform vocals on one track, which would become [...] "Stockholm". Matheos and Moore sent him the track {{they wanted him}} to work on, and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals. [...] "We were really happy with it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> expecting to... It was a different approach than I would have taken, and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why we wanted to get somebody else to do some vocals on the album." [...] Tim Bowness of No-Man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on [...] "No Celebrations", a bonus track.|$|E
500|$|Poppy Reid of The Music Network {{criticized the}} song for its {{reliance}} on auto-tune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". UR Chicago's Neil Miller, Jr. also gave a negative review of the song, questioning if [...] "Run the World" [...] was meant for Lopez, stating that: [...] "Because up until this point, it seemed <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> listening to the album that Brave {{was meant to be}} – a collection of tracks meant to make us dance, not ones that we're supposed to blast out of our trunks. Swagata Panjari of Radio and Music gave a negative review of the song, stating that it is [...] "slow paced and has a miss on beats which leaves listeners wanting for more".|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall soon get {{accustomed}} to the noise, Bill, and I don't think we shall find the work any harder. They don't put boys at hard work, but just jobs <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing, to help the men." ...|$|R

And a {{excellent}} cold duck, to be sure; and the rum lovely.|$|R
500|$|Clifford was {{irritated by}} being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel [...] "weren't {{trying to fit}} into any one of their scenes and it felt a little <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> almost having {{convention}} thrust upon us when that was the very thing we were reacting against." [...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} among four other episodes {{submitted}} by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. [...] "And I'm Joyce Kinney" [...] was submitted, along with [...] "Halloween on Spooner Street", [...] "Road to the North Pole", [...] "New Kidney in Town" [...] and [...] "Trading Places". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, and it seemed <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed we would not get anywhere, {{and so it was}} a great surprise when we got the nomination." ...|$|E
5000|$|Describing the {{determination}} to continue on Sapozhnikova told Thump “when the house burnt down, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> absolutely 100 percent getting a new space as soon as possible.

500|$|The {{episode was}} notable for its sheer {{amount of water}} and its lack of bright lighting. Director Rob Bowman noted {{that he did not}} film [...] "{{anything}} for that episode during daylight, or with anything brighter than a flashlight or an emergency lamp in the hallway". [...] Bowman explained that [...] "Agua Mala" [...] was extremely difficult to film because every time a crew or cast member got wet, they [...] "had to stop everything to dry them off". Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, in particular, were [...] "water-logged" [...] for a majority of the episode's filming. Anderson later joked, [...] "I mean, we got drenched. It was <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> back in Vancouver!" [...] The show had previously filmed in Vancouver from season one to five before moving to Los Angeles, California, {{at the beginning of the}} sixth season.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{commenced}} {{in early}} November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended {{the script for}} the next episode and freed {{the cast and crew}} from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the [...] mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew [...] "busted [...] butts doing this one. It felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode". Lilly called it [...] "one of the best episodes of the first eight." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{uses the}} Extremis virus from Iron Man 3 as {{one source of}} power for the {{character}} of Mike Peterson. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell explained {{that the idea of}} using it came up independent of the film, but the crew realized {{that it would be a}} good opportunity to tie in with the films, and worked with Marvel Studios on the tie-in to ensure that [...] "they didn't feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just ripping off their idea." [...] Additional sources of power for the character include: Chitauri technology, from The Avengers and Item 47; and super-soldier serum, from [...] and The Incredible Hulk. The events of The Avengers are referenced numerous times throughout the episode, and archive footage from the film is briefly used in an opening montage. Also, Coulson's flying car is a working model of the prototype seen in Captain America: The First Avenger.|$|E
5000|$|... "We find it {{challenging}} to devote {{the time needed}} to find the right monetization partners and strategies," [...] Treisman said. [...] "There are a lot of moving parts and it feels <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> leaving money on the table {{due to the lack of}} time and know-how." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda {{held the}} {{previous}} generations of rabbis {{in the highest}} regard. He would quote the Talmudic proverb: [...] "If the earlier generations <b>are</b> <b>like</b> angels, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> people. And if the earlier generations <b>are</b> <b>like</b> people, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> donkeys." [...] He explained that if we view the scholars of earlier generations <b>like</b> angels, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> people; but if we view them as normal people, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> donkeys.|$|R

500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just felt like it was <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E

"I feel <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{heading to}} a very dark, dark place right now, a place full of fears and {{everyone}} has to be extra careful about what they say," [...] she said, adding that the character resembling Thaksin could represent any leader accused of corruption and abuse of power.|$|R
500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. And it felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed between October and November 2007 {{in the sixth}} {{production}} block of the series, alongside [...] "Exit Wounds". The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations {{were used for the}} wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that [...] "it felt <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had {{to make sure that the}} colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded [...] "as if I was the biggest sinner in the world" [...] and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he called me and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
5000|$|The bins also urged {{donors to}} {{contribute}} {{by claiming that}} Gaia would get [...] "$2 worth for every $1 spent". Gaia Movement USA's director Eva Nielsen explained this by saying [...] "It's more like a symbol. It's not concrete. It's <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> devoting {{a lot of money}} to the environment." ...|$|R
