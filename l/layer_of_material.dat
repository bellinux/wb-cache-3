25|$|As {{observed}} by Lord Rayleigh, {{a thin film}} (such as tarnish) {{on the surface of}} glass can reduce the reflectivity. This effect can be explained by envisioning a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> with refractive index n1 between the air (index n0) and the glass (index nS). The light ray now reflects twice: once from the surface between air and the thin layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.|$|E

25|$|Paper {{companies}} {{produced a}} special form of typewriter paper called erasable bond (for example, Eaton's Corrasable Bond). This incorporated a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft {{and easy to}} remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures {{on this kind of}} paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.|$|E

500|$|By this time, it {{was known}} that the main process by which mesotrons lose energy is {{ionisation}} energy loss, which is described by the Bethe formula, and {{is proportional to the}} mass per unit area of the <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> traversed. [...] If this were the only process, the intensity of the hard component passing through a layer of solid material would decrease by the same amount as in an equivalent layer of air. Rossi and his collaborators found that the decrease was significantly larger in the atmosphere than in a corresponding layer of solid carbon. [...] Because the distance traversed in air was much larger than that in carbon, they interpreted this result as evidence for decay of the mesotron, and taking into account the effect of relativistic time dilation, estimated its mean life at rest as roughly 2microseconds.|$|E

2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E
