30|$|The {{following}} conclusions {{were presented}} at a 2013 conference {{sponsored by the}} Society of Petroleum Geophysicists, India (Jamkhindikar et al. 2013): (1) Oil bearing zones are interpreted in 6 wells {{in the area in}} Deccan Trap based on oil shows during drilling/interpretation of log motifs; (2) one well has produced commercial quantity of oil during initial production testing after <b>lowering</b> <b>casing</b> and perforating a 4  m zone in fractured basalt near top of Deccan Trap; (3) one nearby well in Unawa area is producing oil from Deccan Trap for the last 24  years which conclusively proves prospectivity of Deccan Traps {{in this part of the}} basin; (4) Deccan Traps can be identified from well logs and Micro-resistivity borehole images; (5) it is sometimes difficult to distinguish Deccan Traps from overlying Olpad formation from drill cuttings as highly altered basalt results in clays, so cuttings of Deccan Trap are described as trap derivatives/clay. The top of Deccan Traps could be successfully traced on 2 D and 3 D seismic lines, particularly in shallower part of the block; (6) integration of micro-resistivity borehole images and formation pressure test results point toward existence of primary (vesicular) porosity and secondary (fracture) porosity in Deccan Traps. Also, presence of mega-vesicles seen on borehole images of some wells and resistivity logs showing good invasion profile indicates that vesicular zones can be good reservoirs; (7) fracture characterization based on micro-resistivity borehole images has brought out preferred fracture orientation at each well location. The fractures are generally related to faults as stress relieving antithetic fractures. These fractures can provide conduits for hydrocarbon charging through faults; and (8) the study of fault pattern in the area coupled with occurrence of oil bearing zones in the Deccan Trap suggests that the N–S and NE–SW trending faults are the main migratory pathways for oil. Thus, areas of local highs near these faults could be the main targets for exploration of Deccan Trap in northern part of Cambay Basin.|$|R
30|$|A {{decision}} {{must be made}} in {{an attempt}} to optimize the well production when the operator is not sure if increasing the pump speed or <b>lowering</b> the <b>casing</b> pressure (to secure the higher fluid level in the casing) would cause any trouble by sand. In this case, the operator faces two options, depending on the fluid level in the casing: (i) increasing pump speed with adjusting casing pressure and (ii) increasing pump speed without adjusting the casing pressure. First, the current wellbore pressure has to be calculated using the methodology introduced in Section “Methodologies”. Then, the methodology described in Section “Methodologies” should be used to predict the oil production and the increase in oil viscosity, respectively, at a certain increase in the wellbore pressure. Based on the knowledge of the anticipated production rate, the fluid level at any combination of the pump speed and casing pressure can be estimated using Eq.  26. The methodologies introduced in this article would help the operator’s decision making process. However, the operator’s past experience with the well must be added so as to accomplish the best result.|$|R
2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the <b>casing</b> <b>lowers</b> the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber.

When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the valve spring and gas flow stops.|$|R

A series of loading increments is applied, with the connection of the tree/blowout preventer (BOP) as the last. The settlement at the mudline was calculated to be less than 0. 1 m.

40|$|Time-resolved PIV and time-resolved stereo PIV {{measurements}} {{are carried out}} in the tip leakage vortex of a single non-rotating airfoil placed in the potential core of a flanged rectangular jet in free field conditions. The experiment is based on the improvement of an existing rig: a cambered airfoil (NACA 5510) now mounted with a 16. 5 ° ± 0. 5 ° angle of attack between two horizontal plates, a 10 mm gap being maintained between the airfoil tip and the <b>lower</b> (<b>casing)</b> plate. The mean flow velocity is 70 m/s, which corresponds to a 0. 2 Mach number and a chord-based Reynolds number of 933, 000. Unlike in the former experiment carried out with this rig, the boundary layer thickness is now smaller than the gap, which significantly reduces the interaction between the upstream turbulence and the airfoil leading edge as well as the resulting interaction noise. The measurements described here include the far field. The upstream flow is characterised with hotwire anemometry. LDV profiles are also obtained in the tip leakage region and compared to the PIV measurements. The experiment is also designed to provide validation data for unsteady CFD computations of the same configuration as shown in a companion paper...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aerodynamics}} of transonic fans {{is discussed}} {{with emphasis on}} the use of three-dimensional design techniques, such as blade sweep and lean, to improve their performance. In order to study the interaction of these 3 D features with the shock pattern a series of five different designs is produced and analysed by CFD. It is found that the 3 D features have remarkably little effect on the shock pattern near the tip where the shock must remain perpendicular to the <b>casing.</b> <b>Lower</b> down the blade significant shock sweep, and hence reduced shock loss, can be induced by 3 D design but this is usually at the expense of reduced stall margin and increased loss elsewhere along the blade span. Overall, very little change in efficiency is produced by blade sweep or lean. However, forwards lean of the rotor does produce a small increase in mass flow. Radial migration of the boundary fluid on the suction surface behind the shock is shown to play a large part in the aerodynamics near the blade tip...|$|R

Validation of the model is performed against the available experimental results. The effect of feed flow rate and sweep flow rate on oxygen permeation has been evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of feed and sweep flow rates on temperature and reaction characteristics are presented. Increasing the feed flow rates beyond certain limits do not significantly affect the oxygen permeation characteristics, however, increases the convective and advective heat losses from the membrane <b>casing</b> <b>lower</b> performance of the OTR. It is also observed that increasing the sweep flow rates results in higher oxygen fluxes but with leaner flames. The optimal flow rates of 0.001  kg/s for air/feed flow rate and sweep flow rates in the range of 7 e− 5 to 1 e− 4  kg/s under the assumptions given herein for the present geometry model are suggested. The feasibility of using liquid fuels as potential fuel to be used in near future in oxygen transport reactors has been presented.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the process}} of {{drilling}} an oil or gas well, a steel production casing is often inserted to the bottom of the well and sealed with cement against the productive formation. Openings must be made through the steel casing wall and cement and into the rock formation to allow formation fluid to enter the well. Conventionally, a perforator is <b>lowered</b> through the <b>casing</b> on a wire line. When it is in the correct position, bullets are fired or explosive charges are set off to create an open path between the formation and the production string. As effective as those processes are in creating a hole or tunnel, they alter the surrounding rock and cause formation damage around the created tunnel. The permeability of the altered zone is significantly less than virgin formation by as much as 80 %. The petroleum industry welcomes new perforation technologies that not only create holes effectively but also minimize the formation damage. This paper will present the feasibility study results of application of high power lasers to perforation completions and focus on methods for creating deep holes in rocks by high power lasers...|$|R
5000|$|The Westbay MP {{system is}} a modular {{instrumentation}} system for multilevel groundwater monitoring acquired by Nova Metrix in 2015, the MP system consists of two parts: (1) the casing system and (2) portable probes and tools that provide a compatible data acquisition system. The Westbay casing system is designed to allow the monitoring of multiple discrete levels in a single borehole. The casing comes in two different sizes, the MP38 system (38 mm, 1.5-inch) and MP55 system (55 mm, 2.25-inch). [...] One single string of water-tight Westbay casing sections is installed in the borehole. Each desired monitoring zone has valved couplings and ports to access groundwater outside the casing and instruments inside the casing. Westbay packers or backfilled seals are used to seal the borehole between monitoring zones to prevent the unnatural vertical flow of groundwater in the wellbore and maintain the in situ distribution of fluid pressures and chemistry. The Westbay system can be installed in either open rock boreholes or cased wells with multiple screens. Systems have also been installed in backfilled boreholes. Specialized equipment and probes <b>lowered</b> down the <b>casing</b> to each port are used to monitor and collect samples from Westbay systems. This system can incorporate {{a large number of}} monitoring intervals because the system is entirely modular and does not require multiple tubes extending to the ground surface. Westbay MLS systems have been installed to a maximum depth of 7,128 feet. Additional information about the system is presented by Black et al. (1986) and Einarson (2006). More information is also available on the website.|$|R
40|$|Main Body- The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} design of gas lift equipment have faced many challenges over the years. Designs of production wells for lifting oil using low casing pressure lead to cold flow of the extracted fluid. This is because the wells need lower rates of gas lift. It is recommended to use gas lifting pressure in the range of 1120 to 1200 Psi [1]. Producers, who produce lower volumes of oil, require small amounts of gas in order to lift the fluid. They fit gas chokes for controlling the volume of gas lift in gas lift wells. Lower oil production gas volume is small and this leads to a falling in pressure which eventually lowers the temperature of the injected gas that flows down the casing. The reduction in temperature of the casing surfaces results in the cooling of the temperature of the gases in the <b>casing</b> <b>lower</b> than the deeper depths. The low gas temperatures on the surface casing also cool down the temperature of the lifted oil, sometimes to temperatures below the pour point temperature of the surface. This low temperature of the produced crude oil leads to the formation of wax in the production string. The condition is worse in the winter season when the country experiences extreme weather conditions. The condition may exceedingly limit the flow of oil or even plug the oil tubing entirely [2]. As a remedy to this problem, high pressure gas with the potential of raising the temperature in the well need to be introduced. This can be done through the design of wells whereby the oils are lifted at pressures higher than the pour point pressures to prevent wax formation. Chemical treatment may also be adopted. In the chemical treatment procedure, wax inhibitors are injected down the casing together with gas to keep the tubing clean. Another method that {{can be used as a}} remedy is the wire line tools. They are used t...|$|R
40|$|Today {{the world}} is {{experiencing}} an ever increasing energy demand. Since petroleum resources are an important contributor to the energy demands of the modern world, exploration efforts are being pushed to new frontiers. Deep-water offshore exploration involves a number of challenges that has pushed for new technology development. Dual-gradient drilling systems like Subsea Mudlift Drilling (SMD) - and Low Riser Return System (LRRS) are leading contactors in this new area of drilling technology. LRRS has a subsea mud pump that enables having the riser only partially filled with mud, as the pump will transport mud from the riser to rig surface. Above the mud is air or an inert gas mixture. This {{makes it possible to}} drill with a higher mud-weight compared to conventional offshore operations, and also regulate BHP quickly by changing the riser fluid level. It is very important to evaluate the safety of this new system, especially with regards to well control. In determining the pressure buildup during an unscheduled influx of formation fluids (kick), and compare it with a conventional offshore drilling system, it is possible to determine how much influx LRRS can take compared to the conventional setup. Doing so will determine the operational safety and limitations of LRRS compared to conventional drilling operation. The major benefit of LRRS is the ability to have a much <b>lower</b> pre-kick <b>casing</b> pressure than a conventional system. Since the mud weight of LRRS will be higher in deep water operations, the pressure gradient is equally higher. When both systems have the same BHP, LRRS will have a much larger difference between casing shoe pressure and fracture pressure at the casing shoe. As a result LRRS can take much larger influxes (82, 9 % in 650 m water depth) compared to the conventional system when a kick is encountered at the same depth and with the same kick intensity. When a gas bubble is pressure relieved as it migrates up hole, a certain amount of mud must be bled form the well to induce a given pressure reduction within the gas. Since LRRS has a heavier mud-weight, the loss of hydrostatic will be higher. This leads to a steeper pressure buildup curve, which will reduce the benefits of LRRS in slim holes and when large influxes are taken. In the case of 650 m water depth LRRS has a benefit in slim-hole of 30, 6 %. The benefits of LRRS are magnified in deep waters, where the mud-weight difference is large. In a deep water case, LRRS has a kick-margin benefit of 170, 7 % over conventional. However, when the influx volume is increased from 10 m 3 to 15 m 3 LRRS’s kick margin benefit over conventional is 105, 3 %. Compared to the leading dual-gradient drilling system (SMD) LRRS has a 25, 6 % kick margin benefit, in 650 m water depth. This is because LRRS can operate with even higher mud-weight than the SMD system. In deeper waters the relative benefit of LRRS compared to SMD with regard to the conventional system, will be lower. </p...|$|R
40|$|For the {{geothermal}} wells of the Delft Aardwarmte Project it {{has been}} chosen to drill with glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) composite casing in a drilling-with-casing setup. This MSc thesis report describes the results of experimental work to assess the stress-strain behaviour of GRE casing, in particular under axial, torsional and combined axial-torsional loading. These properties have subsequently been {{used to assess the}} effects of using GRE casing on standard drilling properties such as the stretch and twist of the drilling tubulars, and the effect on torsional vibrations. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1. For axial loads (in tension) up to 33 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. No evidence was found of non-linear behavior. b. The measured elasticity modulus is 1. 91 * 1010 N/m², which corresponds closely to the manufacturer’s data. c. The maximum expected elongation of a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 1. 66 m, which is 0. 06 m more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions [...] 2. For torsional loads up to 98 % of the expected maximum drilling loads: a. The stress-strain behaviour in the tangential direction remains linear. b. The shear modulus measured is deemed incorrect due to the mechanical properties of the test bench. The shear modulus as reported by the manufacturer is 6. 78 * 109 N/m 2. c. The maximum expected twist in a GRE casing string of 3300 m used for drilling-with-casing is 9. 25 turns which is 6. 3 turns more than that of a steel drill pipe under similar drilling conditions. d. The natural frequency in torsional vibration of a GRE <b>casing</b> is much <b>lower</b> than that of a steel casing in a comparable drilling setup due to its much lower torsional stiffness. However the large diameter of casing, as compared to conventional drill pipe, results in an increase in torsional stiffness. The combined effect is an increased natural frequency of GRE casing compared to steel drill pipe. e. As a result, the critical rotary speed, i. e the rotary speed below which one can expect the occurrence of stick-slip torsional vibrations, is <b>lower</b> for GRE <b>casing</b> than for steel drilling pipe under similar drilling conditions, i. e. the effect is beneficial. 3. Under increasing axial tension the torsional stress-strain behaviour displays an increasing hysteresis. a. The torsional dampening, expressed as energy loss per loading/unloading cycle ranges from xx% to xx%. This is much higher than the typical internal torsional damping in steel drill pipe. b. The typical external torsional dampening caused by fluid drag and borehole friction while drilling is in the order of 50 %. The effect of internal damping caused by hysteresis during torsional loading of GRE casing is therefore noticeable, and results in a further beneficial decrease in the critical rotary speed for stick-slip torsional vibrations.
