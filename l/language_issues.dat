25|$|Owing to {{a common}} history and shared experiences, as well as {{interactions}} at different levels along the centuries, many of the traditional Catalan symbols overlap with those of Aragon, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. This is often cause of controversies, as {{it is often difficult}} to resolve conflicts regarding differing perceptions of the culture, the history and the <b>language</b> <b>issues</b> surrounding what was the former Crown of Aragon and the culturally Catalan geographic areas. Places like the Poblet Monastery where the ancient kings lie buried are especially revered as common symbols that helped consolidate Catalonia in the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Corpus {{planning}} is often undertaken by planners with great linguistic expertise. Corpus {{planning is}} also referred as making language planning decisions to engineer {{changes in the}} structure of a language. The Singapore Government has been active in status planning and acquisition planning however with regards to corpus planning in English, nothing has been done.The government modelled Singaporean English after Standard British English, without recognising the internal issues of English which must be specific to the local context. Due to the lack of a government body that deals with <b>language</b> <b>issues</b> such as codification and purification, there is negligence to local English, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether there is a Standard Singapore English.|$|E

25|$|The {{preponderance}} of dubbed roles was {{partly due to}} casting. Dušan Hanák wanted Rosy Dreams to feature little-seen and authentic actors. He turned to Czech actors to bring fresh faces to the Slovak silver screen, but out of those he cast, only Libuše Havelková {{and to some degree}} Václav Babka managed to speak the Slovak lines well enough not to require dubbing. Retaining the actors' voice proved almost impossible with the Romani characters. The otherwise adept Iva Bittová, a student at the music conservatory in Brno in Czech-speaking Moravia and daughter of a Moravian-Czech mother and a Romani father from the Galanta District in western Slovakia, had had little practical experience with Slovak and none with Romani, and the other Romani non-actors needed to be dubbed either for <b>language</b> <b>issues,</b> or because of their inexperience.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, {{linguistic}} discussions of Irish focused either on the traditional grammar of the <b>language</b> (<b>issues</b> like the inflection of nouns, verbs and adjectives) or on the historical development of sounds from Proto-Indo-European through Proto-Celtic to Old Irish. The first descriptive analysis of the phonology of an Irish dialect was , which was based on the author's fieldwork in the Aran Islands. This was followed by , a phonetic description of the dialect of Meenawannia near Glenties, County Donegal. [...] is predominantly a historical account, but has some description of modern dialects as well. Alf Sommerfelt published early descriptions of both Ulster and Munster varieties ( [...] and [...] for the village of Torr in Gweedore, [...] for Munster, and [...] for the now extinct dialect of South Armagh). The dialect of Dunquin on the Dingle Peninsula was described by [...] From 1944 to 1968 the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies published a series of monographs, each describing the phonology of one local dialect: [...] for West Muskerry in County Cork (Ballyvourney, Coolea and vicinity), [...] (first published 1945) for Cois Fhairrge in County Galway (Barna, Spiddal, Inverin and vicinity), [...] for An Rinn, County Waterford, [...] for Tourmakeady in County Mayo, [...] for Teelin, County Donegal, [...] for Erris in County Mayo. More recent descriptive phonology has been published by [...] for Rosguill in northern Donegal, [...] for Tangaveane and Commeen (also near Glenties), [...] for Iorras Aithneach in Connemara (Kilkieran and vicinity), and [...] for the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry.|$|E

40|$|The <b>language</b> <b>issue</b> {{within the}} European {{constitutional}} space {{is one of}} the most fascinating challenges to supranational integration. On the one hand, the principle of equal standing of all official and working languages is constantly reaffirmed; on the other hand the necessity to simplify the European Babel on the basis of a more functional consideration of the <b>language</b> <b>issue</b> seems unavoidable. Several solutions have been proposed both by scholars and by European institutions. The paper argues that there is an intimate contradiction in today’s linguistic policy in the EU, oscillating between the need to simplification and the constitutional duty to respect linguistic pluralism as imposed by the member states. In fact, the <b>language</b> <b>issue</b> is just the mirror of the constitutional law of integration as a whole. Looking closer at the constitutional dimension of supranational integration cal help better address the <b>language</b> <b>issue</b> too. The analysis is divided in four parts, dealing respectively with the role and the limits of law in matters of language, the present allocation of competences in language-issues, the development of the concept of “integrated constitutional space”, and its legal nature under the viewpoint of the language dimension, elaborating some tentative proposals...|$|R
