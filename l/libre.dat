40|$|Ankara : The Department of History, Bilkent Univ., 2010. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 113 - 116. This thesis {{explores the}} American immigrant anarcho-feminist Emma Goldman‟s (1869 - 1940) {{affiliation with the}} Spanish anarcho-feminist organization Mujeres <b>Libres</b> [Free Women] during the Spanish Civil War both as a guide and an aide. No study devoted exclusively to Emma Goldman‟s relation with Mujeres <b>Libres</b> has ever been published. The aim of this thesis is two-fold: firstly, it redresses the current historiography arguing that rather than Mujeres <b>Libres,</b> Emma Goldman pioneered the anarcho-feminist ideology. Goldman acted {{as a guide to}} Mujeres <b>Libres</b> in its dual committment to anti-fascist struggle and sexual emancipation. Secondly, this thesis shows that out of her solidarity with Mujeres <b>Libres,</b> Goldman carried the anarcho-feminist movement onto the international platform through her propaganda and fund-raising activities for the refugees of the Spanish Civil War.
