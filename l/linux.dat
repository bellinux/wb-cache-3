5|$|Many {{operating}} systems include Python {{as a standard}} component; the language ships with most <b>Linux</b> distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS, {{and can be used}} from the terminal. Many <b>Linux</b> distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat <b>Linux</b> and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo <b>Linux</b> uses Python in its package management system, Portage.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has {{similarities}} with <b>Linux,</b> {{with two}} major differences {{in scope and}} licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to <b>Linux</b> delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license {{as opposed to the}} copyleft GPL used by <b>Linux.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} <b>Linux</b> can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most <b>Linux</b> binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, <b>Linux</b> executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to <b>Linux,</b> such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E

5|$|The team {{developing}} the <b>Linux</b> client {{had been working}} for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for <b>Linux</b> had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal beta testing of the <b>Linux</b> client started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year. Open beta clients for <b>Linux</b> were made available in late December 2012, and the client was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve's <b>Linux</b> division assured that its first game on the OS, Left 4 Dead 2, wpuld run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other <b>Linux</b> distributions. <b>Linux</b> games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise <b>Linux</b> were released by October 2013. By June 2014, the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam had reached over 500, surpassing over 1,000 by March 2015. A year later, this number doubled to over 2,000.|$|E

5|$|A German <b>Linux</b> {{programmer}} from gpl-violations.org {{obtained a}} preliminary injunction against Fortinet's UK subsidiary in April 2005, due to {{allegations that the}} company was using encryption to hide its use of <b>Linux</b> kernels that are subject to a General Public License (GPL). The license's terms require disclosure of the source code. The following month Fortinet agreed to make its source code for GPL-licensed elements available upon request, modified its licensing terms and made other changes, ending the dispute.|$|E

That same day, {{the first episode}} was made indefinitely available for free on <b>Linux,</b> Windows, OS X, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Life Is Strange was included on PlayStation Plus {{for the month of}} June 2017, along with Killing Floor 2.|$|E

5|$|As of February 2014, SteamOS, Valve's own Linux-based {{operating}} system, supports Portal 2 and its predecessor, as do {{most modern}} Debian-based <b>Linux</b> distributions on its services via the Steam client. Released as a Beta in early 2014 for <b>Linux</b> distributions, it holds {{all of the}} same traits as the other versions, retaining cross-platform play, split screen and fully native controller support.|$|E

5|$|Debian 0.01, {{released}} on September 15, 1993, {{was the first}} of several internal releases. Version 0.90 was the first public release, providing support through mailing lists hosted at Pixar. The release included the Debian <b>Linux</b> Manifesto, outlining Murdock's view for the new operating system. In it he called {{for the creation of a}} distribution to be maintained openly, in the spirit of <b>Linux</b> and GNU.|$|E
5|$|Debian {{supports}} <b>Linux</b> officially, offered kFreeBSD for version 7 but not 8, and GNU Hurd unofficially. GNU/kFreeBSD {{was released}} as a technology preview for IA-32 and x86-64 architectures, and lacked {{the amount of}} software available in Debian's <b>Linux</b> distribution. Official support for kFreeBSD was removed for version 8, which did not provide a kFreeBSD-based distribution.|$|E
50|$|Kuki <b>Linux's</b> key aim was {{to deliver}} full {{hardware}} compatibility with the Acer Aspire One without additional configuration or modification. It used the Xfce desktop environment.|$|R
50|$|By 2002, while <b>Linux's</b> popularity, {{and hence}} the {{installed}} base of X, surged, X.Org was all but inactive; active development was largely carried out by XFree86. However, there was considerable dissent within XFree86.|$|R

50|$|Both {{versions}} of l7-filter use regular expressions (though the user-space and kernel modules use different regular expression libraries) {{to identify the}} network protocol. This technique, {{used in conjunction with}} <b>Linux's</b> QoS system, allows application-specific yet port-independent traffic shaping.|$|R
50|$|Impi <b>Linux's</b> first release, version 1, was {{released}} 1 November 2003. A few other companies provided sponsorships {{in the form}} of professional media and public relations from MIP Holdings as well as bandwidth and an FTP mirror from Internet Solutions.|$|R
5|$|From 1999, {{the project}} leader was elected yearly. The Advanced Packaging Tool was {{deployed}} with Debian 2.1. The amount of applicants was overwhelming {{and the project}} established the new member process. The first Debian derivatives, namely Libranet, Corel <b>Linux</b> and Stormix's Storm <b>Linux,</b> were started in 1999. The 2.2 release in 2000 was dedicated to Joel Klecker, a developer who died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.|$|E

5|$|Loki Games {{worked on}} a <b>Linux</b> version of the game, but the company went out of {{business}} before releasing it. The OpenGL layer they wrote for the port, however, was sent out to Windows gamers through an online patch, which also makes the game far more compatible with Wine on <b>Linux</b> {{than it would have been}} with only Direct3D.|$|E
50|$|L7-Filter is a {{classifier}} for <b>Linux's</b> Netfilter {{that identifies}} packets based on application layer data. It can classify packets such as Kazaa, HTTP, Jabber, Citrix, Bittorrent, FTP, Gnucleus, eDonkey2000, and others. It classifies streaming, mailing, P2P, VOIP, protocols, and gaming applications.|$|R

50|$|When IP {{forwarding}} is enabled, {{the operating}} system kernel will act as a router. In FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and Darwin/Mac OS X, the parameter net.inet.ip.forwarding can be set to 1 to enable this behavior. In <b>Linux's</b> emulation of sysctl, the parameter is called net.ipv4.ip_forward.|$|R
