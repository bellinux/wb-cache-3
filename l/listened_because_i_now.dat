6000|$|MISS SPAULDING: [...] "No matter. There's {{no excuse}} for me. <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a woman, and couldn't help it; and, oh, what will he think of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not very}} convincing--but what could you say? And you are, after all, not very wise," [...] she said. [...] "I wonder if I might tell you that I knew part of this long ago; but the rest I did not know until the evening the team bolted in the hollow. Still," [...] and Lucille grew grave again, [...] "would it hurt you very much if I said <b>I</b> could not <b>listen</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feared you were only dreaming this time, too?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gloriana member Tom Gossin co-wrote {{the song}} with Josh Kear, who also wrote the band's debut single [...] "Wild at Heart". Gossin based the duet around a {{conversation}} between two girls that he overheard at a restaurant. After one of them said, [...] "Girl, that is his job {{to make the first}} move!", Gossin said, [...] "My ears perk up, and <b>I</b> was <b>listening</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to know {{what they had to say}} about it. They were like, ‘It is always the guy’s job. Just push her up against the wall and do it!’ That became like the first idea that I had when I wrote with Josh." ...|$|R

2500|$|Baker is cynical of {{religion}} and describes himself as irreligious, or occasionally as Buddhist, but not anti-religious. He states: [...] "People are quite happy believing the wrong things. I wasn't unhappy believing all that shit. Now I'm not unhappy thinking about it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can laugh at it." [...] Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, saying in 1998: [...] "When the Conservatives were in I cannot {{tell you how much}} I hated them. But I realise how shallow <b>I</b> am <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> hate the Labour Party as much." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 9 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Pašalić for a reported fee of £3 million. Upon signing, Pašalić said, [...] "I am very happy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>now</b> a Chelsea player." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, Staind guitarist Mike Mushok noted {{his lack}} of {{appreciation}} for the album: [...] "We {{have a lot of}} fans who say, 'I love Tormented.' I'm like, 'Have you ever <b>listened</b> to it? <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> can't.' But that's great – that's why they're fans." ...|$|R
60|$|I acceded to {{this the}} more readily, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> reproached myself with having treated her former letter rather lightly. It had set me {{thinking}} a good deal at the time, as I have mentioned in its place; but my absorption in my own affairs, my experience of the family, and my hearing nothing more, had gradually ended in my dismissing the subject. I had often thought of the Micawbers, but chiefly to wonder what 'pecuniary liabilities' they were establishing in Canterbury, and to recall how shy Mr. Micawber was of me when he became clerk to Uriah Heep.|$|R

30|$|Yes, I {{mean there}} are challenges.... One is cultural, for example, like festivals....Pakistani and Indian culture are not very different. But maybe if someone from the UK is working {{directly}} with them, they might have more problems initially. But it is less problems for me, and coming here [to the UK] really helped me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> understand; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> understand the working culture over here better.|$|R
5000|$|Of this criticism, Gandhi stated, [...] "There was a {{time when}} people <b>listened</b> to me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms ... but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the Hindu-Moslem riots and, therefore, people should arm {{themselves}} for self-defense." ...|$|R

5000|$|In February 2007, Neculai Munteanu {{revealed}} that he was gay on his radio show. He stated that, [...] "I must say this because it is true and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can <b>now</b> say it {{to people who are}} tolerant, from a European country, who have learnt that the person close to you can also be different from you, but still human".|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with E!, Kudrow also had this to say: [...] "I {{would love to do}} more. In 2005, that was an ending, that was definitely an ending <b>because</b> <b>I</b> guess <b>now</b> we see that those episodes were a piece and these episodes were a piece and then if we do more then we will be doing that piece." ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the less}} I say of these sick experiences, the less tedious {{and the more}} intelligible I shall be. I do not recall them to make others unhappy or <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>now</b> the least unhappy in remembering them. It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to {{alleviate}} their intensity.|$|R

60|$|The path led {{straight}} across the clearing into another forest, lying upon {{the verge of}} which I saw a bit of white. It appeared to stand out in marked contrast and incongruity to all its surroundings, and when I stopped to examine it, I {{found that it was}} a small strip of muslin--part of the hem of a garment. At once I was all excitement, for I knew that it was a sign left by Lys that she had been carried this way; it was a tiny bit torn from the hem of the undergarment that she wore in lieu of the night-robes she had lost with the sinking of the liner. Crushing the bit of fabric to my lips, I pressed on even more rapidly than before, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> knew that <b>I</b> was upon the right trail and that up to this, point at least, Lys still had lived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh;--Mr. Morton's cousin. I {{asked whether}} you were the owner of that farm-house <b>because</b> <b>I</b> intruded just <b>now</b> by passing through the yards, and I would have apologized. Good {{afternoon}} to you, sir." [...] Then Reginald having thus done his duty returned home.|$|R
60|$|The {{sentence}} {{with which}} I finished {{the last chapter}} appears to me essential, <b>because</b> what <b>I</b> am <b>now</b> about to describe may seem to many readers more like the dreams of fancy than the details of sober fact.|$|R
5000|$|Gandhi {{came under}} {{political}} fire for {{his criticism of}} those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means. Gandhi responded, [...] "There {{was a time when}} people <b>listened</b> to me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms ... but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the riots and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't bear to think," [...] he answered, in {{a broken}} voice, {{looking at his}} own little girl, a sweet, curly-haired, blue-eyed child of six, named Tota, whom I had often nursed as a baby. [...] "Oh, Heer Allan, your father, the Predicant, always warned me against {{trekking}} north, and I never would <b>listen</b> to him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought him a cursed Englishman; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> see my folly. Heer Allan, if you can, try to save my child from those black devils; if you live longer than I do, or if you can't save her, kill her," [...] and he clasped my hand.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his BBC Radio 1 weekend show, he joined BBC Radio London in 1981, where he presented the weekday afternoon show. It was here that he showed his appreciation of soul music. [...] "Soul music is sexy music, raunchy music. I didn’t {{want it to be}} a niche thing, I wanted to bring it to a mass audience. I wanted cab drivers to <b>listen</b> to it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think pop soul is fabulous, I do, really", he told Simon Hattenstone.|$|R
40|$|Last autumn {{marked the}} 25 th anni-versary of the {{discovery}} of “Lucy. ” While that certainly was a momentous event in paleoanthropology, it had no less profound an effect on my aca-demic life, for it presaged my eventual seduction into the arena of hominid fossil interpretation. My friend John Fleagle, editor of Evolutionary An-thropology, says I may introduce this paper with a history of that experi-ence. He assures me this is appropri-ate <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>now</b> reached the age when young people in the field have no idea who I am...|$|R

30|$|One {{negatively}} coded {{response was}} ‘No, I {{think it is}} not effective’.

6000|$|... "No. It's the end," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{resuming}} at last {{something of the}} hoarse drawl which the tumult of her feeling had broken into those half-articulate appeals. She sat down too, and lifted her face towards him. [...] "It's {{the end of life}} for me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> must have been playing false from the beginning. You don't know what I mean, and I can never tell you. It isn't my secret--it's some one else's. You--you must never come here again. I can't tell you why, and you must never try to know.

5000|$|After {{recording}} 16 studio albums for Columbia Records between 1956 and 1963, Mathis {{accepted an}} offer to switch to the Mercury label with one advantage being {{that he would have}} more control over his recordings. During the first 15 months at his new home, he recorded and released five LPs and began work on number six, which would be exclusively devoted to songs from musicals from the Great White Way or, as he described it, [...] "things <b>I</b> was <b>listening</b> to <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was in New York. I would go to the theater a lot and listen to all that great music from different shows." [...] The first four of his Mercury titles had respectable chart runs in Billboard, but the most recent of them, Olé was the first not to make the magazine's list of (what was now) the top 150 albums of the week since his 1956 Columbia debut.|$|R
30|$|Teacher P: I was saying, {{this process}} has helped me, when I come to compare, when I come to observe <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have stopped <b>now</b> {{thinking}} about how I would do it and looked at actually what are the children doing, how are they achieving that {{and what is the}} teacher doing to get them to achieve that [extract from audio recording of Meeting 3].|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Contemporary Authors: [...] "From the fifties until my husband died in 1970 <b>I</b> wrote plays <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to; <b>now</b> <b>I</b> write them for a living. Although I have never written 'a commercial' play, I have to sell my work. Consequently I think my plays have become less obscure (and pretentious), and I find myself more drawn to comedy. The theatre is my first passion, but I love to write for radio {{and would like to}} write more for TV and would really like to write a film." ...|$|R
3000|$|I was saying, {{this process}} has helped me, when I come to observe <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have stopped <b>now</b> {{thinking}} about how I would do it and looked at actually what are the children doing, how are they achieving that {{and what is the}} teacher doing to get them to achieve that, instead of thinking, oh that’s nice, I’ll nick that, or I’d do it that way, I have switched it back (Meeting 6) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I didn't want to?" [...] Grace suggested. [...] "Well, I do {{not forget}} my friends, and now, if you are satisfied, we can let that go." [...] She paused and resumed when he went on with her: [...] "The dalesfolk have missed you, {{particularly}} since your father died.

2500|$|When viewers {{realized}} that Willow was {{falling in love}} with Tara, Whedon remembered that some threatened to boycott the show, complaining [...] "You made Willow a fag", to which he responded, [...] "Bye. We'll miss you a whole lot." [...] However, he also said, [...] "For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> have someone <b>I</b> can relate to on screen'." [...] Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom Will & Grace was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special If These Walls Could Talk 2 won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. Jane magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that [...] "they hold hands, slow-dance and lay in bed at night. You won't find that kind of normalcy on Will and Grace." [...] Despite Whedon's intentions of not making Buffy about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality [...] "turned {{out to be one of}} the most important things we've done on the show".|$|R
