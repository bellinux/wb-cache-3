50|$|A {{card table}} {{is usually a}} square table with legs that fold up individually, with one <b>leg</b> <b>lining</b> each edge. Card tables are {{traditionally}} used for playing card games, board games, and other tabletop games. Due to their low cost and small storage size, in the United States they are frequently found in college apartments, or as auxiliary seating for family meals such as Thanksgiving. Many folding card tables are used for specialist games such as contract bridge or poker, {{as a result there}} are some folding tables with fabric surfaces such as felt.|$|E

30|$|We assumed {{constant}} {{growth in}} the shorter lower extremity to calculate the projected LLD at maturity from the graph. The date of PETS was plotted on the long <b>leg</b> <b>line</b> based on the most recent measurement of the long leg just prior to surgery. The growth lines on the Moseley graph revealed that surgery on the long leg including a tibial, femoral, or combined epiphysiodesis would have a slope of 72 percent, 63 percent, or 35 percent of normal growth, respectively. Thirteen patients had sufficient data {{to be included in}} the Moseley calculations.|$|R
5000|$|Ailey {{made use}} of any {{combination}} of dance techniques that best suited the theatrical moment. Valuing eclecticism, he created more a dance style than a technique. He said that what he wanted from a dancer was a long, unbroken <b>leg</b> <b>line</b> and deftly articulated legs and feet ("a ballet bottom") combined with a dramatically expressive upper torso ("a modern top"). [...] "What I like is the line and technical range that classical ballet gives to the body. But I still want to project to the audience the expressiveness that only modern dance offers, especially for the inner kinds of things." ...|$|R
50|$|Urgo-Hem {{was freed}} from {{imprisonment}} through {{the blood of}} a 16th-century Spanish priest. The priest had spent time in Tenochtitlan before it burned, and had learned {{the history of the}} Ogdru Hem there. After being persecuted by the inquisition for his knowledge, the priest was eventually squirrelled away by a secret order dedicated to preserving treasures of the ancient world. When Hellboy stumbled across him, the priest's blood released Urgo-Hem. Apparently an aquatic beast, this child of the Ogdru Jahad resembled an eyeless serpent with sharp crustacean <b>legs</b> <b>lining</b> its pale underbelly. After a bloody conflict, Urgo Hem impaled itself on the mast of a nearby shipwreck, and Hellboy escaped.|$|R
50|$|In dance, the {{perceived}} {{quality of a}} split leap or split jump depends {{in large part on}} the application of various dance techniques. In particular, emphasis is often placed on pointing the feet while airborne, especially during the split, so as to extend the <b>leg</b> <b>lines.</b> Also, proper technique (i.e., best practice) typically calls for straight legs (except in stag variations) and a full split position at the apex of the leap or jump. Ballon, which is the appearance of effortless and weightless movement, is another important aesthetic. There are, however, variations that run counter to traditional dance techniques. For example, the feet may be intentionally oriented at right angles to the legs to produce a notable, unusual aesthetic.|$|R

40|$|The random {{waypoint}} model (RWP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used mobility models in performance analysis of ad hoc networks. We analyze two key properties of the RWP model in a given convex area: the stationary spatial distribution for the location of the node and the mean length of a <b>leg</b> (<b>line</b> between two waypoints). A general expression is given for the spatial node distribution in the form of a one-dimensional integral, giving the density up to a normalization constant. The mean length of a leg can be obtained through the normalization constant or by an alternative expression in the form of a two-dimensional integral. Similar analytical results are also given for a modified version of RWP, where the waypoints are chosen randomly on the perimeter...|$|R

500|$|The fitness {{boom of the}} 1980s led to one of {{the biggest}} leaps in the {{evolution}} of the bikini. According to Mills, [...] "The <b>leg</b> <b>line</b> became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin." [...] Women's magazines used terms like [...] "Bikini Belly", and workout programs were launched to develop a [...] "bikini-worthy body". The tiny [...] "fitness-bikinis" [...] made of lycra were launched to cater to this hardbodied ideal. Movies like Blue Crush and TV reality shows like Surf Girls merged the concepts of bikini models and athletes together, further accentuating the toned body ideal. Some women, motivated by yearly Spring Break festivities that mark the start of the bikini season in North America, engage in eating disorders in an attempt to achieve the ideal bikini body.|$|R
50|$|The pin and pivot dart {{rotation}} technique requires tracing a new pattern {{from the}} original. First, the pattern with the dart {{to be rotated}} is set {{on top of another}} piece of paper on which the new pattern will be traced. A pin is pressed into the dart point to hold that point in place. Then one leg of the original dart and an arbitrary part of the original pattern is traced onto the paper. This tracing starts from the one dart leg and continues from there to the new point where the dart will reach the outside of the pattern piece. The pattern is then rotated around the pinned dart point until the other dart <b>leg</b> <b>lines</b> up with the traced dart leg. Tracing can then continue from the same spot on the original pattern. The pattern is then removed and the new dart legs drawn between the dart point (marked by the pin hole) and the gap in the pattern created during rotation.|$|R
50|$|The Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is {{involved}} in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show-strain breed. The show-strains have been bred with an extremely sloping topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind <b>legs.</b> Working-pedigree <b>lines,</b> such as those in common use as service dogs, generally retain the traditional straight back of the breed.|$|R
50|$|Short-legged cats {{have been}} {{documented}} {{a number of times}} around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of healthy short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the <b>legs.</b> This <b>line</b> disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality index}} for a {{redundant}} 4 - 4 inparallel manipulator with a square platform and a square base was obtained in [1]. Following this, the quality index for a redundant 4 - 8 manipulator with a square platform and an octagonal base was determined in [2]. In this paper the optimal quality index for a redundant 8 - 8 manipulator is determined. The device has an octagonalplatform {{and a similar}} octagonal base connected by eight legs. The quality index {{is defined as a}} dimensionless ratio which takes a maximum value of 1 at a central symmetrical configuration that is shown to correspond to the maximum value of the square root of the determinant of the product of the manipulator Jacobian by its transpose. The Jacobian matrix is none other than the normalized coordinates of the eight <b>leg</b> <b>lines.</b> It is shown that the quality index {{can be used as a}} constructive measure of not only acceptable and optimum design proportions but also an acceptable operating workspace (in the static stability sense) [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|In most Of the {{practical}} six-actuator in-parallel manipulators, the octahedral form is either taken {{as it stands}} or is approximated. Yet considerable theoretical attention is paid in the literature to more general forms. Here we touch on the general form, and describe some aspects of its behavior that vitiate strongly against its adoption as a pattern for a realistic manipulate,: We reach {{the conclusion that the}} structure for in-parallel manipulators must be triangulated as fully as possible, so leading to the octahedral form. In describing some of the geometrical properties of the general octahedron, we show how they apply to manipulators. We examine in detail the special configurations at which the 6 x 6 matrix of <b>leg</b> <b>lines</b> is singular presenting results {{from the point of view}} of geometry in preference to analysis. In extending and enlarging on some known properties, a few behavioral surprises materialize. In studying special configurations, we start with the most general situation, and every other case derives from this. Our coverage is more comprehensive than any that we have found. We bring to light material that is, we think, of significant use to a designer...|$|R

50|$|Pocock first {{described}} the Sumatran tiger {{on the basis}} of several skull, pelage, and striping features, which are distinct from the Bengal and Javan tigers. It is darker in fur colour and has broader stripes than the Javan tiger. Stripes tend to dissolve into spots near their ends, and on the back, flanks and hind <b>legs</b> are <b>lines</b> of small, dark small spots between regular stripes. The frequency of stripes is higher than in other subspecies.Males have a prominent ruff, which is especially marked in the Sumatran tiger.|$|R
5000|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to create an isolated drive with op-amp circuitry alone, it is possible to create a floating output. This is important if one <b>leg</b> of the <b>line</b> might become grounded or connected to some other voltage reference. Grounding one <b>leg</b> of the <b>line</b> in the circuit of figure 6 will result in the line voltage being halved since only one op-amp is now providing signal. To achieve a floating output additional feedback paths are required between the two op-amps resulting in a more complex circuit than figure 6, but still avoiding the expense of a transformer. A floating op-amp output can only float within the limits of the op-amp's supply rails. [...] An isolated output can be achieved without transformers with the addition of opto-isolators.|$|R
