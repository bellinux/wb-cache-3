5|$|At {{the same}} time that the U.S. forces were mobilizing, Shōji and his troops were {{beginning}} to reach Koli Point east of the Metapona River at Gavaga Creek. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> 31 CAF aircraft attacked Shōji's forces, inflicting about 100 deaths and injuries on the Japanese. Some of the CAF aircraft also mistakenly attacked Hanneken's men, causing several deaths and injuries to the Marines.|$|E
5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
50|$|Orb-3 {{carried a}} variety of NASA-manifested payloads, some {{determined}} fairly <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> before <b>the</b> launch.

The first BA to exit service was BA 554 in May 1963, and through the mid-1960s, the class was progressively withdrawn. At the start of 1969, only one was left in service, BA 552.|$|R
5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> as the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message:All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your own and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.|$|E

5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when Compton, who {{had reached a}} century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it was too <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, ESPN's Mel Kiper, Jr. had Slay as one of his top 25 NFL draft {{prospects}} and many believed Slay would, at the very least, go <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> of <b>the</b> draft. However, after a poor pro-day workout at the NFL combine, Slay's status dropped significantly.|$|R
60|$|The {{renewal of}} the assault here broke off their conversation, nor did the active enemy permit them to enjoy much repose until sunset; for, {{alarming}} them with repeated menaces of attack upon different points, besides making two or three formidable and furious assaults, they left them scarce time to breathe, or to take a moment's refreshment. Yet the Welsh paid a severe price for their temerity; for, while nothing could exceed the bravery with which their men repeatedly advanced to the attack, those which were made <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> had less of animated desperation than their first onset; and it is probable, that the sense of having sustained great loss, and apprehension of its effects on the spirits of his people, made nightfall, and the interruption of the contest, as acceptable to Gwenwyn as to the exhausted garrison of the Garde Doloureuse.|$|R
5|$|England {{came out}} for their second innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E
5|$|England {{set about}} {{extending}} their first innings lead {{for the remainder}} of the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57, leaving England at 129/2. Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off, adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54. England lost wickets at regular intervals <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to be 278/6. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, England were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362/8 at the close of the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42—England's highest opening {{partnership}} {{of the series}} thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E
60|$|The {{friendship}} between Ethel and Laura, which the last narrated sentimental occurrences {{had so much}} increased, subsists very little impaired up to <b>the</b> present <b>day.</b> A lady with many domestic interests and increasing family, etc. etc., cannot be supposed to cultivate female intimacies out of doors with that ardour and eagerness which young spinsters exhibit in their intercourse; but Laura, whose kind heart first led her to sympathise with her young friend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter's <b>days</b> of distress and misfortune, has professed ever since a growing esteem for Ethel Newcome, and says, that the trials and perhaps grief which the young lady now had to undergo have brought out the noblest qualities of her disposition. She {{is a very different}} person from the giddy and worldly girl who compelled our admiration of <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of her triumphant youthful beauty, of her wayward generous humour, of her frivolities and her flirtations.|$|R
25|$|The 8th {{received}} orders on 27 March {{to secure}} the road running from Hamm to Soest. CCA attacked on the left flank and captured Im Loh {{then moved on to}} bypass Dorsten.

5|$|In the lead-up to the decider, Woodfull {{ran into}} form. In {{consecutive}} innings, he scored 131 and 228 not out against Gloucestershire and Glamorgan respectively. However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire. In the first innings, Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237. Bill Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed it with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese {{were killed or}} wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|The teams then {{played out}} a rain-affected {{draw in the}} Third Test match at Manchester, where England elected to bat first. On the first day, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught by Tallon for 32, leaving England at 5/119. Compton returned at the fall of Edrich's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied {{in the head by}} a Lindwall bouncer. He batted to stumps, after being dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before again being dropped on 64 <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> by the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston. England closed at 7/231 with Compton on 64.|$|E
50|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Kilmarnock, N'Guessan signed for National League Maidstone United in December 2016. He made his debut as a <b>late</b> substitute <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Boxing <b>Day</b> 1-1 draw with Dover Athletic.|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} Drunen is a plaza {{surrounded}} by the Sint-Lambertuskerk and city hall. Furthermore, there are some pubs and stores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of town. Drunen was heavily shelled by British Forces <b>in</b> <b>late</b> 1944 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> prior to liberation and its main buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed outright. In consequence, there are few historic buildings. Recently the downtown area, including the plaza, has been modernized.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> third Test at Kolkata, Shastri made 111 in 357 {{balls and}} 455 minutes, though his innings was heavily {{interrupted}} by rain. With Mohammad Azharuddin he added 214 {{for the fifth}} wicket, another Indian record. When India started <b>the</b> second innings <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>day,</b> he was sent in to open, thus {{becoming one of the}} few batsmen to bat on all five days of a Test.|$|R
5|$|By early 1918, {{the long}} periods of {{inactivity}} had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including Kaiser Karl VI. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to Kaiser Karl VI. Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to {{an end to the}} war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on 2 February, the red flags were struck from Kaiser Karl VI and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor. The next morning, the s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. <b>Late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
5|$|In a {{match between}} the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline {{practitioners}} of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E
5000|$|The trial {{took place}} on October 3-4, 1944, with an all-white, all-male jury. However, none of the assailants had been arrested, which meant that the only {{witnesses}} were Taylor's black friends and family. Taylor's family could not identify {{the names of the}} assailants, and since Sheriff Gamble [...] "never arranged a police line-up, Taylor could not identify her attackers <b>in</b> court". Also, <b>the</b> $250 bond Gamble placed Wilson and his accomplices under [...] "were issued <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after Taylor's hearing". After five minutes of deliberation, the jury dismissed the case. The only way it could be re-opened would be through an indictment from the grand jury.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> final <b>day</b> {{started off}} with India on 18/1 (having lost Irfan Pathan <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>day)</b> and <b>the</b> first session was seen out relatively safely, with only 2 wickets falling, one of those being that of the nightwatchman Kumble. Scoring was very slow, and Dravid had faced over 50 deliveries for 9 runs by the lunch interval. Tendulkar had scored more freely, but overall the score at lunch was 75/3.|$|R
2500|$|A new {{retractable}} {{roof was}} built <b>in</b> time for <b>the</b> 2009 championships, marking {{the first time}} that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on Centre Court. The Club tested the new roof at an event called A Centre Court Celebration on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Kim Clijsters and Tim Henman. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between Dinara Safina and Amélie Mauresmo. [...] The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match completed <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02pm in a victory over Marcos Baghdatis at Centre Court <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third round of the 2012 Championships.
