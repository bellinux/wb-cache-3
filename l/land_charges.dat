5000|$|An {{employee}} of the authority failed to exercise reasonable skill and care in searching for entries in the local <b>land</b> <b>charges</b> register. The search certificate prepared by the clerk negligently failed to record a charge of £1,828 11s. 5d. in favour of the Ministry.|$|E

50|$|Un{{registered}} land in English law is {{land that}} has not been registered with HM Land Registry.

25|$|AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and {{operates}} a 'dual-till' approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets. Aeronautical income {{is derived from}} airfield charges, terminal services charge and the airport development charge (or departure fee). Non-aeronautical revenue comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Income from the non-aeronautical {{side of the business}} accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high <b>landing</b> <b>charges.</b> However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand. Further research by aviation consultants Airbiz conducted in August 2010 indicates that Auckland Airport domestic <b>landing</b> <b>charges</b> are amongst the lowest in Australasia.|$|R

5000|$|On top {{of these}} basic rules, the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Act 1972, {{following}} its 1925 predecessor, required that {{some kinds of}} charges had to be entered on another special register of charges for unregistered land. According to section 2, a puisne mortgage (a second or third mortgage created after a property is already mortgaged) had to be registered before it would be binding, {{even though it had}} previously counted as a legal property right.|$|E
50|$|Crown debt, in English law, a {{debt due}} to the crown. By various statutes, the first dating from the reign of Henry VIII of England (in 1541), the crown has {{priority}} for its debts before all other creditors. At common law the crown always had a lien on the lands and goods of debtors by record, which could be enforced even when they had passed {{into the hands of}} other persons. The difficulty of ascertaining whether lands were subject to a crown lien or not was often very great, and a remedy was provided by the Judgments Act 1839, and the Crown Suits Act Coronets of Viscounts and Barons 1865. Now by the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Act 1900, no debt {{due to the}} crown operates as a charge on land until a writ of execution for the purpose of enforcing it has been registered under the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Registration and Searches Act 1888. By the Act of 1541 specialty debts were put practically on the same footing as debts by record. Simple contract debts due to the crown also become specialty debts, and the rights of the crown are enforced by a summary process called an extent.|$|E

30|$|Littlechild and Owen (1973) {{discussed}} {{the problem of}} computing Shapley value for large games.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, a local {{authority}} search (also known as local <b>land</b> <b>charges</b> search or local search) {{refers to the}} provision of specific information about a particular property {{and the surrounding area}} for buyers and sellers. This is undertaken as part of the conveyancing process by a solicitor or a licensed conveyancer. If you are borrowing money to finance the purchase it will normally be a condition of the advance that you obtain a local search. If you are not having finance it is your option whether to have a local search or not.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a package of}} reforms were made to {{register}} land in England and Wales to make conveyancing cheaper and simpler, and free land to the market. The main legislation was the Land Registration Act 1925, the Law of Property Act 1925, the Trustee Act 1925, and the Settled Land Act 1925. However, much land was to remain unregistered. Instead, for that land not yet registered, people could choose to explicitly register interests under the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Act 1925, and so get better protection than the common law might provide against a bona fide purchaser without notice of any equitable interest sought to be protected. In 1972, this Act was updated into the present scheme.|$|E
5000|$|Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp 1970 2 QB 223, {{the local}} {{authority}} was held liable to the Ministry {{because of the}} failure of an employee of the authority to exercise reasonable skill and care in searching for entries in the local <b>land</b> <b>charges</b> register. The search certificate prepared by the clerk negligently failed to record a charge of £1,828 11s. 5d. in favour of the Ministry. Lord Denning MR, 268, rejected that a duty of care only arose when there was a voluntary assumption of responsibility, rather [...] "from the fact that the person making it knows, or ought to know, that others, being his neighbours in this regard, would act on the faith of the statement being accurate." ...|$|E

50|$|On 16 January 2014 HM Land Registry (which is {{responsible}} for the collation and maintenance of records of ownership and charges (mortgages) relating to land/property) has issued a press release informing of a project that it has undertaken {{for the past two years}} with a view to the taking over of the local <b>land</b> <b>charges</b> function from local authorities. HMLR PRESS RELEASE (Archived) The intention is to centralise the records in a digital and uniform format (which contrasts with the diverse formats utilised by the 348 local authorities in England and Wales) and to provide as single point of reference to fulfil the same function as the above mentioned search reports. The press release coincides with a consultation exercise which is accessible from the press release link above.|$|E
50|$|The {{solicitor}} or {{licensed conveyancer}} acts {{on behalf of}} the property buyer or the tenant, and liaises with the local authority who are responsible for carrying out the local authority search. The timescale for the return of the search result depends on which local authority carries out the search. The majority of local authorities return search results in under 5 working days. It is also possible to undertake a personal search of the local <b>land</b> <b>charges</b> register. This can be done by anyone but requires the searcher to have a knowledge of what they are viewing. A personal search is free. A personal search does not include all of the information required to complete a full local search. The remaining information must be acquired from public registers and viewing information under the environmental information regulations.|$|E
5000|$|An {{equitable}} easement when the servient tenement is unregistered is enforceable against a {{purchaser for value}} only when properly registered {{under the terms of}} the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Act 1972. Equitable easements arising by virtue of a contract to grant an easement are registerable as either estate contracts or {{equitable easement}}s. Where the servient tenement is registered, the registration of an equitable easement at the Land Registry can take place through mere notice or caution and will then bind purchasers. Alternatively, it will still bind purchasers if it constitutes an [...] "overriding interest". As confirmed in the case of Thatcher v Douglas, section 70(1)(c) of the Land Registration Act and rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925 will operate to ensure that almost all equitable easements constitute overriding interests.|$|E
50|$|The RAAF ceased ‘public {{transport}} operations’ on 15 December 1989, by 31 December 1989 regular leasing {{of seats}} on international flights ceased and, by 12 January 1990, the Government ceased its waiver of <b>landing</b> <b>charges.</b> The airlines {{were able to}} slowly return to normal schedules as they hired replacement pilots. Thus no specific date can be set for when the dispute stopped impacting flights, tourism and the economy.|$|R

Ryanair claim the reason they opened the base in Paphos was due to reduced <b>landing</b> <b>charges</b> offered by Hermes' incentive scheme, {{as well as the}} fact that they can easily operate within their standards (e.g. their typical 25 minutes turnaround time).|$|R
