40|$|The {{concept of}} multi-radio access {{networks}} is currently {{considered as a}} strong candidate {{for the next generation}} wireless access networks. This concept incorporates conventional cellular networks such as GERAN or UTRAN for wide area coverage while local-area networks such as IEEE 802. 11, HIPERLAN/ 2, and/or several personal networks (PN) interconnected in ad-hoc fashion are covering the <b>local</b> <b>traffic</b> hot-spot <b>areas.</b> The new radio access systems that will be developed in the future could also be included in this multi-radio concept because it is difficult (if not impossible) to design a single wireless access system that optimally works in different conditions and with different requirements. The radio resource management (RRM) in multi-radio access networks becomes a very challenging issue. The overall goal of the RRM functions is to optimally utilize the available radio resources and give the users the requested communication quality at affordable cost.

In this paper, we propose a direct D 2 D discovery scheme based on the random backoff procedure, where D 2 D UEs randomly choose a backoff interval and retransmit a beacon. Compared with existing schemes, the performance of the proposed scheme can be significantly enhanced in terms of the discovery probability and the discovery delay. Several useful guidelines for its design are proposed based on our analysis. Finally, numerical results provide valuable insights on the performance tradeoff inherent to the proposed D 2 D discovery scheme.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of speed management (“traffic calming”) techniques used in neighbourhood traffic management {{is to change}} the speed profile in local streets so that it does not exceed target street speeds at any point. This paper outlines a suggested process for doing this, employing the concept of maximum “speed differential”, which signifies the severity of speed reduction expected at the location where a speed control device is to be installed. The process essentially involves three stages: measuring (or estimating) current free speeds; specifying the target street speed (thus identifying the required speed change); and designing a device or sequence of devices that achieve the target street speed while complying with the limit set on the speed differential at each device site. This requires a knowledge of the expected speeds at each device, and the typical approach and departure speed profiles. Information on both of these items needs to be collated and more widely exchanged between practitioners. The suggested process, originally conceived for inclusion in the new Australian guide for <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>traffic</b> management, offers guidelines for decisions on device spacings and isolated treatments...|$|R
