When it premiered in 1983, audiences {{questioned}} Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> they saw her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sultan Iskandar {{was accused}} of causing {{the death of a}} golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, {{following}} an incident in which the golf caddy <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. The brother of the caddy – who also suffered injuries from the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to reach}} the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured {{architect}} Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.|$|E

25|$|Cold Food Festival; this solar-based holiday on April 5 (concurrent {{with the}} Qingming Festival) was named so because no fires {{were allowed to}} be lit for three days, hence no warmed or hot food. It was a time to respect one's {{ancestors}} by maintaining their tombs and offering sacrifices, while a picnic would be held later in the day. It was also a time for fun in outdoor activities, with amusement on swing sets, playing cuju football, horse polo, and tug of war. In the year 710, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang had his chief ministers, sons-in-law, and military officers engage {{in a game of}} tug of war, and purportedly <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> the oldest ministers fell over. The imperial throne also presented porridge to officials, and even dyed chicken and duck eggs, similar to the practice on Easter in the Western world.|$|E

500|$|The first {{individual}} {{time trial}} (ITT) of the 2009 Giro {{was a difficult}} one, long with {{quite a lot of}} climbing. There were two categorized climbs on the course, a quick, intense descent between them and no flat stretches at all. Lance Armstrong, who rode the Giro {{for the first time in}} 2009, described the ITT as [...] "wicked hard". Reigning Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara called it [...] "crazy" [...] and <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> asked if he would be a contender for victory. Cancellara was in fact the only rider who was still in the race to this point who did not attempt the time trial, instead abandoning the Giro.|$|E

500|$|The anglicized name Isaac is a {{transliteration}} of the Hebrew term Yiṣḥāq which literally means [...] "He laughs/will laugh." [...] Ugaritic texts {{dating from}} the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell {{on his face and}} <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> God (Hebrew, Elohim) imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.|$|E
500|$|The King was displeased at Liberal {{attacks on}} the peers, which {{included}} a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse. Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare – although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 – that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as [...] "the last King of England". After the King's horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, {{he returned to the}} racetrack the following day, and <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> a man shouted: [...] "Now, King. You've won the Derby.

He designed the six minigames based on Sega's previous intellectual property and licenses—such as ToeJam & Earl—under the instruction to avoid shooting games. His prototypes included games based on Joe Montana (Joe Montana Wide Receiver Training Camp) and David Robinson, but when presented, the company asked for more shooting games and scrapped all license-based games (besides ToeJam & Earl, whose license was free) due to their added cost. His [...] "reverse Blockout game" [...] prototype was the only other title carried to the final cartridge. Senour recalled that upon his cubicle presentation to Sega Japan's president, the executive did not say anything besides [...] "very good" [...] before leaving. Sega did not plan any other first-party releases for the Menacer—Senour recollected that [...] "they <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> I proposed more." ...|$|E

500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or three weeks ago, the title was just a dream for us and people <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> I said we could still do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She {{looked exactly}} like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{discussed}} the idea {{with other members}} of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] and [...] "Final Mission". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wildchild during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse for true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a [...] "bookworm" [...] while at the Academy and only becoming [...] "crazy" [...] once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] that he <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that [...] "It made us all think we had really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever." [...] While Moore called the episode [...] "A Q Carol" [...] based on the original premise, but Piller was the one to suggest [...] "Tapestry" [...] as he said [...] "you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life".|$|E
500|$|According to {{crew member}} Harmen Koops, on , Krause {{ordered him to}} bring on deck some assegais, or African spears, and some swords, for the Malagasy to clean. The assegais had been {{acquired}} on Madagascar along with the Malagasy, {{some of whom were}} experienced in the use of this weapon. Krause believed himself to be intellectually superior to the Malagasy, and is reported to have <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> issuing his order, saying he was sure that others would doubt his wisdom; having set the task, he went below deck for a meal. When the Malagasy had cleaned the weapons and were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, killing all who were left on deck, including Krause, who had returned when the attack began. Also killed in this fight were two of the ship's mates, Bender and Albert, leaving only Daniel Carel Gulik surviving of that rank. Some of the surviving crew climbed into the rigging, and others, including Gulik, Koops, Jan de Leeuw, and Krause's assistant Olof Leij, withdrew to the Constapelskamer, or gunroom, which was below decks at the stern of the ship, near the rudder. Captain Muller, who stated that he had been [...] "gazing out over the sea" [...] {{at the time of the}} attack, was taken by surprise and stabbed three times by Massavana. Muller escaped to his cabin and soon climbed down from a window, via the rudder, to join the others in the gunroom. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had been thrown overboard with others from the rigging, managed to swim around the ship to a rope hanging from the gunroom window, and was pulled to safety by his shipmates. Although the crew who had climbed into the rigging threatened the Malagasy from the fore-mast with hand grenades, [...] "only those that reached the safety of the barricaded ... escaped a brutal death." [...] With Krause dead and Muller wounded, Olof Leij was left in charge of the remaining crew below deck.|$|E
