Legged robots offer significant advantages over their wheeled and treaded counterparts, enabling access to huge sectors of otherwise non-navigable terrain. To develop these walkers many engineers have looked to nature for inspiration, but the field of bipedal research has been focused almost exclusively on human locomotion. Other than Homo sapiens, the only regularly bipedal walkers are members of Theropoda, a clade that includes modern day birds as well as all the carnivorous dinosaurs. Whereas birds evolved extensively for flying, their ancestors, e. g. Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus Rex, were much more specialized for dynamic terrestrial motion. We submit that {{there is good reason to}} look to theropod body geometry for an efficient alternative walking model. In this thesis, a novel model was developed in order to examine the mechanics of such specialized bipedal motion. Instead of a traditional anthropomorphic model maintaining a vertically balanced torso, this research synthesized a dinomorphic model that consists of a horizontal spine with counterbalanced torso and tail masses pivoting around the hip joint. The system model developed herein was an extension of the simple rimless wheel representation and aimed to capture critical events in the cycle of bipedal motion while avoiding chaotic regimes. Mathematical models and computer simulations were designed iteratively and in parallel. Once the system dynamics and the energy losses from inelastic impact were derived, then all the equations were nondimensionalized. Theoretical bounds on efficiency were found, and an attempt was made to experimentally quantify the effects of each geometric system parameter. A region of improved performance was identified, indicating non-negligible benefits to tailed morphologies over tail-less ones. It is suggested that further research might adapt and apply this model to the more complex bipedal compass gait. Ideally these findings will enable and encourage the design of legged robots with a horizontal <b>load-bearing</b> <b>frame,</b> demonstrating advantage over anthropomorphic walkers. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

40|$|Rapidly {{assembled}} tent {{structures are}} temporary enclosures used to house people or goods. Their uses vary to include recreation, refugee housing, and military shelters. The structural concepts applied in these shelters are as variable as their uses. Some {{make use of}} a tensioned fabric and pole system to provide structural strength. Others have a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>frame</b> with attached fabric skin. Further variants make use of inflatable arches or consist of modular containers. Analysis {{of a number of}} different types of rapidly assembled tent structures reveals an area where innovation can occur. Conflicts {{in the last ten years}} suggest that rapidly assembled shelters for both military purposes and humanitarian relief have the greatest need for innovative solutions. Existing shelters used by the military lack the versatility and speed of deployment necessary in modern conflict. The lack of scalability in the designs makes it difficult to use an existing tent in different situations. They are slow to construct, heavy, and difficult to transport in large numbers. These problems suggest that there is a need for new shelters that better meet the needs of the military. The application of deployable structures technology meets military's needs for structures with the advantages of a small compacted volume, rapid assembly, and ease of deployment. This makes them ideal for application to shelter structures. The aim of this dissertation was to develop a new type of deployable, long-span shelter frame based upon tiled Bennett mechanisms. An overlapping combination of equilateral Bennett mechanisms yields a structure that opens into a half-cylinder shape, providing an enclosed space useful and applicable to the problem of deployable shelters. The specific application considered in the design portion of this process will be a long-span deployable shelter capable of housing military helicopters. This report details the development of the Bennett Shelter concept. Its deployed and compacted geometries are explored, and a procedure for determining structural properties and dimensions is presented. The full concept for the structure, from outer covering to foundation support is then detailed. Loads affecting the structure are determined, and the process of modelling and analysing the structure is then considered. Optimisation of the structure with respect to weight and serviceability requirements is conducted using a number of different materials, and full analysis of the optimal geometries is completed. As no method exists for evaluating the effect of imperfections on the deployment of overconstrained mechanisms, a procedure is derived. The effects of manufacturing imperfections on deployment of the Bennett mechanism are then explored using the method. A full examination of the variation of energy within the Bennett Shelter during deployment provides valuable insight into the performance of the structure. With the above analysis complete, it is shown that the Bennett Shelter is viable as a long-span deployable shelter. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Forming {{representative}} gas hydrate-bearing laboratory samples {{is important}} {{so that the}} properties of these materials may be measured, while controlling the composition and other variables. Natural samples are rare, and have often experienced pressure and temperature changes that may affect the property to be measured [Waite et al., 2008]. Forming methane hydrate samples in the laboratory has been done a number of ways, each having advantages and disadvantages. The ice-to-hydrate method [Stern et al., 1996], contacts melting ice with methane at the appropriate pressure to form hydrate. The hydrate can then be crushed and mixed with mineral grains under controlled conditions, and then compacted to create laboratory samples of methane hydrate in a mineral medium. The hydrate in these samples {{will be part of}} the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>frame</b> of the medium. In the excess gas method [Handa and Stupin, 1992], water is distributed throughout a mineral medium (e. g. packed moist sand, drained sand, moistened silica gel, other porous media) and the mixture is brought to hydrate-stable conditions (chilled and pressurized with gas), allowing hydrate to form. This method typically produces grain-cementing hydrate from pendular water in sand [Waite et al., 2004]. In the dissolved gas method [Tohidi et al., 2002], water with sufficient dissolved guest molecules is brought to hydrate-stable conditions where hydrate forms. In the laboratory, this is can be done by pre-dissolving the gas of interest in water and then introducing it to the sample under the appropriate conditions. With this method, it is easier to form hydrate from more soluble gases such as carbon dioxide. It is thought that this method more closely simulates the way most natural gas hydrate has formed. Laboratory implementation, however, is difficult, and sample formation is prohibitively time consuming [Minagawa et al., 2005; Spangenberg and Kulenkampff, 2005]. In another version of this technique, a specified quantity of gas is placed in a sample, then the sample is flooded with water and cooled [Priest et al., 2009]. We have performed a number of tests in which hydrate was formed and the uniformity of the hydrate formation was examined. These tests have primarily used a variety of modifications of the excess gas method to make the hydrate, although we have also used a version of the excess water technique. Early on, we found difficulties in creating uniform samples with a particular sand/ initial water saturation combination (F- 110 Sand, {approx} 35 % initial water saturation). In many of our tests we selected this combination intentionally to determine whether we could use a method to make the samples uniform. The following methods were examined: Excess gas, Freeze/thaw/form, Freeze/pressurize/thaw, Excess gas followed by water saturation, Excess water, Sand and kaolinite, Use of a nucleation enhancer (SnoMax), and Use of salt in the water. Below, each method, the underlying hypothesis, and our results are briefly presented, followed by a brief conclusion. Many of the hypotheses investigated are not our own, but were presented to us. Much of the data presented is from x-ray CT scanning our samples. The x-ray CT scanner provides a three-dimensional density map of our samples. From this map and the physics that is occurring in our samples, we are able to gain an understanding of the spatial nature of the processes that occur, and attribute them to the locations where they occur...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analysed}} {{the results}} {{and the status of}} China's building energy efficiency, explored the new areas of building energy in future: the industrialized composite wall on construction. As China is engaginga process of rapid urbanization,it is believed thatlarge amount of construction will continue for 25 - 30 years, and all of new buildings must be strictly in accordance with the standards of energy-saving by 50 % or 65 % in the processes of design and construction. Chinese construction industry is currently implementing the “Four Savings and Environment Protection” policy, which requires energy, land, water and materials saving and environmental protection in every building project. In Heilongjiang Province, as other areas in China, the requirements of energy-efficient design have been comprehensively and strictly implementedon the new buildingssince 2000. By 2010, energy-efficient design has been completely popularized in all kinds of new buildings by 50 % energy saving compared with the same type of buildings built in 1980 s. According to the requirements of the Ministry of Construction, in the future the further energy efficiency targets should be increased from 50 % to 65 %, meanwhile the main field of building energyefficiencywill been changed from the initial entry points such as the thermal insulation of externalwall, roof, doors and windows to further wide areas, such as the Optimization of building material, component manufacturing, construction quality and method, all of which could be realized by the industrialized composite panels and walls completely. Industrialized composite panels and wallsbring thoroughgoing innovationson wall materials and construction, the improvementof the construction accuracy, so that the wall thermal insulation performance is much higher than traditional buildings. Due to the productionconcentrated in the factory and the batch processing, the energy consumption ofbuilding industrialization is much lower than the traditional human construction at the construction site. The industrialized composite panel and wall of buildings can reduce the loss of the main materials of construction,the assembling construction reduce the loss of Secondary buildingmaterials. Compared with traditional construction methods, building industrialization of the composite panelrealizesthe field fabricated construction, which greatly minimizes the generation of construction waste, building waste water emissions, construction noise interference, harmful gases and dust emissions, and so on. The Building industrialization could maximize the improvement of the quality of components and assembly precision, and effectively reduce the roof leaks, wall cracks, quality defects of wall and window such as cold air infiltration, so the architectural quality and accuracy can be improved significantly. Factory production and on-site assembling of prefabricated components can reduce the workers of construction site and management, saving a lot of labor costs. Building industrialization transfer most of the operation to production line, saving construction cost and schedule greatly. It is particularly important to the construction in cold areas. Moreover, three types of building composite walls and panel are introduced. In this paper, composite walls and panel include composite material, composite structure or both of them applied in the wall and panel. The first kind of composite wall is the straw board. The straw board is clean, which is made of natural straw or wheat straw as the main raw material. This kind of straw board is mainly used for internal and external walls of the building and roof of the building, etc. Straw board whichis regarded as wall materials generally does not work as load-bearing walls. When it comes to application, the surface should be decorated to ensure that its fire, moisture, fire-retardant abilities. Straw board is not only suitable for <b>load-bearing</b> <b>frame</b> structure buildings, including civil construction, light industrial plants, but also for the old buildings which need to be rebuild, storage buildings and temporary buildings, etc. It is a lightweight, high strength, thermal insulation board which is new and environmentally friendly, particularly suitable to use in cold regions construction. The second example is the HS-EPS core column structure system, whichis invented by Harbin Hong Sheng housing energy system research and development centre with the whole intellectual property patents. This system consists of base beam, EPS moulded wall composed with core column of reinforced concrete, eaves ring beam and roof trusses and other components, is suitable for various types of single storeybuildings. EPS module consists of polystyrene beads by heating and foaming, through a dedicated heat moulding equipment and moulds in the system with closed-cell structure of different types, different specifications and different shape. The modules are rectangular, which internal and external surfaces distribute the uniform dovetails. There are two bridges connecting the fixed plug door in the middle of three 200 mm × 240 mm rectangular hole, both inside and outside of the hole wall thickness is 50 mm. In 2010, itwas applied in Piaohe town as a pilot project and in Antu County as 800 post-disaster housing, where thissystem has been widely recognized. The third sample is Gao Ge Composite Panel of Husk Mortar, with the both advantages of composite material and composite structure. This panelis precast, made from light husk mortar, welded wire mesh and steel as the skeleton, and thermal, noise insulation layers. The husk mortar is made of cement, sand, husks and water by mixing. This panel can be used to the wall-bearing housing, and multi-storied and high-rise reinforced concrete frame construction as the envelope, its overall size is the same with the external wall of a room, as in Four sides of the panel are joined with the beams and columns of the buildings. The wall panel consists of two surface layer of husk mortar, and two insulation layer (benzene or rock cotton) and a air layer inside. The two surface layers are connected by the vertical and horizontal reinforced ribs, and the insulation layers are spliced inside by mortar, each small insulation board was totally fixed by insulation mortar from 5 surfaces. The cavities between two insulation layers are supported by the ribs...|$|E

40|$|Much of our {{knowledge}} of hydrate distribution in the subsurface comes from interpretations of remote seismic measurements.

We find that a single choice of these parameters allows us to match well both P and S wave velocity measurements from both laboratory and in situ datasets, and that the inferred proportion of hydrate that is load-bearing varies approximately linearly with hydrate saturation. This proportion appears to decrease with increasing hydrate saturation for gas-rich laboratory environments, but increase with hydrate saturation when hydrate is formed from solution and for an in situ example...|$|R

40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is an {{agricultural}} crop {{that can be}} used as a building material in combination with lime and cement. A composite building material that combines a cementitious binder (building limes and cement) with hemp shives, the woody core of the hemp stalk is generally referred to as hemp concrete (HC). However, industrial facilities to separate hemp shives and fibres are currently not available in Sweden. HC has many advantages as a building material but it is not load-bearing and must be used in combination with a <b>load-bearing</b> wooden <b>frame.</b> The aim of this research was to elucidate the feasibility of using both hemp shives and fibres in a HC to determine an optimal mix of the different binding agents and to investigate if adding undensified microsilica to the mix and using calcinated gypsum as a binder would improve mechanical strength of the material. The effects on compressive strength of pre-mixing the binder or creating perforations in the test specimens were also investigated. Cube and cylinder specimens cured for 40 days in a carbonation room (4. 5 vol% CO 2) were tested for mechanical properties, water sorption and frost resistance. Including more hydraulic lime or undensified microsilica in the mix did not significantly affect mechanical strength, whereas adding more cement to the mix increased mechanical strength. Calcinated gypsum as a binder gave mechanical properties of the same magnitude of a contemporary HC. Pre-mixing the binder created a more homogeneous material but it did not seem to play an important role in final mechanical properties. The perforations created in some of the test specimens produced a material with a lower Young’s modulus and higher deformation at rupture. Using both shives and fibres in a hemp concrete may be a suitable approach in Sweden until facilities for separating hemp fibres from shives become available...|$|R
50|$|In 1903 he was {{appointed}} as architect for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) to design stations for three underground railway lines then under construction - the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR), the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR) and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR), which, respectively, became parts of the present day Piccadilly line, Bakerloo line and Northern line.
