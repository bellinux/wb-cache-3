5000|$|Bisabolol, or more {{formally}} α-(−)-bisabolol or {{also known}} as <b>levomenol,</b> is a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol. It is a colorless viscous oil that is the primary constituent of the essential oil from German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) and Myoporum crassifolium. [...] It is almost insoluble in water and glycerin, but very soluble in ethanol. The enantiomer, α-(+)-bisabolol, is also found naturally but is rare. Synthetic bisabolol is usually a racemic mixture of the two, α-(±)-bisabolol.|$|E
